       "'1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A CHEERFUL TEMPER  by Hans Christian Andersen  FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a \"good  temper.\"\\n \"And who was my father?\"\\n That has nothing to do with the good  temper; but I will say he was lively, good-looking round, and fat;  he was both in appearance and character a complete contradiction to  his profession.\"\\n\"And pray what was his profession and his standing  in respectable society?\"\\n Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a  book these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would  lay the book down and say, \"It seems to me a very miserable title, I  don\\'t like things of this sort.\"\\n And yet my father was not a  skin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary, his employment  placed him at the head of the grandest people of the town, and it  was his place by right.\"\\nHe had to precede the bishop, and even the  princes of the blood; he always went first,- he was a hearse driver!\"\\n There, now, the truth is out.\"\\nAnd I will own, that when people saw  my father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed in  his long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered hat  on his head, and then glanced at his round, jocund face, round as  the sun, they could not think much of sorrow or the grave.\"\\nThat face  said, \"It is nothing, it will all end better than people think.\"\\n So  I have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of  going often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper  humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just as he used to  do.\"\\n I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a  library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for  me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father.\"\\nIt  is of great use, for it contains all that a man requires to know;  the names of the preachers at the church, and the new books which  are published; where houses, servants, clothes, and provisions may  be obtained.\"\\nAnd then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and  what innocent verses!\"\\nPersons seeking interviews and engagements,  all so plainly and naturally stated.\"\\nCertainly, a man who takes in the  Intelligencer may live merrily and be buried contentedly, and by the  end of his life will have such a capital stock of paper that he can  lie on a soft bed of it, unless he prefers wood shavings for his  resting-place.\"\\nThe newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting  objects to me.\"\\nMy walks to the latter were like bathing-places to my  good humor.\"\\nEvery one can read the newspaper for himself, but come  with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are  green, and let us wander among the graves.\"\\nEach of them is like a  closed book, with the back uppermost, on which we can read the title  of what the book contains, but nothing more.\"\\nI had a great deal of  information from my father, and I have noticed a great deal myself.\"\\n I keep it in my diary, in which I write for my own use and pleasure  a history of all who lie here, and a few more beside.\"\\n Now we are in the churchyard.\"\\nHere, behind the white iron  railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of  evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils,  and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet  while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position.\"\\nHe had  enough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing to his  refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him.\"\\nIf he went to  a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite  annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of  the moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes  when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was  introduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin,  or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of  Norway.\"\\nAs if these things were of any consequence!\"\\nWhy did he not  leave them alone?\"\\nWho would trouble themselves about such trifles?\"\\n especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.\"\\nThen  sometimes the public applauded too much, or too little, to please him.\"\\n \"They are like wet wood,\" he would say, looking round to see what sort  of people were present, \"this evening; nothing fires them.\"\\n Then he  would vex and fret himself because they did not laugh at the right  time, or because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted  and worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself  into the grave.\"\\n Here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high birth and  position, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he would have been  scarcely worth notice.\"\\nIt is beautiful to observe how wisely nature  orders these things.\"\\nHe walked about in a coat embroidered all over,  and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich  pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind  them always hangs a good thick cord for use.\"\\nThis man also had a  stout, useful substitute behind him, who did duty for him, and  performed all his dirty work.\"\\nAnd there are still, even now, these  serviceable cords behind other embroidered bell-ropes.\"\\nIt is all so  wisely arranged, that a man may well be in a good humor.\"\\n Here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!-  but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never  remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of  having a good idea.\"\\nAt last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that  he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy  at the thought of having at last caught an idea.\"\\nNobody got anything  by it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing was.\"\\nNow I can  imagine that this same idea may prevent him from resting quietly in  his grave; for suppose that to produce a good effect, it is  necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and that he can only  make his appearance on earth at midnight, as ghosts are believed  generally to do; why then this good idea would not suit the hour,  and the man would have to carry it down again with him into the grave\\ufffethat must be a troubled grave.\"\\n The woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy, that during  her life she would get up in the night and mew, that her neighbors  might think she kept a cat.\"\\nWhat a miser she was!\"\\n Here rests a young lady, of a good family, who would always make  her voice heard in society, and when she sang \"Mi manca la voce,\"*  it was the only true thing she ever said in her life.\"\\n * \"I want a voice,\" or, \"I have no voice.\"\\n  Here lies a maiden of another description.\"\\nShe was engaged to be  married,- but, her story is one of every-day life; we will leave her  to rest in the grave.\"\\n Here rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried gall in  her heart.\"\\nShe used to go round among the families near, and search  out their faults, upon which she preyed with all the envy and malice  of her nature.\"\\nThis is a family grave.\"\\nThe members of this family held  so firmly together in their opinions, that they would believe in no  other.\"\\nIf the newspapers, or even the whole world, said of a certain  subject, \"It is so-and-so;\" and a little schoolboy declared he had  learned quite differently, they would take his assertion as the only  true one, because he belonged to the family.\"\\nAnd it is well known that  if the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to crow at  midnight, they would declare it was morning, although the watchman and  all the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at  night.\"\\n The great poet Goethe concludes his Faust with the words, \"may  be continued;\" so might our wanderings in the churchyard be continued.\"\\n I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are not my  friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot of ground  in which to bury him or her.\"\\nThen I bury them, as it were; there  they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better  characters.\"\\nTheir lives and their deeds, looked at after my own  fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do.\"\\nThen,  if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about  it.\"\\nLet them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good  temper.\"\\nThey can also read the Intelligencer, which is a paper written  by the people, with their hands guided.\"\\nWhen the time comes for the  history of my life, to be bound by the grave, then they will write  upon it as my epitaph-  \"The man with a cheerful temper.\"\\n  And this is my story.\"\\n THE END  .\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A GREAT GRIEF  by Hans Christian Andersen  THIS story really consists of two parts.\"\\nThe first part might be  left out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are useful  We were staying in the country at a gentleman\\'s seat, where it  happened that the master was absent for a few days.\"\\nIn the meantime,  there arrived from the next town a lady; she had a pug dog with her,  and came, she said, to dispose of shares in her tan-yard.\"\\nShe had  her papers with her, and we advised her to put them in an envelope,  and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the estate,  \"General War-Commissary Knight,\" &c.\"\\n She listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused, and begged  us to repeat the direction slowly.\"\\nWe complied, and she wrote; but  in the midst of the \"General War-\" she struck fast, sighed deeply, and  said, \"I am only a woman!\"\\n Her Puggie had seated itself on the  ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for  amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor  ought not to be offered to a visitor.\"\\nHis outward appearance was  characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back.\"\\n \"He doesn\\'t bite,\" said the lady; \"he has no teeth.\"\\nHe is like one  of the family, faithful and grumpy; but the latter is my  grandchildren\\'s fault, for they have teased him; they play at wedding,  and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid, and that\\'s too much  for him, poor old fellow.\"\\n  And she delivered her papers, and took Puggie upon her arm.\"\\nAnd  this is the first part of the story which might have been left out.\"\\n PUGGIE DIED!!\"\\nThat\\'s the second part.\"\\n It was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town, and put  up at the inn.\"\\nOur windows looked into the tan-yard, which was divided  into two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were many skins  and hides, raw and tanned.\"\\nHere was all the apparatus necessary to  carry on a tannery, and it belonged to the widow.\"\\nPuggie had died in  the morning, and was to be buried in this part of the yard; the  grandchildren of the widow (that is, of the tanner\\'s widow, for Puggie  had never been married) filled up the grave, and it was a beautiful  grave- it must have been quite pleasant to lie there.\"\\n The grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and strewn  over with sand; quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle,  with the neck upwards, and that was not at all allegorical.\"\\n The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys  among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition  that there should be an exhibition of Puggie\\'s burial-place for all  who lived in the lane; the price of admission was to be a trouser  button, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each might also  give one for a little girl.\"\\nThis proposal was adopted by acclamation.\"\\n And all the children out of the lane- yes, even out of the  little lane at the back- flocked to the place, and each gave a button.\"\\n Many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one  suspender; but then they had seen Puggie\\'s grave, and the sight was  worth much more.\"\\n But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a  little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly  hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into  them.\"\\nThe child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each time the  little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the yard.\"\\nShe  had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained  standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave  and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands  before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen  Puggie\\'s grave.\"\\nIt was a grief as great to her as any grown person can  experience.\"\\n We saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many a grief  of our own and of others can make us smile!\"\\nThat is the story, and  whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the  tan-yard from the window.\"\\n THE END  .\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A LEAF FROM HEAVEN  by Hans Christian Andersen  HIGH up in the clear, pure air flew an angel, with a flowerplucked from the garden  of heaven.\"\\nAs he was kissing the flower a verylittle leaf fell from it and sunk down  into the soft earth in themiddle of a wood.\"\\nIt immediately took root, sprouted, and  sent outshoots among the other plants.\"\\n \"What a ridiculous little shoot!\"\\n said one.\"\\n\"No one will recognizeit; not even the  thistle nor the stinging-nettle.\"\\n  \"It must be a kind of garden plant,\" said another; and so theysneered and despised  the plant as a thing from a garden.\"\\n \"Where are you coming?\"\\n said the tall thistles whose leaves wereall armed with thorns.\"\\n \"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself toshoot out in this way; we are not here  to support you.\"\\n  Winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the snowglittered over it as  if it had sunshine beneath as well as above.\"\\n When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a morebeautiful object than any  other plant in the forest.\"\\nAnd now theprofessor of botany presented himself, one who  could explain hisknowledge in black and white.\"\\nHe examined and tested the plant, but  itdid not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly find outto what class  it did belong.\"\\n\"It must be some degenerate species,\"said he; \"I do not know it, and  it is not mentioned in any system.\"\\n  \"Not known in any system!\"\\n repeated the thistles and the nettles.\"\\n The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard theremarks, but they said  not a word either good or bad, which is thewisest plan for those who are ignorant.\"\\n There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her heartwas pure, and her  understanding increased by her faith.\"\\nHer chiefinheritance had been an old Bible,  which she read and valued.\"\\nFrom itspages she heard the voice of God speaking to her,  and telling her toremember what was said of Joseph\\'s brethren when persons wished  toinjure her.\"\\n\"They imagined evil in their hearts, but God turned itto good.\"\\n If we  suffer wrongfully, if we are misunderstood ordespised, we must think of Him who was  pure and holy, and who prayedfor those who nailed Him to the cross, \"Father forgive  them, forthey know not what they do.\"\\n  The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the greenleaves exhaled a sweet  and refreshing fragrance, and the flowersglittered and sparkled in the sunshine like  colored flames, and theharmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each  concealedwithin itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of years couldnot  exhaust.\"\\nWith pious gratitude the girl looked upon this gloriouswork of God, and bent  down over one of the branches, that she mightexamine the flower and inhale the sweet  perfume.\"\\nThen a light broke inon her mind, and her heart expanded.\"\\nGladly would she  have plucked aflower, but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off.She  knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single greenleaf, carried it home,  and laid it in her Bible, where it remainedever green, fresh, and unfading.\"\\nBetween  the pages of the Bible itstill lay when, a few weeks afterwards, that Bible was laid  underthe young girl\\'s head in her coffin.\"\\nA holy calm rested on her face,as if the  earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she nowstood in the presence of  God.\"\\n In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till itgrew and became  almost a tree, and all the birds of passage bowedthemselves before it.\"\\n \"That plant is a foreigner, no doubt,\" said the thistles and theburdocks.\"\\n\"We can  never conduct ourselves like that in thiscountry.\"\\n And the black forest snails  actually spat at the flower.\"\\n Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and shrubsto burn them for the  ashes.\"\\nHe pulled up the wonderful plant, rootsand all, and placed it in his bundle.\"\\n \"This will be as useful as any,\"he said; so the plant was carried away.\"\\n Not long after, the king of the country suffered from thedeepest melancholy.\"\\nHe was  diligent and industrious, but employmentdid him no good.\"\\nThey read deep and learned  books to him, and then thelightest and most trifling that could be found, but all  to no purpose.Then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world,and  he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy whichwould relieve and cure  him, and that it was a plant of heavenly originwhich grew in the forest in the king\\'s  own dominions.\"\\nThe messengerdescribed the flower so that is appearance could not be  mistaken.\"\\n Then said the swineherd, \"I am afraid I carried this plant awayfrom the forest in  my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes long ago.But I did not know any better.\"\\n  \"You did not know, any better!\"\\nIgnorance upon ignorance indeed!\"\\n  The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they wereaddressed to him; he knew  not that there were others who wereequally ignorant.\"\\nNot even a leaf of the plant  could be found.\"\\nTherewas one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew  anythingabout it.\"\\n Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot inthe wood.\"\\n\"Here is where  the plant stood,\" he said; \"it is a sacredplace.\"\\n Then he ordered that the place should  be surrounded with agolden railing, and a sentry stationed near it.\"\\n The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenlyplant, and for this  he was loaded with gold, which improved theposition of himself and his family.\"\\n And this part is really the most pleasant part of the story.\"\\nForthe plant had  disappeared, and the king remained as melancholy and sadas ever, but the sentry said  he had always been so.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A ROSE FROM HOMER\\'S GRAVE  by Hans Christian Andersen  ALL the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale forthe rose in the  silent starlight night.\"\\nThe winged songsterserenades the fragrant flowers.\"\\n Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loadedcamels, proudly arching their  long necks as they journey beneath thelofty pines over holy ground, I saw a hedge  of roses.\"\\nTheturtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees, and as thesunbeams  fell upon her wings, they glistened as if they weremother-of-pearl.\"\\nOn the rose-bush  grew a flower, more beautiful thanthem all, and to her the nightingale sung of his  woes; but the roseremained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy  on herleaves.\"\\nAt last she bowed her head over a heap of stones, and said,\"Here rests  the greatest singer in the world; over his tomb will Ispread my fragrance, and on  it I will let my leaves fall when thestorm scatters them.\"\\nHe who sung of Troy became  earth, and from thatearth I have sprung.\"\\nI, a rose from the grave of Homer, am too  loftyto bloom for a nightingale.\"\\n Then the nightingale sung himself todeath.\"\\nA  camel-driver came by, with his loaded camels and his blackslaves; his little son found  the dead bird, and buried the lovelysongster in the grave of the great Homer, while  the rose trembled inthe wind.\"\\n The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more closelyround her, and dreamed:  and this was her dream.\"\\n It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near who hadundertaken a  pilgrimage to the grave of Homer.\"\\nAmong the strangers wasa minstrel from the north,  the home of the clouds and the brilliantlights of the aurora borealis.\"\\nHe plucked  the rose and placed it ina book, and carried it away into a distant part of the world,  hisfatherland.\"\\nThe rose faded with grief, and lay between the leaves ofthe book, which  he opened in his own home, saying, \"Here is a rosefrom the grave of Homer.\"\\n  Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the wind.A drop of dew fell  from the leaves upon the singer\\'s grave.\"\\nThe sunrose, and the flower bloomed more  beautiful than ever.\"\\nThe day washot, and she was still in her own warm Asia.\"\\nThen  footstepsapproached, strangers, such as the rose had seen in her dream, cameby, and  among them was a poet from the north; he plucked the rose,pressed a kiss upon her  fresh mouth, and carried her away to thehome of the clouds and the northern lights.\"\\n Like a mummy, the flowernow rests in his \"Iliad,\" and, as in her dream, she hears  him say,as he opens the book, \"Here is a rose from the grave of Homer.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A STORY  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the garden all the apple-trees were in blossom.\"\\nThey hadhastened to bring forth  flowers before they got green leaves, and inthe yard all the ducklings walked up and  down, and the cat too: itbasked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own paws.\"\\n Andwhen one looked at the fields, how beautifully the corn stood andhow green it shone,  without comparison!\"\\nand there was a twittering anda fluttering of all the little birds,  as if the day were a greatfestival; and so it was, for it was Sunday.\"\\nAll the bells  wereringing, and all the people went to church, looking cheerful, anddressed in their  best clothes.\"\\nThere was a look of cheerfulness oneverything.\"\\nThe day was so warm and  beautiful that one might well havesaid: \"God\\'s kindness to us men is beyond all  limits.\"\\n But insidethe church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly  andangrily.\"\\nHe said that all men were wicked, and God would punish themfor their sins,  and that the wicked, when they died, would be castinto hell, to burn for ever and  ever.\"\\nHe spoke very excitedly,saying that their evil propensities would not be  destroyed, norwould the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.That  was terrible to hear, and he said it in such a tone ofconviction; he described hell  to them as a miserable hole where allthe refuse of the world gathers.\"\\nThere was no  air beside the hotburning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet;  they,the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silencesurrounded them!\"\\n It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacherspoke from his heart, and all the  people in the church were terrified.Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and  the sun was shiningso beautifully warm, it seemed as though every little flower  said:\"God, Thy kindness towards us all is without limits.\"\\n Indeed,outside it was not  at all like the pastor\\'s sermon.\"\\n The same evening, upon going to bed, the pastor noticed his wifesitting there quiet  and pensive.\"\\n \"What is the matter with you?\"\\n he asked her.\"\\n \"Well, the matter with me is,\" she said, \"that I cannot collect mythoughts, and am  unable to grasp the meaning of what you said to-dayin church- that there are so many  wicked people, and that theyshould burn eternally.\"\\nAlas!\"\\neternally- how long!\"\\nI am  only a womanand a sinner before God, but I should not have the heart to let eventhe  worst sinner burn for ever, and how could our Lord to do so, whois so infinitely good,  and who knows how the wickedness comes fromwithout and within?\"\\nNo, I am unable to  imagine that, although yousay so.\"\\n  It was autumn; the trees dropped their leaves, the earnest andsevere pastor sat at  the bedside of a dying person.\"\\nA pious,faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she  was the pastor\\'s wife.\"\\n ...\"\\nIf any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before ourLord you shall  certainly do so,\" said the pastor.\"\\nHe folded herhands and read a psalm over the dead  woman.\"\\n She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of theearnest man, and in the  parsonage it was empty and still, for itssun had set for ever.\"\\nShe had gone home.\"\\n It was night.\"\\nA cold wind swept over the pastor\\'s head; heopened his eyes, and it  seemed to him as if the moon was shininginto his room.\"\\nIt was not so, however; there  was a being standingbefore his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife.\"\\n Shefixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression, just asif she wished  to say something to him.\"\\nThe pastor raised himself inbed and stretched his arms towards  her, saying, \"Not even you can findeternal rest!\"\\nYou suffer, you best and most pious  woman?\"\\n  The dead woman nodded her head as if to say \"Yes,\" and put herhand on her breast.\"\\n \"And can I not obtain rest in the grave for you?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" was the answer.\"\\n \"And how?\"\\n  \"Give me one hair- only one single hair- from the head of thesinner for whom the fire  shall never be extinguished, of the sinnerwhom God will condemn to eternal punishment  in hell.\"\\n  \"Yes, one ought to be able to redeem you so easily, you pure,pious woman,\" he said.\"\\n \"Follow me,\" said the dead woman.\"\\n\"It is thus granted to us.\"\\nBy myside you will be  able to fly wherever your thoughts wish to go.Invisible to men, we shall penetrate  into their most secretchambers; but with sure hand you must find out him who is  destinedto eternal torture, and before the cock crows he must be found!\"\\n Asquickly  as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the greatcity, and from the walls  the names of the deadly sins shone in flamingletters: pride, avarice, drunkenness,  wantonness- in short, thewhole seven-coloured bow of sin.\"\\n \"Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it,\" said the pastor, \"areliving those who  are abandoned to the eternal fire.\"\\n And they werestanding before the magnificently  illuminated gate; the broad stepswere adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance  music was soundingthrough the festive halls.\"\\nA footman dressed in silk and velvetstood  with a large silver-mounted rod near the entrance.\"\\n \"Our ball can compare favourably with the king\\'s,\" he said, andturned with contempt  towards the gazing crowd in the street.\"\\nWhat hethought was sufficiently expressed  in his features and movements:\"Miserable beggars, who are looking in, you are nothing  incomparison to me.\"\\n  \"Pride,\" said the dead woman; \"do you see him?\"\\n  \"The footman?\"\\n asked the pastor.\"\\n\"He is but a poor fool, and notdoomed to be tortured  eternally by fire!\"\\n  \"Only a fool!\"\\n It sounded through the whole house of pride: theywere all fools there.\"\\n Then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser.\"\\nLean as askeleton, trembling  with cold, and hunger, the old man was clingingwith all his thoughts to his money.\"\\n They saw him jump up feverishlyfrom his miserable couch and take a loose stone out  of the wall; therelay gold coins in an old stocking.\"\\nThey saw him anxiously feeling  overan old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn, and his clammyfingers  trembled.\"\\n \"He is ill!\"\\nThat is madness- a joyless madness- besieged by fearand dreadful dreams!\"\\n  They quickly went away and came before the beds of thecriminals; these unfortunate  people slept side by side, in longrows.\"\\nLike a ferocious animal, one of them rose  out of his sleep anduttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in  the ribswith his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his sleep:  \"Be quiet, monster- sleep!\"\\nThis happens every night!\"\\n  \"Every night!\"\\n repeated the other.\"\\n\"Yes, every night he comesand tortures me!\"\\nIn my  violence I have done this and that.\"\\nI wasborn with an evil mind, which has brought  me hither for the secondtime; but if I have done wrong I suffer punishment for it.\"\\n Onething, however, I have not yet confessed.\"\\nWhen I came out a littlewhile ago, and  passed by the yard of my former master, evil thoughtsrose within me when I remembered  this and that.\"\\nI struck a match alittle bit on the wall; probably it came a little  too close to thethatched roof.\"\\nAll burnt down- a great heat rose, such as  sometimesovercomes me.\"\\nI myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothingalive  burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, andthe yard dog, of which  I had not thought; one could hear him howlout of the fire, and this howling I still  hear when I wish to sleep;and when I have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes  and placeshimself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me.\"\\nNow listen towhat  I tell you!\"\\nYou can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and Ihardly a quarter  of an hour!\"\\n And the blood rose to the head of theexcited criminal; he threw himself  upon his comrade, and beat him withhis clenced fist in the face.\"\\n \"Wicked Matz has become mad again!\"\\n they said amongstthemselves.\"\\nThe other criminals  seized him, wrestled with him, andbent him double, so that his head rested between  his knees, and theytied him, so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out  of allhis pores.\"\\n \"You are killing the unfortunate man,\" said the pastor, and ashe stretched out his  hand to protect him who already suffered toomuch, the scene changed.\"\\nThey flew through  rich halls and wretchedhovels; wantonness and envy, all the deadly sins, passed  beforethem.\"\\nAn angel of justice read their crimes and their defence; thelatter was  not a brilliant one, but it was read before God, Whoreads the heart, Who knows  everything, the wickedness that comesfrom within and from without, Who is mercy and  love personified.\"\\nThepastor\\'s hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did  notventure to pull a hair out of the sinner\\'s head.\"\\nAnd tears gushed fromhis eyes  like a stream of mercy and love, the cooling waters ofwhich extinguished the eternal  fire of hell.\"\\n Just then the cock crowed.\"\\n \"Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I wasunable to procure for  her!\"\\n  \"I have it now!\"\\n said the dead woman.\"\\n\"It was your hard words,your despair of mankind,  your gloomy belief in God and His creation,which drove me to you.\"\\nLearn to know mankind!\"\\n Even in the wicked onelives a part of God- and this extinguishes and conquers the  flame ofhell!\"\\n  The pastor felt a kiss on his lips; a gleam of light surroundedhim- God\\'s bright sun  shone into the room, and his wife, alive,sweet and full of love, awoke him from a  dream which God had sent him!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS  by Hans Christian Andersen  THIS story is from the sand-dunes or sand-hills of Jutland, but itdoes not begin there  in the North, but far away in the South, inSpain.\"\\nThe wide sea is the highroad from  nation to nation; journeyin thought; then, to sunny Spain.\"\\nIt is warm and beautiful  there;the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels; a coolrefreshing  breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens,over the Moorish halls with  their golden cupolas and coloured walls.Children go through the streets in procession  with candles andwaving banners, and the sky, lofty and clear with its glitteringstars,  rises above them.\"\\nSounds of singing and castanets can be heard,and youths and maidens  dance upon the flowering acacia trees, whileeven the beggar sits upon a block of marble,  refreshing himself with ajuicy melon, and dreamily enjoying life.\"\\nIt all seems like  a beautifuldream.\"\\n Here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselvesup to the charm of  life; indeed they possessed every good thing theycould desire- health and happiness,  riches and honour.\"\\n We are as happy as human beings can be,\" said the young couplefrom the depths of their  hearts.\"\\nThey had indeed only one stephigher to mount on the ladder of happiness- they  hoped that Godwould give them a child, a son like them in form and spirit.\"\\nThe  happylittle one was to be welcomed with rejoicing, to be cared for withlove and  tenderness, and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxurythat a rich and influential  family can give.\"\\nSo the days went bylike a joyous festival.\"\\n \"Life is a gracious gift from God, almost too great a gift forus to appreciate!\"\\n said  the young wife.\"\\n\"Yet they say that fulnessof joy for ever and ever can only be found  in the future life.\"\\nIcannot realise it!\"\\n  \"The thought arises, perhaps, from the arrogance of men,\" said thehusband.\"\\n\"It seems  a great pride to believe that we shall live forever, that we shall be as gods!\"\\nWere  not these the words of theserpent, the father of lies?\"\\n  \"Surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life?\"\\nexclaimed the young wife.\"\\n It seemed as if one of the first shadowspassed over her sunny thoughts.\"\\n \"Faith realises it, and the priests tell us so,\" replied herhusband; \"but amid all  my happiness I feel that it is arrogant todemand a continuation of it- another life  after this.\"\\nHas not somuch been given us in this world that we ought to be, we must  be,contented with it?\"\\n  \"Yes, it has been given to us,\" said the young wife, \"but thislife is nothing more  than one long scene of trial and hardship to manythousands.\"\\nHow many have been cast  into this world only to endurepoverty, shame, illness, and misfortune?\"\\nIf there were  no future life,everything here would be too unequally divided, and God would not bethe  personification of justice.\"\\n  \"The beggar there,\" said her husband, \"has joys of his own whichseem to him great,  and cause him as much pleasure as a king would findin the magnificence of his palace.\"\\n And then do you not think thatthe beast of burden, which suffers blows and hunger,  and worksitself to death, suffers just as much from its miserable fate?\"\\nThedumb  creature might demand a future life also, and declare the lawunjust that excludes  it from the advantages of the higher creation.\"\\n  \"Christ said: \\'In my father\\'s house are many mansions,\\'\" sheanswered.\"\\n\"Heaven is as  boundless as the love of our Creator; the dumbanimal is also His creature, and I firmly  believe that no life will belost, but each will receive as much happiness as he can  enjoy, whichwill be sufficient for him.\"\\n  \"This world is sufficient for me,\" said the husband, throwinghis arm round his  beautiful, sweet-tempered wife.\"\\nHe sat by her sideon the open balcony, smoking a  cigarette in the cool air, which wasloaded with the sweet scent of carnations and  orange blossoms.Sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the roadbeneath,  the stars shone above then, and two eyes full of affection-those of his wife- looked  upon him with the expression of undyinglove.\"\\n\"Such a moment,\" he said, \"makes it worth  while to be born, todie, and to be annihilated!\"\\n He smiled- the young wife raised  her handin gentle reproof, and the shadow passed away from her mind, andthey were  happy- quite happy.\"\\n Everything seemed to work together for their good.\"\\nThey advancedin honour, in  prosperity, and in happiness.\"\\nA change came certainly,but it was only a change of  place and not of circumstances.\"\\n The young man was sent by his Sovereign as ambassador to theRussian Court.\"\\nThis was  an office of high dignity, but his birth andhis acquirements entitled him to the honour.\"\\n He possessed a largefortune, and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own,  for shewas the daughter of a rich and respected merchant.\"\\nOne of thismerchant\\'s  largest and finest ships was to be sent that year toStockholm, and it was arranged  that the dear young couple, thedaughter and the son-in-law, should travel in it to  St.\"\\nPetersburg.All the arrangements on board were princely and silk and luxury onevery  side.\"\\n In an old war song, called \"The King of England\\'s Son,\" it says:  \"Farewell, he said, and sailed away.\"\\n And many recollect that day.\"\\n The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,  And everywhere riches and wealth untold.\"\\n  These words would aptly describe the vessel from Spain, for herewas the same luxury,  and the same parting thought naturally arose:  \"God grant that we once more may meet  In sweet unclouded peace and joy.\"\\n  There was a favourable wind blowing as they left the Spanishcoast, and it would be  but a short journey, for they hoped to reachtheir destination in a few weeks; but  when they came out upon the wideocean the wind dropped, the sea became smooth and  shining, and thestars shone brightly.\"\\nMany festive evenings were spent on board.\"\\n Atlast the travellers began to wish for wind, for a favourable breeze;but their wish  was useless- not a breath of air stirred, or if itdid arise it was contrary.\"\\nWeeks  passed by in this way, two wholemonths, and then at length a fair wind blew from the  south-west.\"\\nTheship sailed on the high seas between Scotland and Jutland; then thewind  increased, just as it did in the old song of \"The King ofEngland\\'s Son.\"\\n  \"\\'Mid storm and wind, and pelting hail,  Their efforts were of no avail.\"\\n The golden anchor forth they threw;  Towards Denmark the west wind blew.\"\\n  This all happened a long time ago; King Christian VII, who saton the Danish throne,  was still a young man.\"\\nMuch has happened sincethen, much has altered or been changed.\"\\n Sea and moorland have beenturned into green meadows, stretches of heather have become  arableland, and in the shelter of the peasant\\'s cottages, apple-trees androse-bushes  grow, though they certainly require much care, as thesharp west wind blows upon them.\"\\n In West Jutland one may go back inthought to old times, farther back than the days  when Christian VIIruled.\"\\nThe purple heather still extends for miles, with its  barrowsand aerial spectacles, intersected with sandy uneven roads, just as itdid then;  towards the west, where broad streams run into the bays, aremarshes and meadows  encircled by lofty, sandy hills, which, like achain of Alps, raise their pointed  summits near the sea; they are onlybroken by high ridges of clay, from which the sea,  year by year, bitesout great mouthfuls, so that the overhanging banks fall down as  ifby the shock of an earthquake.\"\\nThus it is there today and thus itwas long ago, when  the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful ship.\"\\n It was a Sunday, towards the end of September; the sun wasshining, and the chiming  of the church bells in the Bay of Nissumwas carried along by the breeze like a chain  of sounds.\"\\nThe churchesthere are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone, each  like apiece of rock.\"\\nThe North Sea might foam over them and they would notbe disturbed.\"\\n Nearly all of them are without steeples, and the bellsare hung outside between two  beams.\"\\nThe service was over, and thecongregation passed out into the churchyard, where  not a tree orbush was to be seen; no flowers were planted there, and they had notplaced  a single wreath upon any of the graves.\"\\nIt is just the samenow.\"\\nRough mounds show  where the dead have been buried, and rankgrass, tossed by the wind, grows thickly  over the whole churchyard;here and there a grave has a sort of monument, a block of  half-decayedwood, rudely cut in the shape of a coffin; the blocks are brought fromthe  forest of West Jutland, but the forest is the sea itself, andthe inhabitants find  beams, and planks, and fragments which thewaves have cast upon the beach.\"\\nOne of these  blocks had been placed byloving hands on a child\\'s grave, and one of the women who  had come outof the church walked up to it; she stood there, her eyes resting onthe  weather-beaten memorial, and a few moments afterwards herhusband joined her.\"\\nThey  were both silent, but he took her hand, andthey walked together across the purple  heath, over moor and meadowtowards the sandhills.\"\\nFor a long time they went on without  speaking.\"\\n \"It was a good sermon to-day,\" the man said at last.\"\\n\"If we hadnot God to trust in,  we should have nothing.\"\\n  \"Yes,\" replied the woman, \"He sends joy and sorrow, and He has aright to send them.\"\\n To-morrow our little son would have been fiveyears old if we had been permitted to  keep him.\"\\n  \"It is no use fretting, wife,\" said the man.\"\\n\"The boy is wellprovided for.\"\\nHe is where  we hope and pray to go to.\"\\n  They said nothing more, but went out towards their houses amongthe sand-hills.\"\\nAll  at once, in front of one of the houses where thesea grass did not keep the sand down  with its twining roots, whatseemed to be a column of smoke rose up.\"\\nA gust of wind  rushedbetween the hills, hurling the particles of sand high into the air;another gust,  and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped andbeat violently against the walls  of the cottage; then everything wasquiet once more, and the sun shone with renewed  heat.\"\\n The man and his wife went into the cottage.\"\\nThey had soon takenoff their Sunday clothes  and come out again, hurrying over the duneswhich stood there like great waves of sand  suddenly arrested intheir course, while the sandweeds and dune grass with its  bluishstalks spread a changing colour over them.\"\\nA few neighbours alsocame out, and  helped each other to draw the boats higher up on thebeach.\"\\nThe wind now blew more  keenly, it was chilly and cold, and whenthey went back over the sand-hills, sand and  little sharp stonesblew into their faces.\"\\nThe waves rose high, crested with white  foam,and the wind cut off their crests, scattering the foam far and wide.\"\\n Evening came; there was a swelling roar in the air, a wailing ormoaning like the voices  of despairing spirits, that sounded abovethe thunder of the waves.\"\\nThe fisherman\\'s  little cottage was on thevery margin, and the sand rattled against the window panes;  everynow and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation.It was  dark, but about midnight the moon would rise.\"\\nLater on theair became clearer, but  the storm swept over the perturbed sea withundiminished fury; the fisher folks had  long since gone to bed, but insuch weather there was no chance of closing an eye.\"\\n Presently therewas a tapping at the window; the door was opened, and a voice said:  \"There\\'s a large ship stranded on the farthest reef.\"\\n  In a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastilydressed themselves.\"\\n The moon had risen, and it was light enough tomake the surrounding objects visible  to those who could open theireyes in the blinding clouds of sand; the violence of  the wind wasterrible, and it was only possible to pass among the sand-hills if onecrept  forward between the gusts; the salt spray flew up from the sealike down, and the ocean  foamed like a roaring cataract towards thebeach.\"\\nOnly a practised eye could discern  the vessel out in theoffing; she was a fine brig, and the waves now lifted her over  thereef, three or four cables\\' length out of the usual channel.\"\\nShe drovetowards the  shore, struck on the second reef, and remained fixed.\"\\n It was impossible to render assistance; the sea rushed in upon thevessel, making a  clean breach over her.\"\\nThose on shore thought theyheard cries for help from those  on board, and could plainlydistinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the  stranded sailors.Now a wave came rolling onward.\"\\nIt fell with enormous force on  thebowsprit, tearing it from the vessel, and the stern was lifted highabove the water.\"\\n Two people were seen to embrace and plunge togetherinto the sea, and the next moment  one of the largest waves that rolledtowards the sand-hills threw a body on the beach.\"\\n It was a woman;the sailors said that she was quite dead, but the women thought theysaw  signs of life in her, so the stranger was carried across thesand-hills to the  fisherman\\'s cottage.\"\\nHow beautiful and fair she was!She must be a great lady, they  said.\"\\n They laid her upon the humble bed; there was not a yard of linenon it, only a woollen  coverlet to keep the occupant warm.\"\\n Life returned to her, but she was delirious, and knew nothing ofwhat had happened  or where she was; and it was better so, foreverything she loved and valued lay buried  in the sea.\"\\nThe samething happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song  about\"The King of England\\'s Son.\"\\n  \"Alas!\"\\nhow terrible to see  The gallant bark sink rapidly.\"\\n  Fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore; theywere all that  remained of the vessel.\"\\nThe wind still blew violently onthe coast.\"\\n For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest; but she awokein pain, and uttered  cries of anguish and fear.\"\\nShe opened herwonderfully beautiful eyes, and spoke a few  words, but nobodyunderstood her.- And lo!\"\\nas a reward for the sorrow and sufferingshe  had undergone, she held in her arms a new-born babe.\"\\nThe childthat was to have rested  upon a magnificent couch, draped with silkencurtains, in a luxurious home; it was  to have been welcomed with joyto a life rich in all the good things of this world;  and now Heavenhad ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat, that itshould  not even receive a kiss from its mother, for when thefisherman\\'s wife laid the child  upon the mother\\'s bosom, it restedon a heart that beat no more- she was dead.\"\\n The child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxurywas cast into the world,  washed by the sea among the sand-hills toshare the fate and hardships of the poor.\"\\n Here we are reminded again of the song about \"The King ofEngland\\'s Son,\" for in it  mention is made of the custom prevalent atthe time, when knights and squires plundered  those who had beensaved from shipwreck.\"\\nThe ship had stranded some distance south  ofNissum Bay, and the cruel, inhuman days, when, as we have just said,the inhabitants  of Jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudelywere past, long ago.\"\\nAffectionate  sympathy and self-sacrifice forthe unfortunate existed then, just as it does in our  own time inmany a bright example.\"\\nThe dying mother and the unfortunate childwould  have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast bythe winds, but nowhere  would it have been more sincere than in thecottage of the poor fisherman\\'s wife, who  had stood, only the daybefore, beside her child\\'s grave, who would have been five  years oldthat day if God had spared it to her.\"\\n No one knew who the dead stranger was, they could not even forma conjecture; the  fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter.\"\\n No tidings reached Spain of the fate of the daughter andson-in-law.\"\\nThey did not arrive  at their destination, and violentstorms had raged during the past weeks.\"\\nAt last the  verdict was given:\"Foundered at sea- all lost.\"\\n But in the fisherman\\'s cottage among  thesand-hills near Hunsby, there lived a little scion of the rich Spanishfamily.\"\\n Where Heaven sends food for two, a third can manage to find ameal, and in the depth  of the sea there is many a dish of fish for thehungry.\"\\n They called the boy Jurgen.\"\\n \"It must certainly be a Jewish child, its skin is so dark,\" thepeople said.\"\\n \"It might be an Italian or a Spaniard,\" remarked the clergyman.\"\\n But to the fisherman\\'s wife these nations seemed all the same, andshe consoled herself  with the thought that the child was baptized as aChristian.\"\\n The boy throve; the noble blood in his veins was warm, and hebecame strong on his  homely fare.\"\\nHe grew apace in the humble cottage,and the Danish dialect spoken by  the West Jutes became his language.The pomegranate seed from Spain became a hardy  plant on the coast ofWest Jutland.\"\\nThus may circumstances alter the course of a man\\'s  life!To this home he clung with deep-rooted affection; he was to experiencecold and  hunger, and the misfortunes and hardships that surround thepoor; but he also tasted  of their joys.\"\\n Childhood has bright days for every one, and the memory of themshines through the  whole after-life.\"\\nThe boy had many sources ofpleasure and enjoyment; the coast for  miles and miles was full ofplaythings, for it was a mosaic of pebbles, some red as  coral oryellow as amber, and others again white and rounded like birds\\' eggsand  smoothed and prepared by the sea.\"\\nEven the bleached fishes\\'skeletons, the water plants  dried by the wind, and seaweed, whiteand shining long linen-like bands waving between  the stones- all theseseemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the boy\\'s  thoughts,and he had an intelligent mind; many great talents lay dormant in him.How  readily he remembered stories and songs that he heard, and howdexterous he was with  his fingers!\"\\nWith stones and mussel-shells hecould put together pictures and ships  with which one could decoratethe room; and he could make wonderful things from a stick,  hisfoster-mother said, although he was still so young and little.\"\\nHehad a sweet voice,  and every melody seemed to flow naturally fromhis lips.\"\\nAnd in his heart were hidden  chords, which might havesounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhere  elsethan in the fisherman\\'s hut by the North Sea.\"\\n One day another ship was wrecked on the coast, and among otherthings a chest filled  with valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore.Some were put into saucepans and cooked,  for they were thought to befit to eat, and others lay and shrivelled in the sand\\ufffethey did notaccomplish their purpose, or unfold their magnificent colours.\"\\n WouldJurgen fare better?\"\\nThe flower bulbs had soon played their part, buthe had years  of apprenticeship before him.\"\\nNeither he nor hisfriends noticed in what a monotonous,  uniform way one day followedanother, for there was always plenty to do and see.\"\\nThe  ocean itselfwas a great lesson-book, and it unfolded a new leaf each day of calmor  storm- the crested wave or the smooth surface.\"\\n The visits to the church were festive occasions, but among thefisherman\\'s house one  was especially looked forward to; this was, infact, the visit of the brother of  Jurgen\\'s foster-mother, theeel-breeder from Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg.\"\\nHe came twice  a year in acart, painted red with blue and white tulips upon it, and full ofeels;  it was covered and locked like a box, two dun oxen drew it,and Jurgen was allowed  to guide them.\"\\n The eel-breeder was a witty fellow, a merry guest, and brought ameasure of brandy  with him.\"\\nThey all received a small glassful or acupful if there were not enough  glasses; even Jurgen had about athimbleful, that he might digest the fat eel, as the  eel-breeder said;he always told one story over and over again, and if his  hearerslaughed he would immediately repeat it to them.\"\\nJurgen while still aboy, and  also when he was older, used phrases from the eel-breeder\\'sstory on various occasions,  so it will be as well for us to listento it.\"\\nIt runs thus:  \"The eels went into the bay, and the young ones begged leave to goa little farther  out.\"\\n\\'Don\\'t go too far,\\' said their mother; \\'the uglyeel-spearer might come and snap  you all up.\\' But they went too far,and of eight daughters only three came back to  the mother, and thesewept and said, \\'We only went a little way out, and the  uglyeel-spearer came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters todeath.\\' \\'They\\'ll  come back again,\\' said the mother eel.\"\\n\\'Oh, no,\\'exclaimed the daughters, \\'for he  skinned them, cut them in two, andfried them.\\' \\'Oh, they\\'ll come back again,\\' the  mother eelpersisted.\"\\n\\'No,\\' replied the daughters, \\'for he ate them up.\\' \\'They\\'llcome  back again,\\' repeated the mother eel.\"\\n\\'But he drank brandyafter them,\\' said the  daughters.\"\\n\\'Ah, then they\\'ll never come back,\\'said the mother, and she burst out  crying, \\'it\\'s the brandy thatburies the eels.\\'\"  \"And therefore,\" said the eel-breeder in conclusion, \"it is alwaysthe proper thing  to drink brandy after eating eels.\"\\n  This story was the tinsel thread, the most humorous recollectionof Jurgen\\'s life.\"\\n He also wanted to go a little way farther out and upthe bay- that is to say, out into  the world in a ship- but hismother said, like the eel-breeder, \"There are so many  bad people-eel spearers!\"\\n He wished to go a little way past the sand-hills, outinto  the dunes, and at last he did: four happy days, the brightestof his childhood, fell  to his lot, and the whole beauty andsplendour of Jutland, all the happiness and  sunshine of his home, wereconcentrated in these.\"\\nHe went to a festival, but it was  a burialfeast.\"\\n A rich relation of the fisherman\\'s family had died; the farm wassituated far eastward  in the country and a little towards the north.Jurgen\\'s foster parents went there,  and he also went with them fromthe dunes, over heath and moor, where the Skjaerumaa  takes itscourse through green meadows and contains many eels; mother eelslive there  with their daughters, who are caught and eaten up by wickedpeople.\"\\nBut do not men  sometimes act quite as cruelly towards theirown fellow-men?\"\\nWas not the knight Sir  Bugge murdered by wickedpeople?\"\\nAnd though he was well spoken of, did he not also  wish to killthe architect who built the castle for him, with its thick walls andtower,  at the point where the Skjaerumaa falls into the bay?\"\\nJurgenand his parents now stood  there; the wall and the ramparts stillremained, and red crumbling fragments lay  scattered around.\"\\nHere itwas that Sir Bugge, after the architect had left him, said  to one ofhis men, \"Go after him and say, \\'Master, the tower shakes.\\' If heturns round,  kill him and take away the money I paid him, but if hedoes not turn round let him  go in peace.\"\\n The man did as he wastold; the architect did not turn round, but called  back \"The towerdoes not shake in the least, but one day a man will come from the westin  a blue cloak- he will cause it to shake!\"\\n And so indeed it happeneda hundred years  later, for the North Sea broke in and cast down thetower; but Predbjorn Gyldenstjerne,  the man who then possessed thecastle, built a new castle higher up at the end of the  meadow, andthat one is standing to this day, and is called Norre-Vosborg.\"\\n Jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle.\"\\nThey had toldhim its story during  the long winter evenings, and now he saw thestately edifice, with its double moat,  and trees and bushes; the wall,covered with ferns, rose within the moat, but the lofty  lime-treeswere the most beautiful of all; they grew up to the highest windows,and  the air was full of their sweet fragrance.\"\\nIn a north-westcorner of the garden stood  a great bush full of blossom, like wintersnow amid the summer\\'s green; it was a juniper  bush, the first thatJurgen had ever seen in bloom.\"\\nHe never forgot it, nor the  lime-trees;the child\\'s soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragranceto  gladden the old man.\"\\n From Norre-Vosborg, where the juniper blossomed, the journeybecame more pleasant,  for they met some other people who were alsogoing to the funeral and were riding in  waggons.\"\\nOur travellers had tosit all together on a little box at the back of the  waggon, but eventhis, they thought, was better than walking.\"\\nSo they continued  theirjourney across the rugged heath.\"\\nThe oxen which drew the waggonstopped every  now and then, where a patch of fresh grass appeared amidthe heather.\"\\nThe sun shone  with considerable heat, and it waswonderful to behold how in the far distance  something like smokeseemed to be rising; yet this smoke was clearer than the air;  it wastransparent, and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afarover the  heath.\"\\n \"That is Lokeman driving his sheep,\" said some one.\"\\n And this was enough to excite Jurgen\\'s imagination.\"\\nHe felt asif they were now about  to enter fairyland, though everything was stillreal.\"\\nHow quiet it was!\"\\nThe heath  stretched far and wide around themlike a beautiful carpet.\"\\nThe heather was in blossom,  and thejuniper-bushes and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from theearth.\"\\nAn  inviting place for a frolic, if it had not been for thenumber of poisonous adders  of which the travellers spoke; they alsomentioned that the place had formerly been  infested with wolves, andthat the district was still called Wolfsborg for this reason.\"\\n Theold man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime of hisfather the  horses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts thatwere now exterminated.\"\\nOne  morning, when he himself had gone out tobring in the horses, he found one of them  standing with its forefeeton a wolf it had killed, but the savage animal had torn  andlacerated the brave horse\\'s legs.\"\\n The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only tooquickly at an end.\"\\nThey stopped  before the house of mourning, wherethey found plenty of guests within and without.\"\\n Waggon after waggonstood side by side, while the horses and oxen had been turned out  tograze on the scanty pasture.\"\\nGreat sand-hills like those at home bythe North Sea  rose behind the house and extended far and wide.\"\\nHow hadthey come here, so many miles  inland?\"\\nThey were as large and high asthose on the coast, and the wind had carried  them there; there wasalso a legend attached to them.\"\\n Psalms were sung, and a few of the old people shed tears; withthis exception, the  guests were cheerful enough, it seemed toJurgen, and there was plenty to eat and drink.\"\\n There were eels ofthe fattest, requiring brandy to bury them, as the eel-breeder  said;and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here.\"\\n Jurgen went in and out the house; and on the third day he feltas much at home as he  did in the fisherman\\'s cottage among thesand-hills, where he had passed his early  days.\"\\nHere on the heath wereriches unknown to him until now; for flowers, blackberries,  andbilberries were to be found in profusion, so large and sweet that whenthey were  crushed beneath the tread of passers-by the heather wasstained with their red juice.\"\\n Here was a barrow and yonder another.Then columns of smoke rose into the still air;  it was a heath fire,they told him- how brightly it blazed in the dark evening!\"\\n The fourth day came, and the funeral festivities were at an end;they were to go back  from the land-dunes to the sand-dunes.\"\\n \"Ours are better,\" said the old fisherman, Jurgen\\'s foster-father;\"these have no  strength.\"\\n  And they spoke of the way in which the sand-dunes had come inland,and it seemed very  easy to understand.\"\\nThis is how they explained it:  A dead body had been found on the coast, and the peasants buriedit in the churchyard.\"\\n From that time the sand began to fly about andthe sea broke in with violence.\"\\nA wise  man in the district advisedthem to open the grave and see if the buried man was not  lying suckinghis thumb, for if so he must be a sailor, and the sea would not restuntil  it had got him back.\"\\nThe grave was opened, and he really wasfound with his thumb in  his mouth.\"\\nSo they laid him upon a cart, andharnessed two oxen to it; and the oxen  ran off with the sailor overheath and moor to the ocean, as if they had been stung  by an adder.Then the sand ceased to fly inland, but the hills that had beenpiled up  still remained.\"\\n All this Jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory ofthe happiest days of  his childhood- the days of the burial feast.\"\\n How delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix withstrangers!\"\\nAnd he was to  go still farther, for he was not yet fourteenyears old when he went out in a ship  to see the world.\"\\nHeencountered bad weather, heavy seas, unkindness, and hard men\\ufffesuchwere his experiences, for he became ship-boy.\"\\nCold nights, bad living,and blows  had to be endured; then he felt his noble Spanish blood boilwithin him, and bitter,  angry, words rose to his lips, but he gulpedthem down; it was better, although he  felt as the eel must feel whenit is skinned, cut up, and put into the frying-pan.\"\\n \"I shall get over it,\" said a voice within him.\"\\n He saw the Spanish coast, the native land of his parents.\"\\nHeeven saw the town where  they had lived in joy and prosperity, but heknew nothing of his home or his relations,  and his relations knew justas little about him.\"\\n The poor ship boy was not permitted to land, but on the last dayof their stay he managed  to get ashore.\"\\nThere were several purchasesto be made, and he was sent to carry them  on board.\"\\n Jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if theyhad been washed in  the ditch and dried in the chimney; he, who hadalways dwelt among the sand-hills,  now saw a great city for thefirst time.\"\\nHow lofty the houses seemed, and what a number  of peoplethere were in the streets!\"\\nsome pushing this way, some that- a  perfectmaelstrom of citizens and peasants, monks and soldiers- the jinglingof bells  on the trappings of asses and mules, the chiming of churchbells, calling, shouting,  hammering and knocking- all going on atonce.\"\\nEvery trade was located in the basement  of the houses or inthe side thoroughfares; and the sun shone with such heat, and theair  was so close, that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles,cockchafers, bees and  flies, all humming and buzzing together.Jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which  way he went.\"\\nThen he sawjust in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral; the  lights weregleaming in the dark aisles, and the fragrance of incense was waftedtowards  him.\"\\nEven the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into thesanctuary.\"\\nJurgen followed  the sailor he was with into the church, andstood in the sacred edifice.\"\\nColoured  pictures gleamed from theirgolden background, and on the altar stood the figure of  the Virginwith the child Jesus, surrounded by lights and flowers; priests infestive  robes were chanting, and choir boys in dazzling attire swungsilver censers.\"\\nWhat  splendour and magnificence he saw there!\"\\nItstreamed in upon his soul and overpowered  him: the church and thefaith of his parents surrounded him, and touched a chord in  hisheart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears.\"\\n They went from the church to the market-place.\"\\nHere a quantityof provisions were given  him to carry.\"\\nThe way to the harbour waslong; and weary and overcome with various  emotions, he rested for afew moments before a splendid house, with marble pillars,  statues, andbroad steps.\"\\nHere he rested his burden against the wall.\"\\nThen a porterin  livery came out, lifted up a silver-headed cane, and drove himaway- him, the grandson  of that house.\"\\nBut no one knew that, and hejust as little as any one.\"\\nThen he went  on board again, and oncemore encountered rough words and blows, much work and little  sleep-such was his experience of life.\"\\nThey say it is good to suffer inone\\'s young  days, if age brings something to make up for it.\"\\n His period of service on board the ship came to an end, and thevessel lay once more  at Ringkjobing in Jutland.\"\\nHe came ashore, andwent home to the sand-dunes near Hunsby;  but his foster-mother haddied during his absence.\"\\n A hard winter followed this summer.\"\\nSnow-storms swept over landand sea, and there  was difficulty in getting from one place toanother.\"\\nHow unequally things are  distributed in this world!\"\\nHerethere was bitter cold and snow-storms, while in Spain  there wasburning sunshine and oppressive heat.\"\\nYet, when a clear frosty daycame, and  Jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the seatowards the land, across to  Norre-Vosborg, it seemed to him thatpeople could breathe more freely here; the summer  also in this part ofthe world was splendid.\"\\nIn imagination he saw the heath blossom  andbecome purple with rich juicy berries, and the elder-bushes andlime-trees at Norre  Vosborg in flower.\"\\nHe made up his mind to go thereagain.\"\\n Spring came, and the fishing began.\"\\nJurgen was now an activehelper in this, for he  had grown during the last year, and was quickat work.\"\\nHe was full of life, and knew  how to swim, to tread water,and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide.\"\\nThey often  warnedhim to beware of the sharks, which seize the best swimmer, draw himdown, and  devour him; but such was not to be Jurgen\\'s fate.\"\\n At a neighbour\\'s house in the dunes there was a boy namedMartin, with whom Jurgen  was on very friendly terms, and they bothtook service in the same ship to Norway,  and also went together toHolland.\"\\nThey never had a quarrel, but a person can be  easilyexcited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered, for he oftenshows it in  many ways; and this is just what Jurgen did one day whenthey fell out about the merest  trifle.\"\\nThey were sitting behind thecabin door, eating from a delft plate, which they  had placed betweenthem.\"\\nJurgen held his pocket-knife in his hand and raised it  towardsMartin, and at the same time became ashy pale, and his eyes had anugly look.\"\\n Martin only said, \"Ah!\"\\nah!\"\\nyou are one of that sort, areyou?\"\\nFond of using the knife!\"\\n  The words were scarcely spoken, when Jurgen\\'s hand sank down.\"\\nHedid not answer a  syllable, but went on eating, and afterwards returnedto his work.\"\\nWhen they were  resting again he walked up to Martin andsaid:  \"Hit me in the face!\"\\nI deserve it.\"\\nBut sometimes I feel as if Ihad a pot in me that  boils over.\"\\n  \"There, let the thing rest,\" replied Martin.\"\\n And after that they were almost better friends than ever; whenafterwards they returned  to the dunes and began telling theiradventures, this was told among the rest.\"\\nMartin  said that Jurgenwas certainly passionate, but a good fellow after all.\"\\n They were both young and healthy, well-grown and strong; butJurgen was the cleverer  of the two.\"\\n In Norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattlethere to find pasture.\"\\n On the west coast of Jutland huts have beenerected among the sand-hills; they are  built of pieces of wreck, andthatched with turf and heather; there are sleeping places  round thewalls, and here the fishermen live and sleep during the earlyspring.\"\\nEvery  fisherman has a female helper, or manager as she iscalled, who baits his hooks,  prepares warm beer for him when hecomes ashore, and gets the dinner cooked and ready  for him by the timehe comes back to the hut tired and hungry.\"\\nBesides this the  managersbring up the fish from the boats, cut them open, prepare them, andhave  generally a great deal to do.\"\\n Jurgen, his father, and several other fishermen and their managersinhabited the same  hut; Martin lived in the next one.\"\\n One of the girls, whose name was Else, had known Jurgen fromchildhood; they were glad  to see each other, and were of the sameopinion on many points, but in appearance they  were entirely opposite;for he was dark, and she was pale, and fair, and had flaxen  hair,and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine.\"\\n As they were walking together one day, Jurgen held her hand veryfirmly in his, and  she said to him: \"Jurgen, I have something I want to say to you; let me be yourmanager,  for you are like a brother to me; but Martin, whosehousekeeper I am- he is my lover\\ufffebut you need not tell this to theothers.\"\\n  It seemed to Jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way underhis feet.\"\\nHe did not  speak a word, but nodded his head, and that meant\"yes.\"\\n It was all that was necessary;  but he suddenly felt in hisheart that he hated Martin, and the more he thought the  more he feltconvinced that Martin had stolen away from him the only being heever loved,  and that this was Else: he had never thought of Else inthis way before, but now it  all became plain to him.\"\\n When the sea is rather rough, and the fishermen are coming home intheir great boats,  it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs.One of them stands upright in the  bow of the boat, and the otherswatch him sitting with the oars in their hands.\"\\nOutside  the reef itlooks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea;then  the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the greatwave is coming which  is to float them across the reef.\"\\nThe boat islifted high into the air, so that the  keel is seen from the shore; thenext moment nothing can be seen, mast, keel, and people  are allhidden- it seems as though the sea had devoured them; but in a fewmoments they  emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves, andthe oars move as if the  creature had legs.\"\\nThe second and third reefare passed in the same manner; then the  fishermen jump into thewater and push the boat towards the shore- every wave helps  them-and at length they have it drawn up, beyond the reach of the breakers.\"\\n A wrong order given in front of the reef- the slightesthesitation- and the boat would  be lost,  \"Then it would be all over with me and Martin too!\"\\n  This thought passed through Jurgen\\'s mind one day while theywere out at sea, where  his foster-father had been taken suddenlyill.\"\\nThe fever had seized him.\"\\nThey were  only a few oars\\' strokes fromthe reef, and Jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up  in the bow.\"\\n \"Father-let me come!\"\\n he said, and he glanced at Martin and acrossthe waves; every  oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as thegreat wave came towards them, and  he saw his father\\'s pale face, anddared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through  his brain.\"\\nTheboat came safely across the reef to land; but the evil thoughtremained  in his heart, and roused up every little fibre ofbitterness which he remembered  between himself and Martin since theyhad known each other.\"\\nBut he could not weave  the fibres together,nor did he endeavour to do so.\"\\nHe felt that Martin had robbed  him, andthis was enough to make him hate his former friend.\"\\nSeveral of thefishermen  saw this, but Martin did not- he remained as obliging andtalkative as ever, in fact  he talked rather too much.\"\\n Jurgen\\'s foster-father took to his bed, and it became hisdeath-bed, for he died a  week afterwards; and now Jurgen was heir tothe little house behind the sand-hills.\"\\n It was small, certainly, butstill it was something, and Martin had nothing of the  kind.\"\\n \"You will not go to sea again, Jurgen, I suppose,\" observed one ofthe old fishermen.\"\\n \"You will always stay with us now.\"\\n  But this was not Jurgen\\'s intention; he wanted to see something ofthe world.\"\\nThe  eel-breeder of Fjaltring had an uncle at Old Skjagen,who was a fisherman, but also  a prosperous merchant with ships uponthe sea; he was said to be a good old man, and  it would not be a badthing to enter his service.\"\\nOld Skjagen lies in the extreme north  ofJutland, as far away from the Hunsby dunes as one can travel in thatcountry; and  this is just what pleased Jurgen, for he did not wantto remain till the wedding of  Martin and Else, which would takeplace in a week or two.\"\\n The old fisherman said it was foolish to go away, for now thatJurgen had a home Else  would very likely be inclined to take himinstead of Martin.\"\\n Jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make outwhat he meant- the  old man brought Else to him, and she said:  \"You have a home now; you ought to think of that.\"\\n  And Jurgen thought of many things.\"\\n The sea has heavy waves, but there are heavier waves in thehuman heart.\"\\nMany thoughts,  strong and weak, rushed through Jurgen\\'sbrain, and he said to Else:  \"If Martin had a house like mine, which of us would you ratherhave?\"\\n  \"But Martin has no house and cannot get one.\"\\n  \"Suppose he had one?\"\\n  \"Well, then I would certainly take Martin, for that is what myheart tells me; but  one cannot live upon love.\"\\n  Jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night.\"\\nSomethingwas working within  him, he hardly knew what it was, but it was evenstronger than his love for Else; and  so he went to Martin\\'s, andwhat he said and did there was well considered.\"\\nHe let  the house toMartin on most liberal terms, saying that he wished to go to seaagain,  because he loved it.\"\\nAnd Else kissed him when she heard ofit, for she loved Martin  best.\"\\n Jurgen proposed to start early in the morning, and on theevening before his departure,  when it was already getting rather late,he felt a wish to visit Martin once more.\"\\n He started, and among thedunes met the old fisherman, who was angry at his leaving  the place.The old man made jokes about Martin, and declared there must be somemagic  about that fellow, of whom the girls were so fond.\"\\n Jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks, but said good-byeto the old man and  went on towards the house where Martin dwelt.\"\\nHeheard loud talking inside; Martin  was not alone, and this madeJurgen waver in his determination, for he did not wish  to see Elseagain.\"\\nOn second thoughts, he decided that it was better not to hearany  more thanks from Martin, and so he turned back.\"\\n On the following morning, before the sun rose, he fastened hisknapsack on his back,  took his wooden provision box in his hand, andwent away among the sand-hills towards  the coast path.\"\\nThis way wasmore pleasant than the heavy sand road, and besides it  was shorter;and he intended to go first to Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg, where  theeel-breeder lived, to whom he had promised a visit.\"\\n The sea lay before him, clear and blue, and the mussel shellsand pebbles, the  playthings of his childhood, crunched over hisfeet.\"\\nWhile he thus walked on his nose  suddenly began to bleed; it wasa trifling occurrence, but trifles sometimes are of  greatimportance.\"\\nA few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves.He wiped  them off and stopped the bleeding, and it seemed to him as ifthis had cleared and  lightened his brain.\"\\nThe sea-cale bloomed hereand there in the sand as he passed.\"\\n He broke off a spray and stuckit in his hat; he determined to be merry and light-hearted,  for he wasgoing out into the wide world- \"a little way out, beyond the bay,\"as the  young eels had said.\"\\n\"Beware of bad people who will catchyou, and skin you, and put  you in the frying-pan!\"\\n he repeated inhis mind, and smiled, for he thought he should  find his way throughthe world- good courage is a strong weapon!\"\\n The sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrowentrance to Nissum Bay.\"\\n He looked back and saw a couple of horsemengalloping a long distance behind him, and  there were other people withthem.\"\\nBut this did not concern him.\"\\n The ferry-boat was on the opposite side of the bay.\"\\nJurgencalled to the ferry-man,  and the latter came over with his boat.Jurgen stepped in; but before he had got  half-way across, the men whomhe had seen riding so hastily, came up, hailed the  ferry-man, andcommanded him to return in the name of the law.\"\\nJurgen did notunderstand  the reason of this, but he thought it would be best to turnback, and therefore he  himself took an oar and returned.\"\\nAs soon asthe boat touched the shore, the men sprang  on board, and before he wasaware of it, they had bound his hands with a rope.\"\\n \"This wicked deed will cost you your life,\" they said.\"\\n\"It is agood thing we have  caught you.\"\\n  He was accused of nothing less than murder.\"\\nMartin had beenfound dead, with his throat  cut.\"\\nOne of the fishermen, late on theprevious evening, had met Jurgen going towards  Martin\\'s house; thiswas not the first time Jurgen had raised his knife against  Martin,so they felt sure that he was the murderer.\"\\nThe prison was in a townat a great  distance, and the wind was contrary for going there by sea;but it would not take half  an hour to get across the bay, andanother quarter of an hour would bring them to  Norre-Vosborg, thegreat castle with ramparts and moat.\"\\nOne of Jurgen\\'s captors was  afisherman, a brother of the keeper of the castle, and he said it mightbe managed  that Jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeonat Vosborg, where Long  Martha the gipsy had been shut up till herexecution.\"\\nThey paid no attention to Jurgen\\'s  defence; the few dropsof blood on his shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness against him.\"\\n But hewas conscious of his innocence, and as there was no chance of clearinghimself  at present he submitted to his fate.\"\\n The party landed just at the place where Sir Bugge\\'s castle hadstood, and where Jurgen  had walked with his foster-parents after theburial feast, during.\"\\nthe four happiest  days of his childhood.\"\\nHewas led by the well-known path, over the meadow to Vosborg;  oncemore the elders were in bloom and the lofty lime-trees gave forthsweet fragrance,  and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he hadlast seen the spot.\"\\nIn each of  the two wings of the castle there was astaircase which led to a place below the entrance,  from whence thereis access to a low, vaulted cellar.\"\\nIn this dungeon Long Martha  hadbeen imprisoned, and from here she was led away to the scaffold.\"\\nShehad eaten the  hearts of five children, and had imagined that if shecould obtain two more she would  be able to fly and make herselfinvisible.\"\\nIn the middle of the roof of the cellar  there was alittle narrow air-hole, but no window.\"\\nThe flowering lime treescould not  breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode, whereeverything was dark and mouldy.\"\\n There was only a rough bench in thecell; but a good conscience is a soft pillow, and  therefore Jurgencould sleep well.\"\\n The thick oaken door was locked, and secured on the outside byan iron bar; but the  goblin of superstition can creep through akeyhole into a baron\\'s castle just as easily  as it can into afisherman\\'s cottage, and why should he not creep in here, where  Jurgensat thinking of Long Martha and her wicked deeds?\"\\nHer last thoughts onthe night  before her execution had filled this place, and the magicthat tradition asserted to  have been practised here, in SirSvanwedel\\'s time, came into Jurgen\\'s mind, and made  him shudder; but asunbeam, a refreshing thought from without, penetrated his  hearteven here- it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweetsmelling  lime-trees.\"\\n He was not left there long.\"\\nThey took him away to the town ofRingkjobing, where he  was imprisoned with equal severity.\"\\n Those times were not like ours.\"\\nThe common people were treatedharshly; and it was  just after the days when farms were converted intoknights\\' estates, when coachmen  and servants were often mademagistrates, and had power to sentence a poor man, for  a smalloffence, to lose his property and to corporeal punishment.\"\\nJudges ofthis kind  were still to be found; and in Jutland, so far from thecapital, and from the  enlightened, well-meaning, head of theGovernment, the law was still very loosely  administered sometimes- thesmallest grievance Jurgen could expect was that his case  should bedelayed.\"\\n His dwelling was cold and comfortless; and how long would he beobliged to bear all  this?\"\\nIt seemed his fate to suffer misfortuneand sorrow innocently.\"\\nHe now had plenty  of time to reflect on thedifference of fortune on earth, and to wonder why this fate  had beenallotted to him; yet he felt sure that all would be made clear inthe next  life, the existence that awaits us when this life is over.His faith had grown strong  in the poor fisherman\\'s cottage; thelight which had never shone into his father\\'s  mind, in all therichness and sunshine of Spain, was sent to him to be his comfort  inpoverty and distress, a sign of that mercy of God which never fails.\"\\n The spring storms began to blow.\"\\nThe rolling and moaning of theNorth Sea could be  heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing,and then it sounded like the rushing  of a thousand waggons over a hardroad with a mine underneath.\"\\nJurgen heard these sounds  in hisprison, and it was a relief to him.\"\\nNo music could have touched hisheart as  did these sounds of the sea- the rolling sea, the boundlesssea, on which a man can  be borne across the world before the wind,carrying his own house with him wherever  he goes, just as the snailcarries its home even into a strange country.\"\\n He listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose-\"Free!\"\\nfree!\"\\nHow  happy to be free, even barefooted and in raggedclothes!\"\\n Sometimes, when such thoughts  crossed his mind, the fierynature rose within him, and he beat the wall with his  clenched fists.\"\\n Weeks, months, a whole year had gone by, when Niels the thief,called also a  horse-dealer, was arrested; and now better times came,and it was seen that Jurgen  had been wrongly accused.\"\\n On the afternoon before Jurgen\\'s departure from home, and beforethe murder, Niels  the thief, had met Martin at a beer-house in theneighbourhood of Ringkjobing.\"\\nA few  glasses were drank, not enoughto cloud the brain, but enough to loosen Martin\\'s tongue.\"\\n He beganto boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended tomarry, and  when Niels asked him where he was going to get the money,he slapped his pocket proudly  and said:  \"The money is here, where it ought to be.\"\\n  This boast cost him his life; for when he went home Niels followedhim, and cut his  throat, intending to rob the murdered man of thegold, which did not exist.\"\\n All this was circumstantially explained; but it is enough for usto know that Jurgen  was set free.\"\\nBut what compensation did he get forhaving been imprisoned a whole year,  and shut out from allcommunication with his fellow creatures?\"\\nThey told him he  wasfortunate in being proved innocent, and that he might go.\"\\nTheburgomaster gave him  two dollars for travelling expenses, and manycitizens offered him provisions and  beer- there were still goodpeople; they were not all hard and pitiless.\"\\nBut the best  thing of allwas that the merchant Bronne, of Skjagen, into whose service Jurgenhad  proposed entering the year before, was just at that time onbusiness in the town of  Ringkjobing.\"\\nBronne heard the whole story;he was kind-hearted, and understood what  Jurgen must have felt andsuffered.\"\\nTherefore he made up his mind to make it up to  the poor lad,and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world.\"\\n So Jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise, to findfreedom, affection, and  trust.\"\\nHe was to travel this path now, forno goblet of life is all bitterness; no  good man would pour out such adraught for his fellow-man, and how should He do it,  Who is lovepersonified?\"\\n \"Let everything be buried and forgotten,\" said Bronne, themerchant.\"\\n\"Let us draw a  thick line through last year: we will evenburn the almanack.\"\\nIn two days we will start  for dear, friendly,peaceful Skjagen.\"\\nPeople call it an out-of-the-way corner; but  it is agood warm chimney-corner, and its windows open toward every part ofthe world.\"\\n  What a journey that was: It was like taking fresh breath out ofthe cold dungeon air  into the warm sunshine.\"\\nThe heather bloomed inpride and beauty, and the shepherd-boy  sat on a barrow and blew hispipe, which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone.\"\\n FataMorgana, the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness, appearedwith hanging  gardens and waving forests, and the wonderful cloudcalled \"Lokeman driving his sheep\"  also was seen.\"\\n Up towards Skjagen they went, through the land of the Wendels,whence the men with  long beards (the Longobardi or Lombards) hademigrated in the reign of King Snio, when  all the children and oldpeople were to have been killed, till the noble Dame Gambaruk  proposedthat the young people should emigrate.\"\\nJurgen knew all this, he hadsome little  knowledge; and although he did not know the land of theLombards beyond the lofty Alps,  he had an idea that it must bethere, for in his boyhood he had been in the south,  in Spain.\"\\nHethought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit, of the redpomegranate  flowers, of the humming, buzzing, and toiling in the greatbeehive of a city he had  seen; but home is the best place after all,and Jurgen\\'s home was Denmark.\"\\n At last they arrived at \"Vendilskaga,\" as Skjagen is called in oldNorwegian and  Icelandic writings.\"\\nAt that time Old Skjagen, with theeastern and western town,  extended for miles, with sand hills andarable land as far as the lighthouse near  \"Grenen.\"\\n Then, as now,the houses were strewn among the wind-raised sand-hills\\ufffeawilderness in which the wind sports with the sand, and where the voiceof the sea-gull  and wild swan strikes harshly on the ear.\"\\n In the south-west, a mile from \"Grenen,\" lies Old Skjagen;merchant Bronne dwelt here,  and this was also to be Jurgen\\'s homefor the future.\"\\nThe dwelling-house was tarred,  and all the smallout-buildings had been put together from pieces of wreck.\"\\nThere was  nofence, for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long rowsof fishes which  were hung upon lines, one above the other, to dry inthe wind.\"\\nThe entire coast was  strewn with spoiled herrings, for therewere so many of these fish that a net was  scarcely thrown into the seabefore it was filled.\"\\nThey were caught by carloads, and  many of themwere either thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the beach.\"\\n The old man\\'s wife and daughter and his servants also came to meethim with great  rejoicing.\"\\nThere was a great squeezing of hands, andtalking and questioning.\"\\nAnd the  daughter, what a sweet face andbright eyes she had!\"\\n The inside of the house was comfortable and roomy.\"\\nFritters,that a king would have  looked upon as a dainty dish, were placed onthe table, and there was wine from the  Skjagen vineyard- that is,the sea; for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed  and preparedin barrels and in bottles.\"\\n When the mother and daughter heard who Jurgen was, and howinnocently he had suffered,  they looked at him in a still morefriendly way; and pretty Clara\\'s eyes had a look  of especialinterest as she listened to his story.\"\\nJurgen found a happy home inOld  Skjagen.\"\\nIt did his heart good, for it had been sorely tried.\"\\nHehad drunk the bitter  goblet of love which softens or hardens theheart, according to circumstances.\"\\n Jurgen\\'s heart was still soft- itwas young, and therefore it was a good thing that  Miss Clara was goingin three weeks\\' time to Christiansand in Norway, in her father\\'s  ship,to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter.\"\\n On the Sunday before she went away they all went to church, to theHoly Communion.\"\\n The church was large and handsome, and had beenbuilt centuries before by Scotchmen  and Dutchmen; it stood some littleway out of the town.\"\\nIt was rather ruinous certainly,  and the roadto it was heavy, through deep sand, but the people gladly surmountedthese  difficulties to get to the house of God, to sing psalms and tohear the sermon.\"\\nThe  sand had heaped itself up round the walls ofthe church, but the graves were kept free  from it.\"\\n It was the largest church north of the Limfjorden.\"\\nThe VirginMary, with a golden crown  on her head and the child Jesus in her arms,stood lifelike on the altar; the holy  Apostles had been carved inthe choir, and on the walls there were portraits of the  oldburgomasters and councillors of Skjagen; the pulpit was of carvedwork.\"\\nThe sun  shone brightly into the church, and its radiance fell onthe polished brass chandelier  and on the little ship that hung fromthe vaulted roof.\"\\n Jurgen felt overcome by a holy, childlike feeling, like that whichpossessed him, when,  as a boy, he stood in the splendid Spanishcathedral.\"\\nBut here the feeling was different,  for he felt consciousof being one of the congregation.\"\\n After the sermon followed Holy Communion.\"\\nHe partook of thebread and wine, and it  so happened that he knelt by the side of MissClara; but his thoughts were so fixed  upon heaven and the HolySacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose  fromhis knees, and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks.\"\\n She left Skjagen and went to Norway two days later.\"\\nHe remainedbehind, and made himself  useful on the farm and at the fishery.\"\\nHewent out fishing, and in those days fish  were more plentiful andlarger than they are now.\"\\nThe shoals of the mackerel glittered  inthe dark nights, and indicated where they were swimming; thegurnards snarled, and  the crabs gave forth pitiful yells when theywere chased, for fish are not so mute  as people say.\"\\n Every Sunday Jurgen went to church; and when his eyes rested onthe picture of the  Virgin Mary over the altar as he sat there, theyoften glided away to the spot where  they had knelt side by side.\"\\n Autumn came, and brought rain and snow with it; the water roseup right into the town  of Skjagen, the sand could not suck it allin, one had to wade through it or go by  boat.\"\\nThe storms threwvessel after vessel on the fatal reefs; there were snow-storm  andsand-storms; the sand flew up to the houses, blocking the entrances,so that people  had to creep up through the chimneys; that wasnothing at all remarkable here.\"\\nIt was  pleasant and cheerfulindoors, where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the  wrecksblazed and crackled upon the hearth.\"\\nMerchant Bronne read aloud,from an old  chronicle, about Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who had comeover from England, landed near  Bovbjerg, and fought a battle; close byRamme was his grave, only a few miles from  the place where theeel-breeder lived; hundreds of barrow rose there from the  heath,forming as it were an enormous churchyard.\"\\nMerchant Bronne hadhimself been at  Hamlet\\'s grave; they spoke about old times, and abouttheir neighbours, the English  and the Scotch, and Jurgen sang the airof \"The King of England\\'s Son,\" and of his  splendid ship and itsoutfit.\"\\n \"In the hour of peril when most men fear,  He clasped the bride that he held so dear,  And proved himself the son of a King;  Of his courage and valour let us sing.\"\\n  This verse Jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyesbeamed, and they were black  and sparkling since his infancy.\"\\n There was wealth, comfort, and happiness even among the domesticanimals, for they  were all well cared for, and well kept.\"\\nThekitchen looked bright with its copper and  tin utensils, and whiteplates, and from the rafters hung hams, beef, and winter stores  inplenty.\"\\nThis can still be seen in many rich farms on the west coast ofJutland: plenty  to eat and drink, clean, prettily decorated rooms,active minds, cheerful tempers,  and hospitality can be found there, asin an Arab\\'s tent.\"\\n Jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burialfeast, and yet Miss  Clara was absent, except in the thoughts andmemory of all.\"\\n In April a ship was to start for Norway, and Jurgen was to sail init.\"\\nHe was full  of life and spirits, and looked so sturdy and wellthat Dame Bronne said it did her  good to see him.\"\\n \"And it does one good to look at you also, old wife,\" said themerchant.\"\\n\"Jurgen has  brought fresh life into our winter evenings, andinto you too, mother.\"\\nYou look younger  than ever this year, and seemwell and cheerful.\"\\nBut then you were once the prettiest  girl inViborg, and that is saying a great deal, for I have always found theViborg  girls the prettiest of any.\"\\n  Jurgen said nothing, but he thought of a certain maiden ofSkjagen, whom he was soon  to visit.\"\\nThe ship set sail forChristiansand in Norway, and as the wind was favourable  it soonarrived there.\"\\n One morning merchant Bronne went out to the lighthouse, whichstands a little way out  of Old Skjagen, not far from \"Grenen.\"\\n Thelight was out, and the sun was already high  in the heavens, when hemounted the tower.\"\\nThe sand-banks extend a whole mile from  theshore, beneath the water, outside these banks; many ships could beseen that day,  and with the aid of his telescope the old man thoughthe descried his own ship, the  Karen Bronne.\"\\nYes!\"\\ncertainly, thereshe was, sailing homewards with Clara and Jurgen  on board.\"\\n Clara sat on deck, and saw the sand-hills gradually appearing inthe distance; the  church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swanrising from the blue waters.\"\\nIf  the wind held good they might reachhome in about an hour.\"\\nSo near they were to home  and all its joys-so near to death and all its terrors!\"\\nA plank in the ship gave way,and  the water rushed in; the crew flew to the pumps, and did theirbest to stop the leak.\"\\n A signal of distress was hoisted, but they werestill fully a mile from the shore.\"\\n Some fishing boats were in sight,but they were too far off to be of any use.\"\\nThe wind  blew towardsthe land, the tide was in their favour, but it was all useless; theship  could not be saved.\"\\n Jurgen threw his right arm round Clara, and pressed her to him.With what a look she  gazed up into his face, as with a prayer to Godfor help he breasted the waves, which  rushed over the sinking ship!She uttered a cry, but she felt safe and certain that  he would notleave her to sink.\"\\nAnd in this hour of terror and danger Jurgen feltas  the king\\'s son did, as told in the old song:  \"In the hour of peril when most men fear,  He clasped the bride that he held so dear.\"\\n  How glad he felt that he was a good swimmer!\"\\nHe worked his wayonward with his feet  and one arm, while he held the young girl upfirmly with the other.\"\\nHe rested on the  waves, he trod the water- infact, did everything he could think of, in order not to  fatiguehimself, and to reserve strength enough to reach land.\"\\nHe heardClara sigh,  and felt her shudder convulsively, and he pressed her moreclosely to him.\"\\nNow and  then a wave rolled over them, the currentlifted them; the water, although deep, was  so clear that for amoment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering,  orLeviathan himself ready to swallow them.\"\\nNow the clouds cast ashadow over the water,  then again came the playing sunbeams; flocks ofloudly screaming birds passed over  him, and the plump and lazy wildducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the  waves rose upterrified at the sight of the swimmer.\"\\nHe began to feel his  strengthdecreasing, but he was only a few cable lengths\\' distance from theshore, and  help was coming, for a boat was approaching him.\"\\nAt thismoment he distinctly saw a  white staring figure under the water- awave lifted him up, and he came nearer to the  figure- he felt aviolent shock, and everything became dark around him.\"\\n On the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship, which was covered withwater at high tide;  the white figure head rested against the anchor,the sharp iron edge of which rose  just above the surface.\"\\nJurgen hadcome in contact with this; the tide had driven him  against it withgreat force.\"\\nHe sank down stunned with the blow, but the next wavelifted  him and the young girl up again.\"\\nSome fishermen, coming witha boat, seized them and  dragged them into it.\"\\nThe blood streameddown over Jurgen\\'s face; he seemed dead, but  still held the young girlso tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by  force.\"\\nShewas pale and lifeless; they laid her in the boat, and rowed as quicklyas  possible to the shore.\"\\nThey tried every means to restore Clara tolife, but it was  all of no avail.\"\\nJurgen had been swimming for somedistance with a corpse in his arms,  and had exhausted his strength forone who was dead.\"\\n Jurgen still breathed, so the fishermen carried him to the nearesthouse upon the  sand-hills, where a smith and general dealer livedwho knew something of surgery, and  bound up Jurgen\\'s wounds in atemporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from  the nearesttown the next day.\"\\nThe injured man\\'s brain was affected, and in hisdelirium  he uttered wild cries; but on the third day he lay quietand weak upon his bed; his  life seemed to hang by a thread, and thephysician said it would be better for him  if this thread broke.\"\\n\"Letus pray that God may take him,\" he said, \"for he will never  be thesame man again.\"\\n  But life did not depart from him- the thread would not break,but the thread of memory  was severed; the thread of his mind hadbeen cut through, and what was still more  grievous, a body remained- aliving healthy body that wandered about like a troubled  spirit.\"\\n Jurgen remained in merchant Bronne\\'s house.\"\\n\"He was hurt whileendeavouring to save  our child,\" said the old man, \"and now he isour son.\"\\n People called Jurgen insane,  but that was not exactly thecorrect term.\"\\nHe was like an instrument in which the  strings are looseand will give no sound; only occasionally they regained their  powerfor a few minutes, and then they sounded as they used to do.\"\\nHewould sing snatches  of songs or old melodies, pictures of the pastwould rise before him, and then disappear  in the mist, as it were, butas a general rule he sat staring into vacancy, without  a thought.\"\\nWemay conjecture that he did not suffer, but his dark eyes lost  theirbrightness, and looked like clouded glass.\"\\n \"Poor mad Jurgen,\" said the people.\"\\nAnd this was the end of a lifewhose infancy was  to have been surrounded with wealth and splendourhad his parents lived!\"\\nAll his great  mental abilities had been lost,nothing but hardship, sorrow, and disappointment had  been his fate.\"\\nHewas like a rare plant, torn from its native soil, and tossed uponthe  beach to wither there.\"\\nAnd was this one of God\\'s creatures,fashioned in His own  likeness, to have no better fate?\"\\nWas he to beonly the plaything of fortune?\"\\nNo!\"\\nthe  all-loving Creator wouldcertainly repay him in the life to come for what he had  suffered andlost here.\"\\n\"The Lord is good to all; and His mercy is over all Hisworks.\"\\n  The pious old wife of the merchant repeated these words fromthe Psalms of David in  patience and hope, and the prayer of herheart was that Jurgen might soon be called  away to enter intoeternal life.\"\\n In the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sandClara lay buried.\"\\nJurgen  did not seem to know this; it did not enterhis mind, which could only retain fragments  of the past.\"\\nEverySunday he went to church with the old people, and sat theresilently,  staring vacantly before him.\"\\nOne day, when the Psalms werebeing sung, he sighed deeply,  and his eyes became bright; they werefixed upon a place near the altar where he had  knelt with his friendwho was dead.\"\\nHe murmured her name, and became deadly pale,  andtears rolled down his cheeks.\"\\nThey led him out of church; he toldthose standing  round him that he was well, and had never been ill; he,who had been so grievously  afflicted, the outcast, thrown upon theworld, could not remember his sufferings.\"\\nThe  Lord our Creator is wiseand full of loving kindness- who can doubt it?\"\\n In Spain, where balmy breezes blow over the Moorish cupolas andgently stir the orange  and myrtle groves, where singing and thesound of the castanets are always heard, the  richest merchant in theplace, a childless old man, sat in a luxurious house, while  childrenmarched in procession through the streets with waving flags andlighted tapers.\"\\n If he had been able to press his children to hisheart, his daughter, or her child,  that had, perhaps never seen thelight of day, far less the kingdom of heaven, how  much of his wealthwould he not have given!\"\\n\"Poor child!\"\\n Yes, poor child- a child  still,yet more than thirty years old, for Jurgen had arrived at this agein Old Skjagen.\"\\n The shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard,quite up to the church  walls, but still, the dead must be buried amongtheir relatives and the dear ones who  had gone before them.\"\\nMerchantBronne and his wife now rested with their children under  the whitesand.\"\\n It was in the spring- the season of storms.\"\\nThe sand from thedunes was whirled up  in clouds; the sea was rough, and flocks of birdsflew like clouds in the storm,  screaming across the sand-hills.Shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs  between Old Skagenand the Hunsby dunes.\"\\n One evening Jurgen sat in his room alone: all at once his mindseemed to become clearer,  and a restless feeling came over him, suchas had often, in his younger days, driven  him out to wander over thesand-hills or on the heath.\"\\n\"Home, home!\"\\n he cried.\"\\nNo one  heardhim.\"\\nHe went out and walked towards the dunes.\"\\nSand and stones blewinto his face,  and whirled round him; he went in the direction ofthe church.\"\\nThe sand was banked  up the walls, half covering thewindows, but it had been cleared away in front of the  door, and theentrance was free and easy to open, so Jurgen went into the church.\"\\n The storm raged over the town of Skjagen; there had not beensuch a terrible tempest  within the memory of the inhabitants, nor sucha rough sea.\"\\nBut Jurgen was in the temple  of God, and while thedarkness of night reigned outside, a light arose in his soul  thatwas never to depart from it; the heavy weight that pressed on hisbrain burst  asunder.\"\\nHe fancied he heard the organ, but it was onlythe storm and the moaning of  the sea.\"\\nHe sat down on one of the seats,and lo!\"\\nthe candies were lighted one by one,  and there wasbrightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the Spanishcathedral.\"\\n The portraits of the old citizens became alive, steppeddown from the walls against  which they had hung for centuries, andtook seats near the church door.\"\\nThe gates flew  open, and all the deadpeople from the churchyard came in, and filled the church,  whilebeautiful music sounded.\"\\nThen the melody of the psalm burst forth,like the sound  of the waters, and Jurgen saw that his foster parentsfrom the Hunsby dunes were there,  also old merchant Bronne with hiswife and their daughter Clara, who gave him her hand.\"\\n They both wentup to the altar where they had knelt before, and the priest joinedtheir  hands and united them for life.\"\\nThen music was heard again; itwas wonderfully sweet,  like a child\\'s voice, full of joy andexpectation, swelling to the powerful tones of  a full organ, sometimessoft and sweet, then like the sounds of a tempest, delightful  andelevating to hear, yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of thedead.\"\\nThen  the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir waslet down and looked wonderfully  large and beautiful with its silkensails and rigging:  \"The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,  And everywhere riches and pomp untold,\"as the old song says.\"\\n The young couple went on board, accompanied by the wholecongregation, for there was  room and enjoyment for them all.\"\\nThenthe walls and arches of the church were covered  with floweringjunipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance; the branches  waved,creating a pleasant coolness; they bent and parted, and the shipsailed between  them through the air and over the sea.\"\\nEvery candlein the church became a star, and  the wind sang a hymn in which theyall joined.\"\\n\"Through love to glory, no life is lost,  the future isfull of blessings and happiness.\"\\nHallelujah!\"\\n These were the lastwords  Jurgen uttered in this world, for the thread that bound hisimmortal soul was severed,  and nothing but the dead body lay in thedark church, while the storm raged outside,  covering it with loosesand.\"\\n The next day was Sunday, and the congregation and their pastorwent to the church.\"\\n The road had always been heavy, but now it wasalmost unfit for use, and when they  at last arrived at the church, agreat heap of sand lay piled up in front of them.\"\\n The whole church wascompletely buried in sand.\"\\nThe clergyman offered a short prayer,  andsaid that God had closed the door of His house here, and that thecongregation must  go and build a new one for Him somewhere else.\"\\nSothey sung a hymn in the open air,  and went home again.\"\\n Jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of Skjagen, noron the dunes, though  they searched for him everywhere.\"\\nThey came tothe conclusion that one of the great  waves, which had rolled far upon the beach, had carried him away; but his body lay  buried in agreat sepulchre- the church itself.\"\\nThe Lord had thrown down acovering  for his grave during the storm, and the heavy mound of sandlies upon it to this day.\"\\n The drifting sand had covered the vaultedroof of the church, the arched cloisters,  and the stone aisles.\"\\nThewhite thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place  where thechurch lies buried, but the spire, like an enormous monument over agrave,  can be seen for miles round.\"\\nNo king has a more splendidmemorial.\"\\nNothing disturbs  the peaceful sleep of the dead.\"\\nI was thefirst to hear this story, for the storm sung  it to me among thesand-hills.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  ANNE LISBETH  by Hans Christian Andersen  ANNE LISBETH was a beautiful young woman, with a red and whitecomplexion, glittering  white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and herfootstep was light in the dance, but her  mind was lighter still.\"\\nShehad a little child, not at all pretty; so he was put out  to benursed by a laborer\\'s wife, and his mother went to the count\\'s castle.She sat  in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet;not a breath of air was  allowed to blow upon her, and no one wasallowed to speak to her harshly, for she was  nurse to the count\\'schild.\"\\nHe was fair and delicate as a prince, and beautiful as  anangel; and how she loved this child!\"\\nHer own boy was provided for bybeing at the  laborer\\'s where the mouth watered more frequently thanthe pot boiled, and where in  general no one was at home to take careof the child.\"\\nThen he would cry, but what nobody  knows nobody caresfor; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep;  andwhile we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst.\"\\nAh, yes;sleep is a  capital invention.\"\\n As years went on, Anne Lisbeth\\'s child grew apace like weeds,although they said his  growth had been stunted.\"\\nHe had become quitea member of the family in which he dwelt;  they received money tokeep him, so that his mother got rid of him altogether.\"\\nShe  had becomequite a lady; she had a comfortable home of her own in the town; andout  of doors, when she went for a walk, she wore a bonnet; but shenever walked out to  see the laborer: that was too far from the town,and, indeed, she had nothing to go  for, the boy now belonged tothese laboring people.\"\\nHe had food, and he could also  do somethingtowards earning his living; he took care of Mary\\'s red cow, for heknew  how to tend cattle and make himself useful.\"\\n The great dog by the yard gate of a nobleman\\'s mansion sitsproudly on the top of his  kennel when the sun shines, and barks atevery one that passes; but if it rains, he  creeps into his house,and there he is warm and dry.\"\\nAnne Lisbeth\\'s boy also sat in  thesunshine on the top of the fence, cutting out a little toy.\"\\nIf itwas spring-time,  he knew of three strawberry-plants in blossom,which would certainly bear fruit.\"\\nThis  was his most hopeful thought,though it often came to nothing.\"\\nAnd he had to sit out  in the rainin the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the cold winddry  the clothes on his back afterwards.\"\\nIf he went near the farmyardbelonging to the count,  he was pushed and knocked about, for the menand the maids said he was so horrible  ugly; but he was used to allthis, for nobody loved him.\"\\nThis was how the world treated  AnneLisbeth\\'s boy, and how could it be otherwise.\"\\nIt was his fate to bebeloved by  no one.\"\\nHitherto he had been a land crab; the land atlast cast him adrift.\"\\nHe went  to sea in a wretched vessel, and satat the helm, while the skipper sat over the grog-can.\"\\n He was dirty andugly, half-frozen and half-starved; he always looked as if he neverhad  enough to eat, which was really the case.\"\\n Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet,and the cold penetrated  through the thickest clothing, especially atsea, a wretched boat went out to sea with  only two men on board, or,more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the skipper  and hisboy.\"\\nThere had only been a kind of twilight all day, and it soongrew quite  dark, and so bitterly cold, that the skipper took a dram towarm him.\"\\nThe bottle was  old, and the glass too.\"\\nIt was perfect in theupper part, but the foot was broken off,  and it had therefore beenfixed upon a little carved block of wood, painted blue.\"\\nA  dram is agreat comfort, and two are better still, thought the skipper, whilethe boy  sat at the helm, which he held fast in his hard seamedhands.\"\\nHe was ugly, and his  hair was matted, and he looked crippledand stunted; they called him the  field-laborer\\'s boy, though in thechurch register he was entered as Anne Lisbeth\\'s  son.\"\\nThe wind cutthrough the rigging, and the boat cut through the sea.\"\\nThe  sails,filled by the wind, swelled out and carried them along in wild career.It was  wet and rough above and below, and might still be worse.Hold!\"\\nwhat is that?\"\\nWhat has  struck the boat?\"\\nWas it a waterspout,or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them?\"\\n \"Heaven help us!\"\\n cried the boy at the helm, as the boat heeledover and lay on its  beam ends.\"\\nIt had struck on a rock, which rosefrom the depths of the sea, and sank  at once, like an old shoe in apuddle.\"\\n\"It sank at once with mouse and man,\" as the  saying is.There might have been mice on board, but only one man and a half,the skipper  and the laborer\\'s boy.\"\\nNo one saw it but the skimmingsea-gulls and the fishes beneath  the water; and even they did notsee it properly, for they darted back with terror  as the boat filledwith water and sank.\"\\nThere it lay, scarcely a fathom below thesurface,  and those two were provided for, buried, and forgotten.\"\\nTheglass with the foot of  blue wood was the only thing that did not sink,for the wood floated and the glass  drifted away to be cast upon theshore and broken; where and when, is indeed of no  consequence.\"\\nIthad served its purpose, and it had been loved, which Anne Lisbeth\\'sboy  had not been.\"\\nBut in heaven no soul will be able to say, \"Neverloved.\"\\n  Anne Lisbeth had now lived in the town many years; she wascalled \"Madame,\" and felt  dignified in consequence; she remembered theold, noble days, in which she had driven  in the carriage, and hadassociated with countess and baroness.\"\\nHer beautiful, noble  childhad been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he had lovedher so much,  and she had loved him in return; they had kissed andloved each other, and the boy  had been her joy, her second life.\"\\nNowhe was fourteen years of age, tall, handsome,  and clever.\"\\nShe hadnot seen him since she carried him in her arms; neither had she  beenfor years to the count\\'s palace; it was quite a journey thither fromthe town.\"\\n \"I must make one effort to go,\" said Anne Lisbeth, \"to see mydarling, the count\\'s  sweet child, and press him to my heart.\"\\nCertainlyhe must long to see me, too, the  young count; no doubt he thinks of meand loves me, as in those days when he would  fling his angel-armsround my neck, and lisp \\'Anne Liz.\\' It was music to my ears.\"\\nYes,  Imust make an effort to see him again.\"\\n She drove across the country ina grazier\\'s  cart, and then got out, and continued her journey on foot,and thus reached the count\\'s  castle.\"\\nIt was as great and magnificentas it had always been, and the garden looked  the same as ever; all theservants were strangers to her, not one of them knew Anne  Lisbeth, norof what consequence she had once been there; but she felt sure thecountess  would soon let them know it, and her darling boy, too: howshe longed to see him!\"\\n Now that Anne Lisbeth was at her journey\\'s end, she was keptwaiting a long time; and  for those who wait, time passes slowly.\"\\nButbefore the great people went in to dinner,  she was called in andspoken to very graciously.\"\\nShe was to go in again after dinner,  andthen she would see her sweet boy once more.\"\\nHow tall, and slender, andthin he had  grown; but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were stillbeautiful.\"\\nHe looked at her,  but he did not speak, he certainly didnot know who she was.\"\\nHe turned round and was  going away, but sheseized his hand and pressed it to her lips.\"\\n \"Well, well,\" he said; and with that he walked out of the room.\"\\nHewho filled her every  thought!\"\\nhe whom she loved best, and who washer whole earthly pride!\"\\n Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road,feeling mournful and  sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, andeven now carried about in her dreams,  had been cold and strange, andhad not a word or thought respecting her.\"\\nA great black  raven darteddown in front of her on the high road, and croaked dismally.\"\\n \"Ah,\" said she, \"what bird of ill omen art thou?\"\\n Presently shepassed the laborer\\'s  hut; his wife stood at the door, and the twowomen spoke to each other.\"\\n \"You look well,\" said the woman; \"you\\'re fat and plump; you arewell off.\"\\n  \"Oh yes,\" answered Anne Lisbeth.\"\\n \"The boat went down with them,\" continued the woman; \"Hans theskipper and the boy  were both drowned; so there\\'s an end of them.\"\\nIalways thought the boy would be able  to help me with a few dollars.He\\'ll never cost you anything more, Anne Lisbeth.\"\\n  \"So they were drowned,\" repeated Anne Lisbeth; but she said nomore, and the subject  was dropped.\"\\nShe felt very low-spirited, becauseher count-child had shown no  inclination to speak to her who loved himso well, and who had travelled so far to  see him.\"\\nThe journey had costmoney too, and she had derived no great pleasure from  it.\"\\nStill shesaid not a word of all this; she could not relieve her heart bytelling  the laborer\\'s wife, lest the latter should think she did notenjoy her former position  at the castle.\"\\nThen the raven flew over her,screaming again as he flew.\"\\n \"The black wretch!\"\\n said Anne Lisbeth, \"he will end by frighteningme today.\"\\n She had  brought coffee and chicory with her, for shethought it would be a charity to the poor  woman to give them to her toboil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup herself.\"\\n The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne Lisbethseated her in a chair  and fell asleep.\"\\nThen she dreamed of somethingwhich she had never dreamed before;  singularly enough she dreamed ofher own child, who had wept and hungered in the  laborer\\'s hut, and hadbeen knocked about in heat and in cold, and who was now lying  in thedepths of the sea, in a spot only known by God.\"\\nShe fancied she wasstill sitting  in the hut, where the woman was busy preparing thecoffee, for she could smell the  coffee-berries roasting.\"\\nButsuddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the  threshold abeautiful young form, as beautiful as the count\\'s child, and  thisapparition said to her, \"The world is passing away; hold fast to me,for you are  my mother after all; you have an angel in heaven, holdme fast;\" and the child-angel  stretched out his hand and seized her.Then there was a terrible crash, as of a world  crumbling to pieces,and the angel-child was rising from the earth, and holding her  bythe sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground;but, on the other  hand, something heavy hung to her feet and draggedher down, and it seemed as if  hundreds of women were clinging toher, and crying, \"If thou art to be saved, we must  be saved too.Hold fast, hold fast.\"\\n And then they all hung on her, but there weretoo  many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth felldown in horror,  and awoke.\"\\nIndeed she was on the point of falling overin reality with the chair on  which she sat; but she was so startledand alarmed that she could not remember what  she had dreamed, onlythat it was something very dreadful.\"\\n They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then AnneLisbeth went away towards  the little town where she was to meet thecarrier, who was to drive her back to her  own home.\"\\nBut when shecame to him she found that he would not be ready to start till  theevening of the next day.\"\\nThen she began to think of the expense, andwhat the  distance would be to walk.\"\\nShe remembered that the route bythe sea-shore was two miles  shorter than by the high road; and asthe weather was clear, and there would be  moonlight, she determined tomake her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might  reachhome the next day.\"\\n The sun had set, and the evening bells sounded through the airfrom the tower of the  village church, but to her it was not the bells,but the cry of the frogs in the marshes.\"\\n Then they ceased, and allaround became still; not a bird could be heard, they were  all at rest,even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned onthe  margin of the wood by the sea-shore.\"\\nAs Anne Lisbeth walked on shecould hear her own  footsteps in the sands; even the waves of the seawere at rest, and all in the deep  waters had sunk into silence.There was quiet among the dead and the living in the  deep sea.\"\\nAnneLisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, orrather  her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought isnever absent from us,  it only slumbers.\"\\nMany thoughts that have laindormant are roused at the proper time,  and begin to stir in the mindand the heart, and seem even to come upon us from above.\"\\n It iswritten, that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit; and it isalso written,  that the wages of sin is death.\"\\nMuch has been said andmuch written which we pass over  or know nothing of.\"\\nA light ariseswithin us, and then forgotten things make themselves  remembered; andthus it was with Anne Lisbeth.\"\\nThe germ of every vice and every  virtuelies in our heart, in yours and in mine; they lie like little grainsof seed,  till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, oryou turn the corner to the  right or to the left, and the decision ismade.\"\\nThe little seed is stirred, it swells  and shoots up, and poursits sap into your blood, directing your course either for  good orevil.\"\\nTroublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermentingthere, which  are not realized by us while the senses are as it wereslumbering; but still they are  there.\"\\nAnne Lisbeth walked on thus withher senses half asleep, but the thoughts were  fermenting within her.\"\\n From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh downthe heart; it is the  reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten,sins against heaven in word and  thought, sins against our neighbor,and against our own conscience.\"\\nWe are scarcely  aware of theirexistence; and Anne Lisbeth did not think of any of her errors.\"\\nShehad  committed no crime against the law of the land; she was anhonorable person, in a good  position- that she knew.\"\\n She continued her walk along by the margin of the sea.\"\\nWhat was itshe saw lying there?\"\\n An old hat; a man\\'s hat.\"\\nNow when might that havebeen washed overboard?\"\\nShe drew nearer,  she stopped to look at thehat; \"Ha!\"\\nwhat was lying yonder?\"\\n She shuddered; yet it  was nothingsave a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone,but  it looked like a corpse.\"\\nOnly tangled grass, and yet she wasfrightened at it.\"\\nAs she  turned to walk away, much came into hermind that she had heard in her childhood: old  superstitions ofspectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but  unburiedpeople, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach.\"\\nThebody, she  knew, could do no harm to any one, but the spirit couldpursue the lonely wanderer,  attach itself to him, and demand to becarried to the churchyard, that it might rest  in consecrated ground.\"\\nHold fast!\"\\nhold fast!\"\\n the spectre would cry; and as Anne  Lisbethmurmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenlyrecalled  to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, anduttered these words, when, amid  the crashing of worlds, her sleeve hadbeen torn, and she had slipped from the grasp  of her child, who wantedto hold her up in that terrible hour.\"\\nHer child, her own  child,which she had never loved, lay now buried in the sea, and might riseup, like  a spectre, from the waters, and cry, \"Hold fast; carry meto consecrated ground!\"\\n  As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed toher feet, so that she  walked faster and faster.\"\\nFear came upon heras if a cold, clammy hand had been laid  upon her heart, so that shealmost fainted.\"\\nAs she looked across the sea, all there  grew darker; aheavy mist came rolling onwards, and clung to bush and tree,distorting  them into fantastic shapes.\"\\nShe turned and glanced at themoon, which had risen behind  her.\"\\nIt looked like a pale, raylesssurface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon  her limbs.\"\\n\"Hold,\"thought she; and then she turned round a second time to look at  themoon.\"\\nA white face appeared quite close to her, with a mist, hanginglike a garment  from its shoulders.\"\\n\"Stop!\"\\ncarry me to consecratedearth,\" sounded in her ears, in  strange, hollow tones.\"\\nThe sound didnot come from frogs or ravens; she saw no sign  of such creatures.\"\\n\"Agrave!\"\\ndig me a grave!\"\\n was repeated quite loud.\"\\nYes, it was  indeedthe spectre of her child.\"\\nThe child that lay beneath the ocean, andwhose spirit  could have no rest until it was carried to thechurchyard, and until a grave had been  dug for it in consecratedground.\"\\nShe would go there at once, and there she would dig.\"\\n Sheturned in the direction of the church, and the weight on her heartseemed to grow  lighter, and even to vanish altogether; but when sheturned to go home by the shortest  way, it returned.\"\\n\"Stop!\"\\nstop!\"\\nand the words came quite clear, though they were like  the croak of afrog, or the wail of a bird.\"\\n\"A grave!\"\\ndig me a grave!\"\\n  The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist andclammy with horror, a  heavy weight again seized her and clung toher, her mind became clear for thoughts  that had never before beenthere.\"\\n In these northern regions, a beech-wood often buds in a singlenight and appears in  the morning sunlight in its full glory ofyouthful green.\"\\nSo, in a single instant,  can the consciousness ofthe sin that has been committed in thoughts, words, and  actions of ourpast life, be unfolded to us.\"\\nWhen once the conscience is awakened,  itsprings up in the heart spontaneously, and God awakens theconscience when we least  expect it.\"\\nThen we can find no excuse forourselves; the deed is there and bears witness  against us.\"\\nThethoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world.\"\\n Weare horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us, and atthe  consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has itsorigin in  thoughtlessness and pride.\"\\nThe heart conceals withinitself the vices as well as the  virtues, and they grow in theshallowest ground.\"\\nAnne Lisbeth now experienced in  thought what wehave clothed in words.\"\\nShe was overpowered by them, and sank downand  crept along for some distance on the ground.\"\\n\"A grave!\"\\ndig me agrave!\"\\n sounded again  in her ears, and she would have gladly buriedherself, if in the grave she could have  found forgetfulness of heractions.\"\\n It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish andhorror.\"\\nSuperstition made  her alternately shudder with cold or burnwith the heat of fever.\"\\nMany things, of which  she had feared even tospeak, came into her mind.\"\\nSilently, as the cloud-shadows in  themoonshine, a spectral apparition flitted by her; she had heard of itbefore.\"\\nClose  by her galloped four snorting steeds, with fire flashingfrom their eyes and nostrils.\"\\n They dragged a burning coach, and withinit sat the wicked lord of the manor, who had  ruled there a hundredyears before.\"\\nThe legend says that every night, at twelve  o\\'clock,he drove into his castleyard and out again.\"\\nHe was not as pale as deadmen  are, but black as a coal.\"\\nHe nodded, and pointed to AnneLisbeth, crying out, \"Hold  fast!\"\\nhold fast!\"\\nand then you may rideagain in a nobleman\\'s carriage, and forget your  child.\"\\n  She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard; but blackcrosses and black  ravens danced before her eyes, and she could notdistinguish one from the other.\"\\nThe  ravens croaked as the raven haddone which she saw in the daytime, but now she  understood what theysaid.\"\\n\"I am the raven-mother; I am the raven-mother,\" each  ravencroaked, and Anne Lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her;and she fancied  she should be transformed into a black bird, andhave to cry as they cried, if she  did not dig the grave.\"\\nAnd she threwherself upon the earth, and with her hands dug  a grave in the hardground, so that the blood ran from her fingers.\"\\n\"A grave!\"\\ndig me  agrave!\"\\n still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock mightcrow, and the  first red streak appear in the east, before she hadfinished her work; and then she  would be lost.\"\\nAnd the cock crowed,and the day dawned in the east, and the grave was  only half dug.\"\\nAnicy hand passed over her head and face, and down towards her  heart.\"\\nOnly half a grave,\" a voice wailed, and fled away.\"\\nYes, it fledaway over the  sea; it was the ocean spectre; and, exhausted andoverpowered, Anne Lisbeth sunk to  the ground, and her senses left her.\"\\n It was a bright day when she came to herself, and two men wereraising her up; but  she was not lying in the churchyard, but on thesea-shore, where she had dug a deep  hole in the sand, and cut her handwith a piece of broken glass, whose sharp stern  was stuck in alittle block of painted wood.\"\\nAnne Lisbeth was in a fever.Conscience  had roused the memories of superstitions, and had soacted upon her mind, that she  fancied she had only half a soul, andthat her child had taken the other half down  into the sea.\"\\nNever wouldshe be able to cling to the mercy of Heaven till she had  recoveredthis other half which was now held fast in the deep water.\"\\n Anne Lisbeth returned to her home, but she was no longer the womanshe had been.\"\\nHer  thoughts were like a confused, tangled skein; onlyone thread, only one thought was  clear to her, namely that she mustcarry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard,  and dig agrave for him there; that by so doing she might win back her soul.Many a  night she was missed from her home, and was always found on thesea-shore waiting for  the spectre.\"\\n In this way a whole year passed; and then one night she vanishedagain, and was not  to be found.\"\\nThe whole of the next day was spent ina useless search after her.\"\\n Towards evening, when the clerk entered the church to toll thevesper bell, he saw  by the altar Anne Lisbeth, who had spent the wholeday there.\"\\nHer powers of body were  almost exhausted, but her eyesflashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush.\"\\n The last rays ofthe setting sun shone upon her, and gleamed over the altar upon  theshining clasps of the Bible, which lay open at the words of theprophet Joel, \"Rend  your hearts and not your garments, and turn untothe Lord.\"\\n  \"That was just a chance,\" people said; but do things happen bychance?\"\\nIn the face  of Anne Lisbeth, lighted up by the evening sun,could be seen peace and rest.\"\\nShe said  she was happy now, for shehad conquered.\"\\nThe spectre of the shore, her own child,  had come toher the night before, and had said to her, \"Thou hast dug me only halfa  grave: but thou hast now, for a year and a day, buried me altogetherin thy heart,  and it is there a mother can best hide her child!\"\\n Andthen he gave her back her lost  soul, and brought her into thechurch.\"\\n\"Now I am in the house of God,\" she said, \"and  in that housewe are happy.\"\\n  When the sun set, Anne Lisbeth\\'s soul had risen to that regionwhere there is no more  pain; and Anne Lisbeth\\'s troubles were at anend.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a sculptor, named Alfred, who having won thelarge gold medal and  obtained a travelling scholarship, went to Italy,and then came back to his native  land.\"\\nHe was young at that time-indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years  older than hewas then.\"\\nOn his return, he went to visit one of the little towns inthe  island of Zealand.\"\\nThe whole town knew who the stranger was; andone of the richest  men in the place gave a party in his honor, and allwho were of any consequence, or  who possessed some property, wereinvited.\"\\nIt was quite an event, and all the town  knew of it, so thatit was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum.Apprentice-boys,  children of the poor, and even the poor peoplethemselves, stood before the house,  watching the lighted windows;and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a party  also,there were so many people in the streets.\"\\nThere was quite an air offestivity  about it, and the house was full of it; for Mr.\"\\nAlfred,the sculptor, was there.\"\\nHe  talked and told anecdotes, and every onelistened to him with pleasure, not unmingled  with awe; but none feltso much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval  officer.She seemed, so far as Mr.\"\\nAlfred was concerned, to be like a pieceof fresh  blotting-paper that absorbed all he said and asked formore.\"\\nShe was very appreciative,  and incredibly ignorant- a kind offemale Gaspar Hauser.\"\\n \"I should like to see Rome,\" she said; \"it must be a lovelycity, or so many foreigners  would not be constantly arriving there.Now, do give me a description of Rome.\"\\nHow  does the city look when youenter in at the gate?\"\\n  \"I cannot very well describe it,\" said the sculptor; \"but youenter on a large open  space, in the centre of which stands an obelisk,which is a thousand years old.\"\\n  \"An organist!\"\\n exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the word\\'obelisk.\\' Several  of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing,and the sculptor would have had some  difficulty in keeping hiscountenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he  caught sightof a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.They  belonged to her daughter; and surely no one who had such adaughter could be silly.\"\\n The mother was like a fountain ofquestions; and the daughter, who listened but never  spoke, mighthave passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain.\"\\nHow charming shewas!\"\\n She was a study for the sculptor to contemplate, but not toconverse with; for she  did not speak, or, at least, very seldom.\"\\n \"Has the pope a great family?\"\\n inquired the lady.\"\\n The young man answered considerately, as if the question hadbeen a different one,  \"No; he does not come from a great family.\"\\n  \"That is not what I asked,\" persisted the widow; \"I mean, has he awife and children?\"\\n  \"The pope is not allowed to marry,\" replied the gentleman.\"\\n \"I don\\'t like that,\" was the lady\\'s remark.\"\\n She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if shehad not been allowed  to say just what she liked, would her daughterhave been there, leaning so gracefully  on her shoulder, and lookingstraight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful  on herface?\"\\n Mr.\"\\nAlfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors inItalian scenery; the  purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean,the azure of southern skies, whose  brightness and glory could onlybe surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of  a maiden; and hesaid this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should  haveunderstood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which alsowas charming.\"\\n \"Beautiful Italy!\"\\n sighed some of the guests.\"\\n \"Oh, to travel there!\"\\n exclaimed others.\"\\n \"Charming!\"\\nCharming!\"\\n echoed from every voice.\"\\n \"I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery,\"said the naval officer\\'s  widow; \"and if I do, we will travel- I and mydaughter; and you, Mr.\"\\nAlfred, must be  our guide.\"\\nWe can all threetravel together, with one or two more of our good friends.\"\\n  And shenodded in such a friendly way at the company, that each imaginedhimself to  be the favored person who was to accompany them to Italy.\"\\nYes, we must go,\" she  continued; \"but not to those parts wherethere are robbers.\"\\nWe will keep to Rome.\"\\nIn  the public roads one isalways safe.\"\\n  The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in asigh, or attributed  to it!\"\\nThe young man attributed a great deal ofmeaning to this sigh.\"\\nThose deep-blue  eyes, which had been lit up thisevening in honor of him, must conceal treasures,  treasures of heartand mind, richer than all the glories of Rome; and so when he left  theparty that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady.\"\\nThehouse of the  naval officer\\'s widow was the one most constantly visitedby Mr.\"\\nAlfred, the sculptor.\"\\n It was soon understood that his visitswere not intended for that lady, though they  were the persons who keptup the conversation.\"\\nHe came for the sake of the daughter.\"\\n They calledher Kaela.\"\\nHer name was really Karen Malena, and these two names hadbeen  contracted into the one name Kaela.\"\\nShe was really beautiful; butsome said she was  rather dull, and slept late of a morning.\"\\n \"She has been accustomed to that,\" her mother said.\"\\n\"She is abeauty, and they are  always easily tired.\"\\nShe does sleep ratherlate; but that makes her eyes so clear.\"\\n  What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes!\"\\nTheyoung man felt the truth  of the proverb, \"Still waters run deep:\"and his heart had sunk into their depths.\"\\n He often talked of hisadventures, and the mamma was as simple and eager in her  questionsas on the first evening they met.\"\\nIt was a pleasure to hear Alfreddescribe  anything.\"\\nHe showed them colored plates of Naples, andspoke of excursions to Mount  Vesuvius, and the eruptions of firefrom it.\"\\nThe naval officer\\'s widow had never heard  of them before.\"\\n \"Good heavens!\"\\n she exclaimed.\"\\n\"So that is a burning mountain; butis it not very  dangerous to the people who live near it?\"\\n  \"Whole cities have been destroyed,\" he replied; \"for instance,Herculaneum and  Pompeii.\"\\n  \"Oh, the poor people!\"\\nAnd you saw all that with your own eyes?\"\\n  \"No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are represented inthose pictures; but  I will show you a sketch of my own, whichrepresents an eruption I once saw.\"\\n  He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had beenover-powered with the  appearance of the colored plates, threw a glanceat the pale drawing and cried in  astonishment, \"What, did you see itthrow up white fire?\"\\n  For a moment, Alfred\\'s respect for Kaela\\'s mamma underwent asudden shock, and lessened  considerably; but, dazzled by the lightwhich surrounded Kaela, he soon found it quite  natural that the oldlady should have no eye for color.\"\\nAfter all, it was of very  littleconsequence; for Kaela\\'s mamma had the best of all possessions;namely, Kaela  herself.\"\\n Alfred and Kaela were betrothed, which was a very naturalresult; and the betrothal  was announced in the newspaper of the littletown.\"\\nMama purchased thirty copies of  the paper, that she might cutout the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances.\"\\n Thebetrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too.\"\\nShe saidit seemed  like connecting herself with Thorwalsden.\"\\n \"You are a true successor of Thorwalsden,\" she said to Alfred; andit seemed to him  as if, in this instance, mamma had said a cleverthing.\"\\nKaela was silent; but her eyes  shone, her lips smiled, everymovement was graceful,- in fact, she was beautiful; that  cannot berepeated too often.\"\\nAlfred decided to take a bust of Kaela as wellas of her  mother.\"\\nThey sat to him accordingly, and saw how hemoulded and formed the soft clay  with his fingers.\"\\n \"I suppose it is only on our account that you perform thiscommon-place work yourself,  instead of leaving it to your servant todo all that sticking together.\"\\n  \"It is really necessary that I should mould the clay myself,\" hereplied.\"\\n \"Ah, yes, you are always so polite,\" said mamma, with a smile; andKaela silently  pressed his hand, all soiled as it was with the clay.\"\\n Then he unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in all herworks; he pointed  out to them how, in the scale of creation, inanimatematter was inferior to animate  nature; the plant above the mineral,the animal above the plant, and man above them  all.\"\\nHe strove toshow them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the  outwardform, and that it was the sculptor\\'s task to seize upon that beauty  ofexpression, and produce it in his works.\"\\nKaela stood silent, butnodded in  approbation of what he said, while mamma-in-law made thefollowing confession:-  \"It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along afteryou with my thoughts,  though what you say makes my head whirl roundand round.\"\\nStill I contrive to lay hold  on some of it.\"\\n  Kaela\\'s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his soul,and held a mastery over  him.\"\\nBeauty beamed from Kaela\\'s every feature,glittered in her eyes, lurked in the  corners of her mouth, andpervaded every movement of her agile fingers.\"\\nAlfred, the  sculptor,saw this.\"\\nHe spoke only to her, thought only of her, and the twobecame one;  and so it may be said she spoke much, for he was alwaystalking to her; and he and  she were one.\"\\nSuch was the betrothal, andthen came the wedding, with bride\\'s-maids  and wedding presents, allduly mentioned in the wedding speech.\"\\nMamma-in-law had set  upThorwalsden\\'s bust at the end of the table, attired in adressing-gown; it was her  fancy that he should be a guest.\"\\nSongswere sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay  wedding, and they were ahandsome pair.\"\\n\"Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\" said one of  the songs.\"\\n \"Ah, that is some of your mythologies,\" said mamma-in-law.\"\\n Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen, where they wereto live;  mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the \"coarsework,\" as she always called  the domestic arrangements.\"\\nKaela lookedlike a doll in a doll\\'s house, for everything  was bright and new,and so fine.\"\\nThere they sat, all three; and as for Alfred, a  proverbmay describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese.The magic  of form had enchanted him; he had looked at the casketwithout caring to inquire what  it contained, and that omission oftenbrings the greatest unhappiness into married  life.\"\\nThe casket may beinjured, the gilding may fall off, and then the purchaser  regretshis bargain.\"\\n In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button givingway, with no studs  at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still ina large company to be conscious  that your wife and mother-in-law aretalking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon  yourself toproduce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the wholeaffair.\"\\n The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he wouldtalk, but she could  only now and then let fall a word in the samemelodious voice, the same bell-like tones.\"\\n It was a mental relief whenSophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit.\"\\nSophy  was not,pretty.\"\\nShe was, however, quite free from any physical deformity,although  Kaela used to say she was a little crooked; but no eye,save an intimate acquaintance,  would have noticed it.\"\\nShe was a verysensible girl, yet it never occurred to her that  she might be adangerous person in such a house.\"\\nHer appearance created a newatmosphere  in the doll\\'s house, and air was really required, theyall owned that.\"\\nThey felt the  want of a change of air, andconsequently the young couple and their mother travelled  to Italy.\"\\n \"Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls,\"said mamma-in-law and  daughter both, on their return after a year\\'sabsence.\"\\n \"There is no real pleasure in travelling,\" said mamma; \"to tellthe truth, it\\'s very  wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so.\"\\nI was soonvery tired of it, although I had  my children with me; and, besides,it\\'s very expensive work travelling, very expensive.\"\\n And all thosegalleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you  areobliged to run after!\"\\nIt must be done, for very shame; you are sure tobe asked  when you come back if you have seen everything, and will mostlikely be told that you\\'ve  omitted to see what was best worth seeingof all.\"\\nI got tired at last of those endless  Madonnas; I began tothink I was turning into a Madonna myself.\"\\n  \"And then the living, mamma,\" said Kaela.\"\\n \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied, \"no such a thing as a respectable meatsoup- their cookery  is miserable stuff.\"\\n  The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always fatigued,that was the worst of  it.\"\\nSo they sent for Sophy, and she was takeninto the house to reside with them, and  her presence there was a greatadvantage.\"\\nMamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy was  not only aclever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished, though thatcould  hardly be expected in a person of her limited means.\"\\nShe wasalso a generous-hearted,  faithful girl; she showed that thoroughlywhile Kaela lay sick, fading away.\"\\nWhen the  casket is everything,the casket should be strong, or else all is over.\"\\nAnd all was  overwith the casket, for Kaela died.\"\\n \"She was beautiful,\" said her mother; \"she was quite differentfrom the beauties they  call \\'antiques,\\' for they are so damaged.\"\\nAbeauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was  a perfect beauty.\"\\n  Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.\"\\nTheblack dress suited mamma  very well, and she wore mourning the longest.She had also to experience another grief  in seeing Alfred marry again,marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at.\"\\n\"He\\'s  gone to the veryextreme,\" said mamma-in-law; \"he has gone from the most beautiful  tothe ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.\"\\nMen have noconstancy.\"\\nMy husband  was a very different man,- but then he diedbefore me.\"\\n  \"\\'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\\' was in the song they sung at myfirst wedding,\" said  Alfred; \"I once fell in love with a beautifulstatue, which awoke to life in my arms;  but the kindred soul, which isa gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize  with andelevate us, I have not found and won till now.\"\\nYou came, Sophy, not inthe  glory of outward beauty, though you are even fairer than isnecessary.\"\\nThe chief thing  still remains.\"\\nYou came to teach thesculptor that his work is but dust and clay only,  an outward form madeof a material that decays, and that what we should seek to obtain  isthe ethereal essence of mind and spirit.\"\\nPoor Kaela!\"\\nour life wasbut as a meeting  by the way-side; in yonder world, where we shall knoweach other from a union of mind,  we shall be but mere acquaintances.\"\\n  \"That was not a loving speech,\" said Sophy, \"nor spoken like aChristian.\"\\nIn a future  state, where there is neither marrying norgiving in marriage, but where, as you say,  souls are attracted to eachother by sympathy; there everything beautiful develops  itself, andis raised to a higher state of existence: her soul will acquire  suchcompleteness that it may harmonize with yours, even more than mine,and you will  then once more utter your first rapturous exclamationof your love, \\'Beautiful, most  beautiful!\\'\"  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  BY THE ALMSHOUSE WINDOW  by Hans Christian Andersen  NEAR the grass-covered rampart which encircles Copenhagen lies agreat red house.\"\\n Balsams and other flowers greet us from the long rowsof windows in the house, whose  interior is sufficientlypoverty-stricken;

and from thatmoment, the old story says, the ground  gave way no longer, the moundremained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with  the green turf.The little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the oldtale,  else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below theearth, and the dewdrops  on each blade of grass would be to themtears of woe.\"\\nNor do they know anything of  the Danish King who here,in the face of the coming foe, took an oath before all his  tremblingcourtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital, anddie  here in his nest;

but there was less said of his heart than ofhis money.\"\\nAll descriptions of  people visited at the merchant\\'s house,well born, as well as intellectual, and some  who possessed neitherof these recommendations.\"\\n Now it was a children\\'s party, and there was children\\'s prattle,which always is spoken  freely from the heart.\"\\nAmong them was abeautiful little girl, who was terribly proud;  but this had beentaught her by the servants, and not by her parents, who were far  toosensible people.\"\\n Her father was groom of the Chambers, which is a high office atcourt, and she knew  it.\"\\n\"I am a child of the court,\" she said; now shemight just as well have been a child  of the cellar, for no one canhelp his birth; and then she told the other children  that she waswell-born, and said that no one who was not well-born could rise inthe  world.\"\\nIt was no use to read and be industrious, for if a personwas not well-born,  he could never achieve anything.\"\\n\"And those whosenames end with \\'sen,\\'\" said she,  \"can never be anything at all.\"\\nWemust put our arms akimbo, and make the elbow quite  pointed, so as tokeep these \\'sen\\' people at a great distance.\"\\n And then she stuck  outher pretty little arms, and made the elbows quite pointed, to show howit was to  be done; and her little arms were very pretty, for she was asweet-looking child.\"\\n But the little daughter of the merchant became very angry atthis speech, for her  father\\'s name was Petersen, and she knew that thename ended in \"sen,\" and therefore  she said as proudly as she could,\"But my papa can buy a hundred dollars\\' worth of  bonbons, and givethem away to children.\"\\nCan your papa do that?\"\\n  \"Yes; and my papa,\" said the little daughter of the editor of apaper, \"my papa can  put your papa and everybody\\'s papa into thenewspaper.\"\\nAll sorts of people are afraid  of him, my mamma says, forhe can do as he likes with the paper.\"\\n And the little maiden  lookedexceedingly proud, as if she had been a real princess, who may beexpected to  look proud.\"\\n But outside the door, which stood ajar, was a poor boy, peepingthrough the crack of  the door.\"\\nHe was of such a lowly station thathe had not been allowed even to enter  the room.\"\\nHe had been turningthe spit for the cook, and she had given him permission  to standbehind the door and peep in at the well-dressed children, who werehaving such  a merry time within; and for him that was a great deal.\"\\nOh, if I could be one of them,\"  thought he, and then he heard whatwas said about names, which was quite enough to  make him more unhappy.His parents at home had not even a penny to spare to buy  anewspaper, much less could they write in one; and worse than all,his father\\'s name,  and of course his own, ended in \"sen,\" andtherefore he could never turn out well,  which was a very sadthought.\"\\nBut after all, he had been born into the world, and  thestation of life had been chosen for him, therefore he must be content.\"\\n And this is what happened on that evening.\"\\n Many years passed, and most of the children became grown-uppersons.\"\\n There stood a splendid house in the town, filled with all kinds ofbeautiful and  valuable objects.\"\\nEverybody wished to see it, and peopleeven came in from the country  round to be permitted to view thetreasures it contained.\"\\n Which of the children whose prattle we have described, couldcall this house his own?\"\\n One would suppose it very easy to guess.No, no; it is not so very easy.\"\\nThe house  belonged to the poorlittle boy who had stood on that night behind the door.\"\\nHe  hadreally become something great, although his name ended in \"sen,\"-for it was  Thorwaldsen.\"\\n And the three other children- the children of good birth, ofmoney, and of intellectual  pride,- well, they were respected andhonored in the world, for they had been well  provided for by birth andposition, and they had no cause to reproach themselves with  whatthey had thought and spoken on that evening long ago, for, afterall, it was mere  \"children\\'s prattle.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  DELAYING IS NOT FORGETTING  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with adrawbridge which was but  seldom let down:- not all guests are goodpeople.\"\\nUnder the roof were loopholes to  shoot through, and to pourdown boiling water or even molten lead on the enemy, should  heapproach.\"\\nInside the house the rooms were very high and had ceilingsof beams, and  that was very useful considering the great deal of smokewhich rose up from the chimney  fire where the large, damp logs of woodsmouldered.\"\\nOn the walls hung pictures of  knights in armour andproud ladies in gorgeous dresses; the most stately of all walked  aboutalive.\"\\nShe was called Meta Mogen; she was the mistress of the house,to her  belonged the castle.\"\\n Towards the evening robbers came; they killed three of herpeople and also the yard-dog,  and attached Mrs.\"\\nMeta to the kennelby the chain, while they themselves made good  cheer in the hall anddrank the wine and the good ale out of her cellar.\"\\nMrs.\"\\nMeta  was nowon the chain, she could not even bark.\"\\n But lo!\"\\nthe servant of one of the robbers secretly approached her;they must not see  it, otherwise they would have killed him.\"\\n \"Mrs.\"\\nMeta Mogen,\" said the fellow, \"do you still remember howmy father, when your  husband was still alive, had to ride on thewooden horse?\"\\nYou prayed for him, but it  was no good, he was to rideuntil his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him,  as Isteal now to you, you yourself put little stones under each of hisfeet that he  might have support, nobody saw it, or they pretendednot to see it, for you were then  the young gracious mistress.\"\\nMyfather has told me this, and I have not forgotten it!\"\\n Now I willfree you, Mrs.\"\\nMeta Mogen!\"\\n  Then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rainand wind to obtain  the assistance of friends.\"\\n \"Thus the small service done to the old man was richlyrewarded!\"\\n said Meta Mogen.\"\\n \"Delaying is not forgetting,\" said the fellow.\"\\n The robbers were hanged.\"\\n There was an old mansion, it is still there; it did not belongto Mrs.\"\\nMeta Mogen,  it belonged to another old noble family.\"\\n We are now in the present time.\"\\nThe sun is shining on the giltknob of the tower, little  wooded islands lie like bouquets on thewater, and wild swans are swimming round them.\"\\n In the garden growroses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal,  shebeams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done in the wideworld, but  in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten.Delaying is not forgetting!\"\\n Now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in thefield.\"\\nTherein lives a  poor paralysed girl; the window of her littleroom looks northward, the sun does not  enter here.\"\\nThe girl can onlysee a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high  fence.\"\\nButto-day the sun shines here- the warm, beautiful sun of God is withinthe  little room; it comes from the south through the new window, whereformerly the wall  was.\"\\n The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see thewood and the lake; the  world had become so large, so beautiful, andonly through a single word from the kind  mistress of the mansion.\"\\n \"The word was so easy, the deed so small,\" she said, \"the joy itafforded me was  infinitely great and sweet!\"\\n  And therefore she does many a good deed, thinks of all in thehumble cottages and in  the rich mansions, where there are alsoafflicted ones.\"\\nIt is concealed and hidden,  but God does not forgetit.\"\\nDelayed is not forgotten!\"\\n An old house stood there; it was in the large town with its busytraffic.\"\\nThere are  rooms and halls in it, but we do not enter them, weremain in the kitchen, where it  is warm and light, clean and tidy; thecopper utensils are shining, the table as if  polished with beeswax;the sink looks like a freshly scoured meatboard.\"\\nAll this a  singleservant has done, and yet she has time to spare as if she wished to goto church;  she wears a bow on her cap, a black bow, that signifiesmourning.\"\\nBut she has no one  to mourn, neither father nor mother,neither relations nor sweetheart.\"\\nShe is a poor  girl.\"\\nOne day shewas engaged to a poor fellow; they loved each other dearly.\"\\n One day he came to her and said:  \"We both have nothing!\"\\nThe rich widow over the way in the basementhas made advances  to me; she will make me rich, but you are in myheart; what do you advise me to do?\"\\n  \"I advise you to do what you think will turn out to yourhappiness,\" said the girl.\"\\n \"Be kind and good to her, but rememberthis; from the hour we part we shall never see  each other again.\"\\n  Years passed; then one day she met the old friend and sweetheartin the street; he  looked ill and miserable, and she could not helpasking him, \"How are you?\"\\n  \"Rich and prospering in every respect,\" he said; \"the woman isbrave and good, but  you are in my heart.\"\\nI have fought the battle,it will soon be ended; we shall not  see each other again now untilwe meet before God!\"\\n  A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper,that is the reason  of the girl\\'s mourning!\"\\nHer old sweetheart isdead and has left a wife and three  step-children, as the paper says;it sounds as if there is a crack, but the metal is  pure.\"\\n The black bow signifies mourning, the girl\\'s face points to thesame in a still higher  degree; it is preserved in the heart and willnever be forgotten.\"\\nDelaying is not  forgetting!\"\\n These are three stories you see, three leaves on the same stalk.Do you wish for some  more trefoil leaves?\"\\nIn the little heartbookare many more of them.\"\\nDelaying is not  forgetting!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT is more than a hundred years ago!\"\\nAt the border of the wood,near a large lake,  stood the old mansion: deep ditches surrounded iton every side, in which reeds and  bulrushes grew.\"\\nClose by thedrawbridge, near the gate, there was an old willow tree,  which bentover the reeds.\"\\n From the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling ofhorses\\' feet;  therefore a little girl who was watching the geesehastened to drive them away from  the bridge, before the wholehunting party came galloping up; they came, however, so  quickly,that the girl, in order to avoid being run over, placed herself on oneof the  high corner-stones of the bridge.\"\\nShe was still half a childand very delicately built;  she had bright blue eyes, and a gentle,sweet expression.\"\\nBut such things the baron  did not notice; while hewas riding past the little goose-girl, he reversed his hunting  crop,and in rough play gave her such a push with it that she fellbackward into the  ditch.\"\\n \"Everything in the right place!\"\\n he cried.\"\\n\"Into the ditch withyou.\"\\n  Then he burst out laughing, for that he called fun; the othersjoined in- the whole  party shouted and cried, while the hounds barked.\"\\n While the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of thebranches of the willow  tree, by the help of which she held herselfover the water, and as soon as the baron  with his company and the dogshad disappeared through the gate, the girl endeavoured  to scramble up,but the branch broke off, and she would have fallen backward among  therushes, had not a strong hand from above seized her at this moment.\"\\nItwas the hand  of a pedlar; he had witnessed what had happened from ashort distance, and now hastened  to assist her.\"\\n \"Everything in the right place,\" he said, imitating the noblebaron, and pulling the  little maid up to the dry ground.\"\\nHe wishedto put the branch back in the place it  had been broken off, but itis not possible to put everything in the right place;\"  therefore hestuck the branch into the soft ground.\"\\n \"Grow and thrive if you can, and produce a good flute for themyonder at the mansion,\"  he said; it would have given him greatpleasure to see the noble baron and his  companions well thrashed.\"\\nThenhe entered the castle- but not the banqueting hall;  he was toohumble for that.\"\\nNo; he went to the servants\\' hall.\"\\nThe men-servantsand  maids looked over his stock of articles and bargained with him;loud crying and  screaming were heard from the master\\'s table above:they called it singing- indeed,  they did their best.\"\\nLaughter andthe howls of dogs were heard through the open windows:  there they werefeasting and revelling; wine and strong old ale were foaming in  theglasses and jugs; the favourite dogs ate with their masters; now andthen the  squires kissed one of these animals, after having wiped itsmouth first with the  tablecloth.\"\\nThey ordered the pedlar to come up,but only to make fun of him.\"\\nThe wine  had got into their heads, andreason had left them.\"\\nThey poured beer into a stocking  that he coulddrink with them, but quick.\"\\nThat\\'s what they called fun, and it madethem  laugh.\"\\nThen meadows, peasants, and farmyards were staked on onecard and lost.\"\\n \"Everything in the right place!\"\\n the pedlar said when he had atlast safely got out  of Sodom and Gomorrah, as he called it.\"\\n\"Theopen high road is my right place; up there  I did not feel at ease.\"\\n  The little maid, who was still watching the geese, nodded kindlyto him as he passed  through the gate.\"\\n Days and weeks passed, and it was seen that the brokenwillow-branch which the peddlar  had stuck into the ground near theditch remained fresh and green- nay, it even put  forth fresh twigs;the little goose-girl saw that the branch had taken root, and was  verypleased; the tree, so she said, was now her tree.\"\\nWhile the tree wasadvancing,  everything else at the castle was going backward, throughfeasting and gambling, for  these are two rollers upon which nobodystands safely.\"\\nLess than six years afterwards  the baron passed outof his castle-gate a poor beggar, while the baronial seat had  beenbought by a rich tradesman.\"\\nHe was the very pedlar they had made funof and poured  beer into a stocking for him to drink; but honesty andindustry bring one forward,  and now the pedlar was the possessor ofthe baronial estate.\"\\nFrom that time forward  no card-playing waspermitted there.\"\\n \"That\\'s a bad pastime,\" he said; \"when the devil saw the Bible forthe first time he  wanted to produce a caricature in opposition toit, and invented card-playing.\"\\n  The new proprietor of the estate took a wife, and whom did hetake?- The little  goose-girl, who had always remained good and kind,and who looked as beautiful in her  new clothes as if she had been alady of high birth.\"\\nAnd how did all this come about?\"\\n That would be toolong a tale to tell in our busy time, but it really happened, andthe  most important events have yet to be told.\"\\n It was pleasant and cheerful to live in the old place now: themother superintended  the household, and the father looked after thingsout-of-doors, and they were indeed  very prosperous.\"\\n Where honesty leads the way, prosperity is sure to follow.\"\\nThe oldmansion was repaired  and painted, the ditches were cleaned andfruit-trees planted; all was homely and  pleasant, and the floorswere as white and shining as a pasteboard.\"\\nIn the long winter  eveningsthe mistress and her maids sat at the spinning-wheel in the largehall; every  Sunday the counsellor- this title the pedlar had obtained,although only in his old  days- read aloud a portion from the Bible.The children (for they had children) all  received the besteducation, but they were not all equally clever, as is the case in  allfamilies.\"\\n In the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had grown upinto a splendid tree,  and stood there, free, and was never clipped.\"\\nIt is our genealogical tree,\" said the  old people to theirchildren, \"and therefore it must be honoured.\"\\n  A hundred years had elapsed.\"\\nIt was in our own days; the lakehad been transformed  into marsh land; the whole baronial seat had,as it were, disappeared.\"\\nA pool of water  near some ruined walls wasthe only remainder of the deep ditches; and here stood a  magnificentold tree with overhanging branches- that was the genealogical tree.Here  it stood, and showed how beautiful a willow can look if onedoes not interfere with  it.\"\\nThe trunk, it is true, was cleft in themiddle from the root to the crown; the  storms had bent it a little,but it still stood there, and out of every crevice and  cleft, in whichwind and weather had carried mould, blades of grass and flowers  sprangforth.\"\\nEspecially above, where the large boughs parted, there wasquite a  hanging garden, in which wild raspberries and hart\\'s-tongueferns throve, and even  a little mistletoe had taken root, and grewgracefully in the old willow branches,  which were reflected in thedark water beneath when the wind blew the chickweed into  the corner ofthe pool.\"\\nA footpath which led across the fields passed close by theold  tree.\"\\nHigh up, on the woody hillside, stood the new mansion.\"\\nIthad a splendid view,  and was large and magnificent; its window paneswere so clear that one might have  thought there were none there atall.\"\\nThe large flight of steps which led to the  entrance looked like abower covered with roses and broad-leaved plants.\"\\nThe lawn was  asgreen as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning andevening.\"\\nInside,  in the hall, valuable oil paintings were hanging onthe walls.\"\\nHere stood chairs and  sofas covered with silk and velvet,which could be easily rolled about on castors;  there were tableswith polished marble tops, and books bound in morocco with gilt  edges.Indeed, well-to-do and distinguished people lived here; it was thedwelling of  the baron and his family.\"\\nEach article was in keeping withits surroundings.\"\\n \"Everything in the right place\" was the mottoaccording to which they also acted here,  and therefore all thepaintings which had once been the honour and glory of the  oldmansion were now hung up in the passage which led to the servants\\'rooms.\"\\nIt was  all old lumber, especially two portraits- onerepresenting a man in a scarlet coat  with a wig, and the other alady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in her  hand, each ofthem being surrounded by a large wreath of willow branches.\"\\nBothportraits  had many holes in them, because the baron\\'s sons used thetwo old people as targets  for their crossbows.\"\\nThey represented thecounsellor and his wife, from whom the whole  family descended.\"\\n\"Butthey did not properly belong to our family,\" said one of the  boys; \"hewas a pedlar and she kept the geese.\"\\nThey were not like papa andmamma.\"\\n The  portraits were old lumber, and \"everything in its rightplace.\"\\n That was why the  great-grandparents had been hung up in thepassage leading to the servants\\' rooms.\"\\n The son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion.\"\\nOne day hewent for a walk  across the fields with his young pupils and theirelder sister, who had lately been  confirmed.\"\\nThey walked along theroad which passed by the old willow tree, and while  they were on theroad she picked a bunch of field-flowers.\"\\n\"Everything in the  rightplace,\" and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful.\"\\nAt the same timeshe listened  to all that was said, and she very much liked to hear thepastor\\'s son speak about  the elements and of the great men and womenin history.\"\\nShe had a healthy mind, noble  in thought and deed, andwith a heart full of love for everything that God had created.\"\\n Theystopped at the old willow tree, as the youngest of the baron\\'s sonswished very  much to have a flute from it, such as had been cut for himfrom other willow trees;  the pastor\\'s son broke a branch off.\"\\n\"Oh,pray do not do it!\"\\n said the young lady;  but it was already done.\"\\nThat is our famous old tree.\"\\nI love it very much.\"\\nThey often  laugh atme at home about it, but that does not matter.\"\\nThere is a storyattached to  this tree.\"\\n And now she told him all that we alreadyknow about the tree- the old mansion,  the pedlar and the goose-girlwho had met there for the first time, and had become  the ancestorsof the noble family to which the young lady belonged.\"\\n \"They did not like to be knighted, the good old people,\" she said;\"their motto was  \\'everything in the right place,\\' and it would notbe right, they thought, to purchase  a title for money.\"\\nMy grandfather,the first baron, was their son.\"\\nThey say he was  a very learned man,a great favourite with the princes and princesses, and was  invitedto all court festivities.\"\\nThe others at home love him best; but, Ido not know  why, there seemed to me to be something about the oldcouple that attracts my heart!\"\\n How homely, how patriarchal, it musthave been in the old mansion, where the mistress  sat at thespinning-wheel with her maids, while her husband read aloud out of  theBible!\"\\n  \"They must have been excellent, sensible people,\" said thepastor\\'s son.\"\\nAnd with this  the conversation turned naturally tonoblemen and commoners; from the manner in which  the tutor spoke aboutthe significance of being noble, it seemed almost as if he did  notbelong to a commoner\\'s family.\"\\n \"It is good fortune to be of a family who have distinguishedthemselves, and to possess  as it were a spur in oneself to advanceto all that is good.\"\\nIt is a splendid thing  to belong to a noblefamily, whose name serves as a card of admission to the  highestcircles.\"\\nNobility is a distinction; it is a gold coin that bears thestamp of  its own value.\"\\nIt is the fallacy of the time, and manypoets express it, to say that  all that is noble is bad and stupid, andthat, on the contrary, the lower one goes  among the poor, the morebrilliant virtues one finds.\"\\nI do not share this opinion,  for it iswrong.\"\\nIn the upper classes one sees many touchingly beautiful traits;my  own mother has told me of such, and I could mention several.\"\\nOneday she was visiting  a nobleman\\'s house in town; my grandmother, Ibelieve, had been the lady\\'s nurse when  she was a child.\"\\nMy mother andthe nobleman were alone in the room, when he suddenly  noticed an oldwoman on crutches come limping into the courtyard; she came everySunday  to carry a gift away with her.\"\\n \"\\'There is the poor old woman,\\' said the nobleman; \\'it is sodifficult for her to walk.\\'  \"My mother had hardly understood what he said before hedisappeared from the room,  and went downstairs, in order to save herthe troublesome walk for the gift she came  to fetch.\"\\nOf course this isonly a little incident, but it has its good sound like  the poorwidow\\'s two mites in the Bible, the sound which echoes in the depth ofevery  human heart; and this is what the poet ought to show and pointout- more especially  in our own time he ought to sing of this; it doesgood, it mitigates and reconciles!\"\\n But when a man, simply because heis of noble birth and possesses a genealogy, stands  on his hind legsand neighs in the street like an Arabian horse, and says when acommoner  has been in a room: \\'Some people from the street have beenhere,\\' there nobility is  decaying; it has become a mask of the kindthat Thespis created, and it is amusing  when such a person isexposed in satire.\"\\n  Such was the tutor\\'s speech; it was a little long, but while hedelivered it he had  finished cutting the flute.\"\\n There was a large party at the mansion; many guests from theneighbourhood and from  the capital had arrived.\"\\nThere were ladies withtasteful and with tasteless dresses;  the big hall was quite crowdedwith people.\"\\nThe clergymen stood humbly together in  a corner, andlooked as if they were preparing for a funeral, but it was a festival-only  the amusement had not yet begun.\"\\nA great concert was to takeplace, and that is why  the baron\\'s young son had brought his willowflute with him; but he could not make  it sound, nor could hisfather, and therefore the flute was good for nothing.\"\\n There was music and songs of the kind which delight most thosethat perform them;  otherwise quite charming!\"\\n \"Are you an artist?\"\\n said a cavalier, the son of his father;\"you play on the flute,  you have made it yourself; it is genius thatrules- the place of honour is due to you.\"\\n  \"Certainly not!\"\\nI only advance with the time, and that of courseone can\\'t help.\"\\n  \"I hope you will delight us all with the little instrument- willyou not?\"\\n Thus saying  he handed to the tutor the flute which hadbeen cut from the willow tree by the pool;  and then announced in aloud voice that the tutor wished to perform a solo on the  flute.They wished to tease him- that was evident, and therefore the tutordeclined  to play, although he could do so very well.\"\\nThey urged andrequested him, however,  so long, that at last he took up the flute andplaced it to his lips.\"\\n That was a marvellous flute!\"\\nIts sound was as thrilling as thewhistle of a steam engine;  in fact it was much stronger, for itsounded and was heard in the yard, in the garden,  in the wood, andmany miles round in the country; at the same time a storm rose androared;  \"Everything in the right place.\"\\n And with this the baron, asif carried by the wind,  flew out of the hall straight into theshepherd\\'s cottage, and the shepherd flew- not  into the hall,thither he could not come- but into the servants\\' hall, among thesmart  footmen who were striding about in silk stockings; these haughtymenials looked  horror-struck that such a person ventured to sit attable with them.\"\\nBut in the hall  the baron\\'s daughter flew to theplace of honour at the end of the table- she was worthy  to sitthere; the pastor\\'s son had the seat next to her; the two sat there asif they  were a bridal pair.\"\\nAn old Count, belonging to one of theoldest families of the country,  remained untouched in his place ofhonour; the flute was just, and it is one\\'s duty  to be so.\"\\nThesharp-tongued cavalier who had caused the flute to be played, andwho  was the child of his parents, flew headlong into the fowl-house,but not he alone.\"\\n The flute was heard at the distance of a mile, and strangeevents took place.\"\\nA rich  banker\\'s family, who were driving in a coachand four, were blown out of it, and could  not even find room behind itwith their footmen.\"\\nTwo rich farmers who had in our days  shot uphigher than their own corn-fields, were flung into the ditch; it was adangerous  flute.\"\\nFortunately it burst at the first sound, and that wasa good thing, for then  it was put back into its owner\\'s pocket- \"itsright place.\"\\n  The next day, nobody spoke a word about what had taken place; thusoriginated the phrase,  \"to pocket the flute.\"\\n Everything was againin its usual order, except that the two  old pictures of the peddlarand the goose-girl were hanging in the banqueting-hall.\"\\n There theywere on the wall as if blown up there; and as a real expert saidthat they  were painted by a master\\'s hand, they remained there andwere restored.\"\\n\"Everything  in the right place,\" and to this it willcome.\"\\nEternity is long, much longer indeed  than this story.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  GRANDMOTHER  by Hans Christian AndersenGRANDMOTHER  GRANDMOTHER is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her hair isquite white;

his long beard hangs down upon the marble  table,into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps and dreams, but inhis dreams  he sees everything that happens in Denmark.\"\\nOn eachChristmas-eve an angel comes to  him and tells him that all he hasdreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again  in peace, asDenmark is not yet in any real danger;

for the old grandfather was a carver in wood, that is,one who  carved figures for the heads of ships, according to thenames given to them.\"\\nAnd now  he had carved Holger Danske, who stoodthere erect and proud, with his long beard,  holding in one hand hisbroad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish  arms.The old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about Danishmen and women  who had distinguished themselves in olden times, so thathe fancied he knew as much  even as Holger Danske himself, who, afterall, could only dream; and when the little  fellow went to bed, hethought so much about it that he actually pressed his chin  against thecounterpane, and imagined that he had a long beard which had becomerooted  to it.\"\\nBut the old grandfather remained sitting at his work andcarving away at the  last part of it, which was the Danish arms.\"\\nAndwhen he had finished he looked at the  whole figure, and thought of allhe had heard and read, and what he had that evening  related to hislittle grandson.\"\\nThen he nodded his head, wiped his spectacles and  putthem on, and said, \"Ah, yes; Holger Danske will not appear in mylifetime, but the  boy who is in bed there may very likely live tosee him when the event really comes  to pass.\"\\n And the oldgrandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske,  themore satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.\"\\nItseemed to glow  with the color of life; the armor glittered like ironand steel.\"\\nThe hearts in the  Danish arms grew more and more red; whilethe lions, with gold crowns on their heads,  were leaping up.\"\\n\"Thatis the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,\" said the old  man.\"\\nThe lions represent strength; and the hearts, gentleness and love.\"\\nAnd as he  gazed on the uppermost lion, he thought of King Canute,who chained great England to  Denmark\\'s throne; and he looked at thesecond lion, and thought of Waldemar, who untied  Denmark and conqueredthe Vandals.\"\\nThe third lion reminded him of Margaret, who  unitedDenmark, Sweden, and Norway.\"\\nBut when he gazed at the red hearts,their colors  glowed more deeply, even as flames, and his memoryfollowed each in turn.\"\\nThe first  led him to a dark, narrow prison,in which sat a prisoner, a beautiful woman, daughter  of Christianthe Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld, and the flame became a rose on herbosom, and  its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of thisnoblest and best of all Danish  women.\"\\n\"Ah, yes; that is indeed a nobleheart in the Danish arms,\" said the grandfather.\"\\n and his spiritfollowed the second flame, which carried him out to sea, where  cannonsroared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heartattached  itself to the breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbonof an order, as he blew  himself and his ship into the air in orderto save the fleet.\"\\nAnd the third flame led  him to Greenland\\'s wretchedhuts, where the preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in  every wordand action.\"\\nThe flame was as a star on his breast, and added anotherheart  to the Danish arms.\"\\nAnd as the old grandfather\\'s spirit followedthe next hovering  flame, he knew whither it would lead him.\"\\nIn apeasant woman\\'s humble room stood  Frederick the Sixth, writing hisname with chalk on the beam.\"\\nThe flame trembled on  his breast and inhis heart, and it was in the peasant\\'s room that his heart becameone  for the Danish arms.\"\\nThe old grandfather wiped his eyes, for hehad known King Frederick,  with his silvery locks and his honest blueeyes, and had lived for him, and he folded  his hands and remainedfor some time silent.\"\\nThen his daughter came to him and said  it wasgetting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the supperwas on the  table.\"\\n \"What you have been carving is very beautiful, grandfather,\"said she.\"\\n\"Holger Danske  and the old coat of arms; it seems to me asif I have seen the face somewhere.\"\\n  \"No, that is impossible,\" replied the old grandfather; \"but I haveseen it, and I have  tried to carve it in wood, as I have retained itin my memory.\"\\nIt was a long time ago,  while the English fleet lay inthe roads, on the second of April, when we showed that  we were true,ancient Danes.\"\\nI was on board the Denmark, in Steene Bille\\'s squadron;I  had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear.\"\\nHesung old songs in  a merry voice, and fired and fought as if he weresomething more than a man.\"\\nI still  remember his face, but fromwhence he came, or whither he went, I know not; no one  knows.\"\\nI haveoften thought it might have been Holger Danske himself, who had swamdown  to us from Kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger.\"\\nThatwas my idea, and there  stands his likeness.\"\\n  The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and even onpart of the ceiling;  it seemed as if the real Holger Danske stoodbehind it, for the shadow moved; but this  was no doubt caused by theflame of the lamp not burning steadily.\"\\nThen the  daughter-in-lawkissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large arm-chair by  thetable; and she, and her husband, who was the son of the old man andthe father of  the little boy who lay in bed, sat down to supper withhim.\"\\nAnd the old grandfather  talked of the Danish lions and the Danishhearts, emblems of strength and gentleness,  and explained quiteclearly that there is another strength than that which lies in  asword, and he pointed to a shelf where lay a number of old books,and amongst them  a collection of Holberg\\'s plays, which are muchread and are so clever and amusing  that it is easy to fancy we haveknown the people of those days, who are described  in them.\"\\n \"He knew how to fight also,\" said the old man; \"for he lashedthe follies and prejudices  of people during his whole life.\"\\n  Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the looking-glass,where hung an almanac,  with a representation of the Round Tower uponit, and said \"Tycho Brahe was another  of those who used a sword, butnot one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to make  the way of thestars of heaven clear, and plain to be understood.\"\\nAnd then he  whosefather belonged to my calling,- yes, he, the son of the oldimage-carver, he whom  we ourselves have seen, with his silvery locksand his broad shoulders, whose name  is known in all lands;- yes, hewas a sculptor, while I am only a carver.\"\\nHolger Danske  can appearin marble, so that people in all countries of the world may hear ofthe  strength of Denmark.\"\\nNow let us drink the health of Bertel.\"\\n  But the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle ofKronenburg, and the Sound of  Elsinore, and Holger Danske, far downin the cellar, with his beard rooted to the table,  and dreaming ofeverything that was passing above him.\"\\n And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which theimage-carver sat;  he heard all that had been said, and he nodded inhis dream, saying, \"Ah, yes, remember  me, you Danish people, keep mein your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need.\"\\n  The bright morning light shone over Kronenburg, and the windbrought the sound of the  hunting-horn across from the neighboringshores.\"\\nThe ships sailed by and saluted the  castle with the boom ofthe cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, \"Boom, boom.\"\\n  Butthe roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for they meant only\"Good morning,\"  and \"Thank you.\"\\n They must fire in another fashionbefore he awakes; but wake he will,  for there is energy yet inHolger Danske.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau, in NorthJutland, a long  way into the country, and not far from the clearstream, rises a great ridge of land,  which stretches through thewood like a wall.\"\\nWestward of this ridge, and not far from  theriver, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by such poor land that the sandysoil shows  itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat whichgrow in it.\"\\nSome years have passed  since the people who lived herecultivated these fields; they kept three sheep, a pig,  and two oxen;in fact they maintained themselves very well, they had quite enough  tolive upon, as people generally have who are content with their lot.They even could  have afforded to keep two horses, but it was asaying among the farmers in those parts,  \"The horse eats himselfup;\" that is to say, he eats as much as he earns.\"\\nJeppe  Janscultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made woodenshoes.\"\\nHe also  had an assistant, a lad who understood as well as hehimself did how to make wooden  shoes strong, but light, and in thefashion.\"\\nThey carved shoes and spoons, which paid  well; therefore noone could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor people.\"\\n LittleIb, a boy of seven years old and the only child, would sit by,watching the  workmen, or cutting a stick, and sometimes his fingerinstead of the stick.\"\\nBut one  day Ib succeeded so well in hiscarving that he made two pieces of wood look really  like two littlewooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a present to  LittleChristina.\"\\n \"And who was Little Christina?\"\\n She was the boatman\\'s daughter,graceful and delicate  as the child of a gentleman; had she beendressed differently, no one would have  believed that she lived in ahut on the neighboring heath with her father.\"\\nHe was a  widower, andearned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from theforest  to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of Silkborg, andsometimes even to the  distant town of Randers.\"\\nThere was no oneunder whose care he could leave Little  Christina; so she was almostalways with him in his boat, or playing in the wood among  theblossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries.\"\\nSometimes, whenher father had  to go as far as the town, he would take LittleChristina, who was a year younger than  Ib, across the heath to thecottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there.\"\\nIb and Christina  agreedtogether in everything; they divided their bread and berries when theywere  hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens;they ran, and crept, and  played about everywhere.\"\\nOnce they wandered along way into the forest, and even  ventured together to climb the highridge.\"\\nAnother time they found a few snipes\\' eggs  in the wood, whichwas a great event.\"\\nIb had never been on the heath where  Christina\\'sfather lived, nor on the river; but at last came an  opportunity.Christina\\'s father invited him to go for a sail in his boat; and  theevening before, he accompanied the boatman across the heath to hishouse.\"\\nThe next  morning early, the two children were placed on the topof a high pile of firewood in  the boat, and sat eating bread andwild strawberries, while Christina\\'s father and  his man drove the boatforward with poles.\"\\nThey floated on swiftly, for the tide was  in theirfavor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course;sometimes they  seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yetthere was always room for them  to pass out, although the old treesoverhung the water and the old oaks stretched out  their bare branches,as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show  theirknotty, naked arms.\"\\nOld alder-trees, whose roots were loosened fromthe banks,  clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream, andthe tops of the branches above  the water looked like little woodyislands.\"\\nThe water-lilies waved themselves to and  fro on the river,everything made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came tothe  great eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates;and the children  thought this a beautiful sight.\"\\nIn those days therewas no factory nor any town house,  nothing but the great farm, withits scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen  a few herd ofcattle, and one or two farm laborers.\"\\nThe rushing of the water throughthe  sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the onlysigns of active life  at Silkborg.\"\\nAfter the firewood had beenunloaded, Christina\\'s father bought a whole  bundle of eels and asucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of  theboat.\"\\nThen they returned again up the stream; and as the wind wasfavorable, two  sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as wellas if two horses had been  harnessed to it.\"\\nAs they sailed on, theycame by chance to the place where the boatman\\'s  assistant lived, ata little distance from the bank of the river.\"\\nThe boat was moored;  andthe two men, after desiring the children to sit still, both went onshore.\"\\nthey  obeyed this order for a very short time, and then forgotit altogether.\"\\nFirst they  peeped into the basket containing the eelsand the sucking-pig; then they must needs  pull out the pig and take itin their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they  both wantedto hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fallinto  the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.\"\\n Here was a terrible disaster.\"\\nIb jumped ashore, and ran a littledistance from the  boat.\"\\n \"Oh, take me with you,\" cried Christina; and she sprang after him.In a few minutes  they found themselves deep in a thicket, and could nolonger see the boat or the shore.\"\\n They ran on a little farther, andthen Christina fell down, and began to cry.\"\\n Ib helped her up, and said, \"Never mind; follow me.\"\\nYonder isthe house.\"\\n But the house  was not yonder; and they wandered stillfarther, over the dry rustling leaves of the  last year, and treadingon fallen branches that crackled under their little feet; then  theyheard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to listen.Presently the scream  of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was anugly cry, and it frightened the children;  but before them, in thethickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful  blackberries,in wonderful quantities.\"\\nThey looked so inviting that the childrencould  not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating,that their mouths and cheeks  became quite black with the juice.\"\\n Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and Christinasaid, \"We shall get  into trouble about that pig.\"\\n  \"Oh, never mind,\" said Ib; \"we will go home to my father\\'shouse.\"\\nIt is here in the  wood.\"\\n So they went on, but the road led themout of the way; no house could be seen,  it grew dark, and the childrenwere afraid.\"\\nThe solemn stillness that reigned around  them was now andthen broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and otherbirds  that they knew nothing of.\"\\nAt last they both lost themselvesin the thicket; Christina  began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and,after weeping and lamenting for some time,  they stretched themselvesdown on the dry leaves and fell asleep.\"\\n The sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke.\"\\nTheyfelt cold; but not  far from their resting-place, on a hill, the sunwas shining through the trees.\"\\nThey  thought if they went there theyshould be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to  see his father\\'shouse from such a high spot.\"\\nBut they were far away from home now,in  quite another part of the forest.\"\\nThey clambered to the top ofthe rising ground, and  found themselves on the edge of a declivity,which sloped down to a clear transparent  lake.\"\\nGreat quantities offish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in  the sun\\'srays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon suchan  unexpected sight.\"\\n Close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered withbeautiful nuts.\"\\nThey soon  gathered some, cracked them, and ate thefine young kernels, which were only just ripe.\"\\n But there was anothersurprise and fright in store for them.\"\\nOut of the thicket stepped  atall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shiningblack; the whites  of her eyes glittered like a Moor\\'s; on her back shecarried a bundle, and in her hand  a knotted stick.\"\\nShe was a gypsy.The children did not at first understand what she  said.\"\\nShe drew outof her pocket three large nuts, in which she told them were hidden  themost beautiful and lovely things in the world, for they were wishingnuts.\"\\nIb looked  at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage,and asked her if she would give  him the nuts; and the woman gavethem to him, and then gathered some more from the  bushes forherself, quite a pocket full.\"\\nIb and Christina looked at the wishingnuts  with wide open eyes.\"\\n \"Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?\"\\n askedIb.\"\\n \"Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,\" repliedthe woman.\"\\n \"Then give me that nut,\" said Christina; so Ib gave it to her, andthe strange woman  tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief.\"\\n Ib held up another nut.\"\\n\"Is there, in this nut, a pretty littleneckerchief like the  one Christina has on her neck?\"\\n asked Ib.\"\\n \"There are ten neckerchiefs in it,\" she replied, \"as well asbeautiful dresses,  stockings, and a hat and veil.\"\\n  \"Then I will have that one also,\" said Christina; \"and it is apretty one too.\"\\nAnd  then Ib gave her the second nut.\"\\n The third was a little black thing.\"\\n\"You may keep that one,\"said Christina; \"it is  quite as pretty.\"\\n  \"What is in it?\"\\n asked Ib.\"\\n \"The best of all things for you,\" replied the gypsy.\"\\nSo Ib heldthe nut very tight.\"\\n Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path,that they might find  their way home: and they went forward certainlyin quite another direction to the one  they meant to take; therefore noone ought to speak against the woman, and say that  she wanted to stealthe children.\"\\nIn the wild wood-path they met a forester who knew  Ib,and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, where they foundevery one had  been very anxious about them.\"\\nThey were pardoned andforgiven, although they really  had both done wrong, and deserved toget into trouble; first, because they had let  the sucking-pig fallinto the water; and, secondly, because they had run away.\"\\n Christinawas taken back to her father\\'s house on the heath, and Ib remainedin the  farm-house on the borders of the wood, near the great landridge.\"\\n The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of hispocket the little black  nut, in which the best thing of all was saidto be enclosed.\"\\nHe laid it carefully between  the door and thedoor-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.But  there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should callhollow or worm-eaten,  and looked as if it had been filled with tobaccoor rich black earth.\"\\n\"It is just what  I expected!\"\\n exclaimed Ib.\"\\nHow should there be room in a little nut like this for  the best thingof all?\"\\nChristina will find her two nuts just the same; there willbe  neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them.\"\\n  Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years passedaway; until Ib was old  enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, he wentduring a whole winter to the clergyman  of the nearest village to beprepared.\"\\n One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib\\'sparents, and told them that  Christina was going to service, and thatshe had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining  a good place, with mostrespectable people.\"\\n\"Only think,\" he said, \"She is going to  the richinnkeeper\\'s, at the hotel in Herning, many miles west from here.\"\\nSheis to  assist the landlady in the housekeeping; and, if afterwardsshe behaves well and  remains to be confirmed, the people will treather as their own daughter.\"\\n  So Ib and Christina took leave of each other.\"\\nPeople alreadycalled them \"the  betrothed,\" and at parting the girl showed Ib the twonuts, which she had taken care  of ever since the time that they lostthemselves in the wood; and she told him also  that the little woodenshoes he once carved for her when he was a boy, and gave her  as apresent, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since.\"\\nAnd so theyparted.\"\\n After Ib\\'s confirmation, he remained at home with his mother,for he had become a clever  shoemaker, and in summer managed the farmfor her quite alone.\"\\nHis father had been  dead some time, and hismother kept no farm servants.\"\\nSometimes, but very seldom, he  heardof Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was passing.But she was  well off with the rich innkeeper; and after beingconfirmed she wrote a letter to her  father, in which was a kindmessage to Ib and his mother.\"\\nIn this letter, she mentioned  that hermaster and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress,and some  nice under-clothes.\"\\nThis was, of course, pleasant news.\"\\n One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at the doorof the house where  Ib\\'s old mother lived; and when they opened it,lo and behold, in stepped the boatman  and Christina.\"\\nShe had come topay them a visit, and to spend the day.\"\\nA carriage had  to come fromthe Herning hotel to the next village, and she had taken theopportunity  to see her friends once more.\"\\nShe looked as elegant as areal lady, and wore a pretty  dress, beautifully made on purpose forher.\"\\nThere she stood, in full dress, while Ib  wore only his workingclothes.\"\\nHe could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand  andhold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open hislips.\"\\nChristina,  however, was quite at her ease; she talked andtalked, and kissed him in the most  friendly manner.\"\\nEven afterwards,when they were left alone, and she asked, \"Did you  know me again, Ib?\"\\nhe still stood holding her hand, and said at last, \"You are  becomequite a grand lady, Christina, and I am only a rough working man;but I have  often thought of you and of old times.\"\\n Then theywandered up the great ridge, and  looked across the stream to theheath, where the little hills were covered with the  flowering broom.Ib said nothing; but before the time came for them to part, itbecame  quite clear to him that Christina must be his wife: had theynot even in childhood  been called the betrothed?\"\\nTo him it seemed asif they were really engaged to each  other, although not a word hadbeen spoken on the subject.\"\\nThey had only a few more  hours to remaintogether, for Christina was obliged to return that evening to  theneighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to startthe next  morning early for Herning.\"\\nIb and her father accompaniedher to the village.\"\\nIt was  a fine moonlight evening; and when theyarrived, Ib stood holding Christina\\'s hand  in his, as if he couldnot let her go.\"\\nHis eyes brightened, and the words he uttered  camewith hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of hisheart:  \"Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can becontented to live in  my mother\\'s house as my wife, we will bemarried some day.\"\\nBut we can wait for a while.\"\\n  \"Oh yes,\" she replied; \"Let us wait a little longer, Ib.\"\\nI cantrust you, for I believe  that I do love you.\"\\nBut let me think itover.\"\\n Then he kissed her lips; and so they  parted.\"\\n On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina were asgood as engaged  to each other; and the boatman found out that he hadalways expected it would be so,  and went home with Ib that evening,and remained the night in the farmhouse; but nothing  further wassaid of the engagement.\"\\nDuring the next year, two letters passedbetween  Ib and Christina.\"\\nThey were signed, \"Faithful till death;\" butat the end of that time,  one day the boatman came over to see Ib, witha kind greeting from Christina.\"\\nHe had  something else to say, whichmade him hesitate in a strange manner.\"\\nAt last it came  out thatChristina, who had grown a very pretty girl, was more lucky than ever.She  was courted and admired by every one; but her master\\'s son, whohad been home on a  visit, was so much pleased with Christina that hewished to marry her.\"\\nHe had a very  good situation in an office atCopenhagen, and as she had also taken a liking for him,  his parentswere not unwilling to consent.\"\\nBut Christina, in her heart, oftenthought  of Ib, and knew how much he thought of her; so she feltinclined to refuse this good  fortune, added the boatman.\"\\nAt first Ibsaid not a word, but he became as white as  the wall, and shook hishead gently, and then he spoke,- \"Christina must not refuse  thisgood fortune.\"\\n  \"Then will you write a few words to her?\"\\n said the boatman.\"\\n Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all.\"\\nThe wordswere not what he wished  to say, so he tore up the page.\"\\nThefollowing morning, however, a letter lay ready  to be sent toChristina, and the following is what he wrote:-  \"The letter written by you to your father I have read, and seefrom it that you are  prosperous in everything, and that still betterfortune is in store for you.\"\\nAsk your  own heart, Christina, andthink over carefully what awaits you if you take me for  yourhusband, for I possess very little in the world.\"\\nDo not think of me orof my position;  think only of your own welfare.\"\\nYou are bound to me byno promises; and if in your  heart you have given me one, I release youfrom it.\"\\nMay every blessing and happiness  be poured out upon you,Christina.\"\\nHeaven will give me the heart\\'s consolation.\"\\n Ever your sincere friend, IB.\"\\n  This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due time.\"\\nInthe course of the  following November, her banns were published inthe church on the heath, and also in  Copenhagen, where thebridegroom lived.\"\\nShe was taken to Copenhagen under the  protectionof her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not sparetime  from his numerous occupations for a journey so far intoJutland.\"\\nOn the journey,  Christina met her father at one of thevillages through which they passed, and here  he took leave of her.Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer  toit; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent andpensive.\"\\nThinking  as he did of old times, no wonder the three nutscame into his mind which the gypsy  woman had given him when a child,and of the two which he had given to Christina.\"\\nThese  wishing nuts,after all, had proved true fortune-tellers.\"\\nOne had contained a  gildedcarriage and noble horses, and the other beautiful clothes; all ofthese  Christina would now have in her new home at Copenhagen.\"\\nHer parthad come true.\"\\nAnd  for him the nut had contained only black earth.\"\\nThegypsy woman had said it was the  best for him.\"\\nPerhaps it was, and thisalso would be fulfilled.\"\\nHe understood the gypsy  woman\\'s meaningnow.\"\\nThe black earth- the dark grave- was the best thing for him now.\"\\n Again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long years toIb.\"\\nThe old innkeeper  and his wife died one after the other; and thewhole of their property, many thousand  dollars, was inherited by theirson.\"\\nChristina could have the golden carriage now,  and plenty offine clothes.\"\\nDuring the two long years which followed, no letter  camefrom Christina to her father; and when at last her father received onefrom her,  it did not speak of prosperity or happiness.\"\\nPoor Christina!Neither she nor her  husband understood how to economize or save, andthe riches brought no blessing with  them, because they had not askedfor it.\"\\n Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered withbloom; in winter the  snow rested upon it, and the rough winds blewacross the ridge under which stood Ib\\'s  sheltered home.\"\\nOne spring daythe sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough  across hisfield.\"\\nThe ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was  afirestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter ofshining metal which  the plough had cut from something which gleamedbrightly in the furrow.\"\\nHe searched,  and found a large golden armletof superior workmanship, and it was evident that the  plough haddisturbed a Hun\\'s grave.\"\\nHe searched further, and found morevaluable  treasures, which Ib showed to the clergyman, who explainedtheir value to him.\"\\nThen  he went to the magistrate, who informed thepresident of the museum of the discovery,  and advised Ib to take thetreasures himself to the president.\"\\n \"You have found in the earth the best thing you could find,\"said the magistrate.\"\\n \"The best thing,\" thought Ib; \"the very best thing for me,- andfound in the earth!\"\\n Well, if it really is so, then the gypsy woman wasright in her prophecy.\"\\n  So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.\"\\nTo him whohad only sailed  once or twice on the river near his own home, thisseemed like a voyage on the ocean;  and at length he arrived atCopenhagen.\"\\nThe value of the gold he had found was paid  to him; it wasa large sum- six hundred dollars.\"\\nThen Ib of the heath went out,  andwandered about in the great city.\"\\n On the evening before the day he had settled to return with thecaptain of the  passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the streets, andtook quite a different turning to  the one he wished to follow.\"\\nHewandered on till he found himself in a poor street  of the suburbcalled Christian\\'s Haven.\"\\nNot a creature could be seen.\"\\nAt last a  verylittle girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ibasked her to  tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked uptimidly at him, and began to  cry bitterly.\"\\nHe asked her what was thematter; but what she said he could not  understand.\"\\nSo he went alongthe street with her; and as they passed under a lamp,  the light fellon the little girl\\'s face.\"\\nA strange sensation came over Ib, as hecaught  sight of it.\"\\nThe living, breathing embodiment of LittleChristina stood before him,  just as he remembered her in the days ofher childhood.\"\\nHe followed the child to the  wretched house, andascended the narrow, crazy staircase which led to a little garret  inthe roof.\"\\nThe air in the room was heavy and stifling, no light wasburning, and from  one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing.\"\\nItwas the mother of the child who lay  there on a miserable bed.\"\\nWith thehelp of a match, Ib struck a light, and approached  her.\"\\n \"Can I be of any service to you?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n\"This little girlbrought me up here;

till at length winter set in, and thesun  entirely disappeared; for many weeks there would be constantnight.\"\\nAll around, as  far as the eye could reach, nothing could beseen but fields of ice, in which the ship  remained stuck fast.\"\\nThesnow lay piled up in great heaps, and of these the sailors  madehuts, in the form of bee-hives, some of them as large and spaciousas one of the  \"Huns\\' graves,\" and others only containing room enoughto hold three or four men.\"\\nIt  was not quite dark; the northernlights shot forth red and blue flames, like continuous  fireworks,and the snow glittered, and reflected back the light, so that thenight here  was one long twilight.\"\\nWhen the moon was brightest, thenatives came in crowds to see  the sailors.\"\\nThey had a very singularappearance in their rough, hairy dresses of fur,  and riding in sledgesover the ice.\"\\nThey brought with them furs and skins in  greatabundance, so that the snow-houses were soon provided with warmcarpets, and the  furs also served for the sailors to wrap themselvesin, when they slept under the roofs  of snow, while outside it wasfreezing with a cold far more severe than in the winter  with us.\"\\nInour country it was still autumn, though late in the season; and theythought  of that in their distant exile, and often pictured tothemselves the yellow leaves  on the trees at home.\"\\nTheir watchespointed to the hours of evening, and time to go  to sleep, althoughin these regions it was now always night.\"\\n In one of the huts, two of the men laid themselves down to rest.The younger of these  men had brought with him from home his best,his dearest treasure- a Bible, which his  grandmother had given himon his departure.\"\\nEvery night the sacred volume rested under  his head,and he had known from his childhood what was written in it.\"\\nEveryday he read  in the book, and while stretched on his cold couch, theholy words he had learnt would  come into his mind: \"If I take thewings of the morning, and fly to the uttermost parts  of the sea,even there Thou art with me, and Thy right hand shall uphold me;\"and under  the influence of that faith which these holy words inspired,sleep came upon him, and  dreams, which are the manifestations of Godto the spirit.\"\\nThe soul lives and acts,  while the body is at rest.He felt this life in him, and it was as if he heard the  sound of dear,well-known melodies, as if the breezes of summer floated around him;and  over his couch shone a ray of brightness, as if it were shiningthrough the covering  of his snow-roof.\"\\nHe lifted his head, and sawthat the bright gleaming was not the  reflection of the glitteringsnow, but the dazzling brightness of the pinions of a  mighty angel,into whose beaming face he was gazing.\"\\nAs from the cup of a lily,the  angel rose from amidst the leaves of the Bible; and, stretchingout his arm, the walls  of the hut sunk down, as though they had beenformed of a light, airy veil of mist,  and the green hills andmeadows of home, with its ruddy woods, lay spread around him  in thequiet sunshine of a lovely autumn day.\"\\nThe nest of the stork wasempty, but ripe  fruit still hung on the wild apple-tree, althoughthe leaves had fallen.\"\\nThe red hips  gleamed on the hedges, and thestarling which hung in the green cage outside the window  of thepeasant\\'s hut, which was his home, whistled the tune which he hadtaught him.\"\\n His grandmother hung green birds\\'-food around the cage, ashe, her grandson, had been  accustomed to do.\"\\nThe daughter of thevillage blacksmith, who was young and fair, stood  at the well, drawingwater.\"\\nShe nodded to the grandmother, and the old woman nodded  to her,and pointed to a letter which had come from a long way off.\"\\nThatvery morning  the letter had arrived from the cold regions of thenorth; there, where the absent  one was sweetly sleeping under theprotecting hand of God.\"\\nThey laughed and wept over  the letter; and he,far away, amid ice and snow, under the shadow of the angel\\'s  wings,wept and smiled with them in spirit; for he saw and heard it all inhis dream.\"\\n From the letter they read aloud the words of Holy Writ: \"Inthe uttermost parts of  the sea, Thy right hand shall uphold me.\"\\n Andas the angel spread his wings like a  veil over the sleeper, therewas the sound of beautiful music and a hymn.\"\\nThen the  vision fled.It was dark again in the snow-hut: but the Bible still restedbeneath his  head, and faith and hope dwelt in his heart.\"\\nGod waswith him, and he carried home  in his heart, even \"in the uttermostparts of the sea.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  JACK THE DULLARD  AN OLD STORY TOLD ANEW  by Hans Christian Andersen  FAR in the interior of the country lay an old baronial hall, andin it lived an old  proprietor, who had two sons, which two young menthought themselves too clever by  half.\"\\nThey wanted to go out and woothe King\\'s daughter;

\"forif you do, I shall  hit your horse on the head, so that he will dropdead on the spot, and there will be  an end of him.\"\\n  \"I promise you I will not say it any more,\" said the other; but assoon as people came  by, nodding to him, and wishing him \"Good day,\" hebecame so pleased, and thought how  grand it looked to have five horsesploughing in his field, that he cried out again,  \"Gee-up, all myhorses!\"\\n  \"I\\'ll gee-up your horses for you,\" said Big Claus; and seizing ahammer, he struck  the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and hefell dead instantly.\"\\n \"Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping.\"\\nButafter a while he took  off the dead horse\\'s skin, and hung the hideto dry in the wind.\"\\nThen he put the dry  skin into a bag, and,placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town to  sellthe horse\\'s skin.\"\\nHe had a very long way to go, and had to passthrough a dark,  gloomy forest.\"\\nPresently a storm arose, and he losthis way, and before he discovered  the right path, evening came on, andit was still a long way to the town, and too far  to return home beforenight.\"\\nNear the road stood a large farmhouse.\"\\nThe shutters  outside thewindows were closed, but lights shone through the crevices at the top.\"\\nI  might get permission to stay here for the night,\" thought LittleClaus; so he went  up to the door and knocked.\"\\nThe farmer\\'s wife openedthe door; but when she heard what  he wanted, she told him to goaway, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers.\"\\n \"Then Ishall be obliged to lie out here,\" said Little Claus to himself, asthe farmer\\'s  wife shut the door in his face.\"\\nNear to the farmhousestood a large haystack, and  between it and the house was a small shed,with a thatched roof.\"\\n\"I can lie up there,\"  said Little Claus, as hesaw the roof; \"it will make a famous bed, but I hope the stork  willnot fly down and bite my legs;\" for on it stood a living stork,whose nest was  in the roof.\"\\nSo Little Claus climbed to the roof of theshed, and while he turned himself  to get comfortable, he discoveredthat the wooden shutters, which were closed, did  not reach to the topsof the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a  room,in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and asplendid fish.\"\\n The farmer\\'s wife and the sexton were sitting at thetable together; and she filled  his glass, and helped him plenteouslyto fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish.\"\\n \"If I could onlyget some, too,\" thought Little Claus; and then, as he stretched hisneck  towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,- indeedthey had a glorious feast  before them.\"\\n At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards thefarmhouse.\"\\nIt was  the farmer returning home.\"\\nHe was a good man, butstill he had a very strange  prejudice,- he could not bear the sight ofa sexton.\"\\nIf one appeared before him, he  would put himself in aterrible rage.\"\\nIn consequence of this dislike, the sexton had  goneto visit the farmer\\'s wife during her husband\\'s absence from home, andthe good  woman had placed before him the best she had in the houseto eat.\"\\nWhen she heard the  farmer coming she was frightened, andbegged the sexton to hide himself in a large  empty chest that stood inthe room.\"\\nHe did so, for he knew her husband could not endure  thesight of a sexton.\"\\nThe woman then quickly put away the wine, and hidall the rest  of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband hadseen them he would have asked  what they were brought out for.\"\\n \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as hesaw all the good things  disappear.\"\\n \"Is any one up there?\"\\n asked the farmer, looking up anddiscovering Little Claus.\"\\n\"Why  are you lying up there?\"\\nCome down,and come into the house with me.\"\\n So Little Claus  came down and toldthe farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night\\'s lodging.\"\\n \"All right,\" said the farmer; \"but we must have something to eatfirst.\"\\n  The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth on alarge table, and placed  before them a dish of porridge.\"\\nThe farmer wasvery hungry, and ate his porridge with  a good appetite, but LittleClaus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat, fish  and pies,which he knew were in the oven.\"\\nUnder the table, at his feet, laythe sack  containing the horse\\'s skin, which he intended to sell at thenext town.\"\\nNow Little  Claus did not relish the porridge at all, sohe trod with his foot on the sack under  the table, and the dry skinsqueaked quite loud.\"\\n\"Hush!\"\\n said Little Claus to his sack,  at thesame time treading upon it again, till it squeaked louder than before.\"\\n \"Hallo!\"\\nwhat have you got in your sack!\"\\n asked the farmer.\"\\n \"Oh, it is a conjuror,\" said Little Claus; \"and he says we neednot eat porridge, for  he has conjured the oven full of roast meat,fish, and pie.\"\\n  \"Wonderful!\"\\n cried the farmer, starting up and opening the ovendoor; and there lay  all the nice things hidden by the farmer\\'s wife,but which he supposed had been conjured  there by the wizard underthe table.\"\\nThe woman dared not say anything; so she placed  thethings before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and thepastry.\"\\n Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it squeaked asbefore.\"\\n\"What does he  say now?\"\\n asked the farmer.\"\\n \"He says,\" replied Little Claus, \"that there are three bottlesof wine for us, standing  in the corner, by the oven.\"\\n  So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she hadhidden, and the  farmer drank it till he became quite merry.\"\\nHe wouldhave liked such a conjuror as  Little Claus carried in his sack.\"\\n\"Couldhe conjure up the evil one?\"\\n asked the farmer.\"\\n \"I should like to seehim now, while I am so merry.\"\\n  \"Oh, yes!\"\\n replied Little Claus, \"my conjuror can do anything Iask him,- can you not?\"\\n  he asked, treading at the same time on thesack till it squeaked.\"\\n\"Do you hear?\"\\nhe  answers \\'Yes,\\' but he fearsthat we shall not like to look at him.\"\\n  \"Oh, I am not afraid.\"\\nWhat will he be like?\"\\n  \"Well, he is very much like a sexton.\"\\n  \"Ha!\"\\n said the farmer, \"then he must be ugly.\"\\nDo you know I cannotendure the sight  of a sexton.\"\\nHowever, that doesn\\'t matter, I shallknow who it is; so I shall not mind.\"\\n Now then, I have got up mycourage, but don\\'t let him come too near me.\"\\n  \"Stop, I must ask the conjuror,\" said Little Claus; so he trodon the bag, and stooped  his ear down to listen.\"\\n \"What does he say?\"\\n  \"He says that you must go and open that large chest which standsin the corner, and  you will see the evil one crouching down inside;but you must hold the lid firmly,  that he may not slip out.\"\\n  \"Will you come and help me hold it?\"\\n said the farmer, goingtowards the chest in which  his wife had hidden the sexton, who now layinside, very much frightened.\"\\nThe farmer  opened the lid a verylittle way, and peeped in.\"\\n \"Oh,\" cried he, springing backwards, \"I saw him, and he is exactlylike our sexton.\"\\n How dreadful it is!\"\\n So after that he was obligedto drink again, and they sat and  drank till far into the night.\"\\n \"You must sell your conjuror to me,\" said the farmer; \"ask as muchas you like, I will  pay it; indeed I would give you directly a wholebushel of gold.\"\\n  \"No, indeed, I cannot,\" said Little Claus; \"only think how muchprofit I could make  out of this conjuror.\"\\n  \"But I should like to have him,\" said the fanner, still continuinghis entreaties.\"\\n \"Well,\" said Little Claus at length, \"you have been so good asto give me a night\\'s  lodging, I will not refuse you; you shall havethe conjuror for a bushel of money,  but I will have quite fullmeasure.\"\\n  \"So you shall,\" said the farmer; \"but you must take away the chestas well.\"\\nI would  not have it in the house another hour; there is noknowing if he may not be still there.\"\\n  So Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the driedhorse\\'s skin, and  received in exchange a bushel of money- fullmeasure.\"\\nThe farmer also gave him a  wheelbarrow on which to carry awaythe chest and the gold.\"\\n \"Farewell,\" said Little Claus, as he went off with his money andthe great chest, in  which the sexton lay still concealed.\"\\nOn oneside of the forest was a broad, deep river,  the water flowed sorapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream.\"\\nA  newbridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of thisbridge Little  Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard bythe sexton, \"Now what shall I do  with this stupid chest; it is asheavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired  if I roll itany farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims afterme  to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much matter.\"\\n  So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, asif he were going to  throw it into the water.\"\\n \"No, leave it alone,\" cried the sexton from within the chest; \"letme out first.\"\\n  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened, \"heis in there still, is  he?\"\\nI must throw him into the river, that he maybe drowned.\"\\n  \"Oh, no; oh, no,\" cried the sexton; \"I will give you a wholebushel full of money if  you will let me go.\"\\n \"Why, that is another matter,\" said Little Claus, opening thechest.\"\\nThe sexton crept  out, pushed the empty chest into the water,and went to his house, then he measured  out a whole bushel full ofgold for Little Claus, who had already received one from  the farmer,so that now he had a barrow full.\"\\n \"I have been well paid for my horse,\" said he to himself when hereached home, entered  his own room, and emptied all his money into aheap on the floor.\"\\n\"How vexed Great  Claus will be when he finds outhow rich I have become all through my one horse; but  I shall nottell him exactly how it all happened.\"\\n Then he sent a boy to GreatClaus  to borrow a bushel measure.\"\\n \"What can he want it for?\"\\n thought Great Claus; so he smearedthe bottom of the measure  with tar, that some of whatever was put intoit might stick there and remain.\"\\nAnd so  it happened; for when themeasure returned, three new silver florins were sticking  to it.\"\\n \"What does this mean?\"\\n said Great Claus; so he ran off directly toLittle Claus, and  asked, \"Where did you get so much money?\"\\n  \"Oh, for my horse\\'s skin, I sold it yesterday.\"\\n  \"It was certainly well paid for then,\" said Great Claus; and heran home to his house,  seized a hatchet, and knocked all his fourhorses on the head, flayed off their skins,  and took them to thetown to sell.\"\\n\"Skins, skins, who\\'ll buy skins?\"\\n he cried, as he  wentthrough the streets.\"\\nAll the shoemakers and tanners came running,and asked how  much he wanted for them.\"\\n \"A bushel of money, for each,\" replied Great Claus.\"\\n \"Are you mad?\"\\n they all cried; \"do you think we have money tospend by the bushel?\"\\n  \"Skins, skins,\" he cried again, \"who\\'ll buy skins?\"\\n but to all whoinquired the price,  his answer was, \"a bushel of money.\"\\n  \"He is making fools of us,\" said they all; then the shoemakerstook their straps, and  the tanners their leather aprons, and beganto beat Great Claus.\"\\n \"Skins, skins!\"\\n they cried, mocking him; \"yes, we\\'ll mark yourskin for you, till it  is black and blue.\"\\n  \"Out of the town with him,\" said they.\"\\nAnd Great Claus was obligedto run as fast as  he could, he had never before been so thoroughlybeaten.\"\\n \"Ah,\" said he, as he came to his house; \"Little Claus shall pay mefor this; I will  beat him to death.\"\\n  Meanwhile the old grandmother of Little Claus died.\"\\nShe had beencross, unkind, and  really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry,and took the dead woman and laid her  in his warm bed to see if hecould bring her to life again.\"\\nThere he determined that  she should liethe whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of theroom  as he had often done before.\"\\nDuring the night, as he sat there,the door opened, and  in came Great Claus with a hatchet.\"\\nHe knewwell where Little Claus\\'s bed stood; so  he went right up to it, andstruck the old grandmother on the head.\"\\nthinking it must  be LittleClaus.\"\\n \"There,\" cried he, \"now you cannot make a fool of me again;\" andthen he went home.\"\\n \"That is a very wicked man,\" thought Little Claus; \"he meant tokill me.\"\\nIt is a good  thing for my old grandmother that she wasalready dead, or he would have taken her  life.\"\\n Then he dressed hisold grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse of  his neighbor,and harnessed it to a cart.\"\\nThen he placed the old woman on the backseat,  so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode awaythrough the wood.\"\\nBy sunrise  they reached a large inn, where LittleClaus stopped and went to get something to eat.\"\\n The landlord was arich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been  madeof pepper and snuff.\"\\n \"Good morning,\" said he to Little Claus; \"you are come betimesto-day.\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said Little Claus; \"I am going to the town with my oldgrandmother; she is  sitting at the back of the wagon, but I cannotbring her into the room.\"\\nWill you take  her a glass of mead?\"\\nbut youmust speak very loud, for she cannot hear well.\"\\n  \"Yes, certainly I will,\" replied the landlord; and, pouring outa glass of mead, he  carried it out to the dead grandmother, who satupright in the cart.\"\\n\"Here is a glass  of mead from your grandson,\"said the landlord.\"\\nThe dead woman did not answer a word,  but sat quitestill.\"\\n\"Do you not hear?\"\\n cried the landlord as loud as he could;\"here  is a glass of mead from your grandson.\"\\n  Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir heflew into a passion, and  threw the glass of mead in her face; itstruck her on the nose, and she fell backwards  out of the cart, forshe was only seated there, not tied in.\"\\n Hallo!\"\\n cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and seizinghold of the landlord  by the throat; \"you have killed my grandmother;see, here is a great hole in her  forehead.\"\\n  \"Oh, how unfortunate,\" said the landlord, wringing his hands.\"\\nThis all comes of my  fiery temper.\"\\nDear Little Claus, I will give youa bushel of money; I will bury your  grandmother as if she were my own;only keep silent, or else they will cut off my head,  and that would bedisagreeable.\"\\n  So it happened that Little Claus received another bushel of money,and the landlord  buried his old grandmother as if she had been hisown.\"\\nWhen Little Claus reached home  again, he immediately sent a boyto Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel  measure.\"\\n\"How isthis?\"\\n thought Great Claus; \"did I not kill him?\"\\nI must go and see  formyself.\"\\n So he went to Little Claus, and took the bushel measurewith him.\"\\n\"How  did you get all this money?\"\\n asked Great Claus, staringwith wide open eyes at his  neighbor\\'s treasures.\"\\n \"You killed my grandmother instead of me,\" said Little Claus;\"so I have sold her for  a bushel of money.\"\\n  \"That is a good price at all events,\" said Great Claus.\"\\nSo he wenthome, took a hatchet,  and killed his old grandmother with one blow.Then he placed her on a cart, and drove  into the town to theapothecary, and asked him if he would buy a dead body.\"\\n \"Whose is it, and where did you get it?\"\\n asked the apothecary.\"\\n \"It is my grandmother,\" he replied; \"I killed her with a blow,that I might get a bushel  of money for her.\"\\n  \"Heaven preserve us!\"\\n cried the apothecary, \"you are out of yourmind.\"\\nDon\\'t say such  things, or you will lose your head.\"\\n And thenhe talked to him seriously about the  wicked deed he had done, and toldhim that such a wicked man would surely be punished.\"\\n Great Claus gotso frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the  cart,whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.\"\\nThe apothecary andall the people  thought him mad, and let him drive where he liked.\"\\n \"You shall pay for this,\" said Great Claus, as soon as he got intothe highroad, \"that  you shall, Little Claus.\"\\n So as soon as he reachedhome he took the largest sack he  could find and went over to LittleClaus.\"\\n\"You have played me another trick,\" said  he.\"\\n\"First, I killedall my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all yourfault;  but you shall not make a fool of me any more.\"\\n So he laidhold of Little Claus round  the body, and pushed him into the sack,which he took on his shoulders, saying, \"Now  I\\'m going to drown you inthe river.\"\\n He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and LittleClaus was not a very  light weight to carry.\"\\nThe road led by thechurch, and as they passed he could hear  the organ playing and thepeople singing beautifully.\"\\nGreat Claus put down the sack  close to thechurch-door, and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalmbefore  he went any farther.\"\\nLittle Claus could not possibly get out ofthe sack, and all the  people were in church; so in he went.\"\\n \"Oh dear, oh dear,\" sighed Little Claus in the sack, as heturned and twisted about;  but he found he could not loosen thestring with which it was tied.\"\\nPresently an old  cattle driver, withsnowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand,  withwhich he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him.\"\\nThey stumbledagainst  the sack in which lay Little Claus, and turned it over.\"\\n\"Ohdear,\" sighed Little Claus,  \"I am very young, yet I am soon going toheaven.\"\\n  \"And I, poor fellow,\" said the drover, \"I who am so old already,cannot get there.\"\\n  \"Open the sack,\" cried Little Claus; \"creep into it instead of me,and you will soon  be there.\"\\n  \"With all my heart,\" replied the drover, opening the sack, fromwhich sprung Little  Claus as quickly as possible.\"\\n\"Will you takecare of my cattle?\"\\n said the old man,  as he crept into the bag.\"\\n \"Yes,\" said Little Claus, and he tied up the sack, and then walkedoff with all the  cows and oxen.\"\\n When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack, andplaced it on his shoulders.\"\\n It appeared to have become lighter, forthe old drover was not half so heavy as Little  Claus.\"\\n \"How light he seems now,\" said he.\"\\n\"Ah, it is because I havebeen to a church.\"\\n So  he walked on to the river, which was deep andbroad, and threw the sack containing  the old drover into the water,believing it to be Little Claus.\"\\n\"There you may lie!\"\\n  he exclaimed;\"you will play me no more tricks now.\"\\n Then he turned to go home,but  when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there wasLittle Claus driving the  cattle.\"\\n\"How is this?\"\\n said Great Claus.\"\\n\"DidI not drown you just now?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said Little Claus; \"you threw me into the river abouthalf an hour ago.\"\\n  \"But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?\"\\n asked GreatClaus.\"\\n \"These beasts are sea-cattle,\" replied Little Claus.\"\\n\"I\\'ll tellyou the whole story,  and thank you for drowning me; I am above younow, I am really very rich.\"\\nI was  frightened, to be sure, while Ilay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my  ears when youthrew me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the  bottomimmediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifullysoft grass  which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened,and the sweetest little maiden  came towards me.\"\\nShe had snow-whiterobes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet  hair.\"\\nShe took me bythe hand, and said, \\'So you are come, Little Claus, and here aresome  cattle for you to begin with.\"\\nAbout a mile farther on the road,there is another herd  for you.\\' Then I saw that the river formed agreat highway for the people who live  in the sea.\"\\nThey were walkingand driving here and there from the sea to the land at  the, spot wherethe river terminates.\"\\nThe bed of the river was covered with  theloveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass.\"\\nThe fish swam past me asrapidly as the  birds do here in the air.\"\\nHow handsome all the peoplewere, and what fine cattle were  grazing on the hills and in thevalleys!\"\\n  \"But why did you come up again,\" said Great Claus, \"if it wasall so beautiful down  there?\"\\nI should not have done so?\"\\n  \"Well,\" said Little Claus, \"it was good policy on my part; youheard me say just now  that I was told by the sea-maiden to go a milefarther on the road, and I should find  a whole herd of cattle.\"\\nBythe road she meant the river, for she could not travel any  otherway; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends,sometimes to the right  and sometimes to the left, and it seemed a longway, so I chose a shorter one; and,  by coming up to the land, and thendriving across the fields back again to the river,  I shall save half amile, and get all my cattle more quickly.\"\\n  \"What a lucky fellow you are!\"\\n exclaimed Great Claus.\"\\n\"Do youthink I should get any  sea-cattle if I went down to the bottom ofthe river?\"\\n  \"Yes, I think so,\" said Little Claus; \"but I cannot carry youthere in a sack, you  are too heavy.\"\\nHowever if you will go therefirst, and then creep into a sack, I will  throw you in with thegreatest pleasure.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said Great Claus; \"but remember, if I do not getany sea-cattle down there  I shall come up again and give you a goodthrashing.\"\\n  \"No, now, don\\'t be too fierce about it!\"\\n said Little Claus, asthey walked on towards  the river.\"\\nWhen they approached it, the cattle,who were very thirsty, saw the stream,  and ran down to drink.\"\\n \"See what a hurry they are in,\" said Little Claus, \"they arelonging to get down again,\"  \"Come, help me, make haste,\" said Great Claus; \"or you\\'ll getbeaten.\"\\n So he crept  into a large sack, which had been lying acrossthe back of one of the oxen.\"\\n \"Put in a stone,\" said Great Claus, \"or I may not sink.\"\\n  \"Oh, there\\'s not much fear of that,\" he replied; still he put alarge stone into the  bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave it apush.\"\\n \"Plump!\"\\n In went Great Claus, and immediately sank to the bottomof the river.\"\\n \"I\\'m afraid he will not find any cattle,\" said Little Claus, andthen he drove his  own beasts homewards.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  LITTLE IDA\\'S FLOWERS  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"My poor flowers are quite dead,\" said little Ida, \"they were sopretty yesterday  evening, and now all the leaves are hanging downquite withered.\"\\nWhat do they do that  for,\" she asked, of the studentwho sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could  tell the mostamusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, andladies  dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; hewas a delightful  student.\"\\n\"Why do the flowers look so faded to-day?\"\\nshe asked again, and pointed to  her nosegay, which was quite withered.\"\\n \"Don\\'t you know what is the matter with them?\"\\n said the student.\"\\nThe flowers were  at a ball last night, and therefore, it is no wonderthey hang their heads.\"\\n  \"But flowers cannot dance?\"\\n cried little Ida.\"\\n \"Yes indeed, they can,\" replied the student.\"\\n\"When it growsdark, and everybody is  asleep, they jump about quite merrily.\"\\nTheyhave a ball almost every night.\"\\n  \"Can children go to these balls?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said the student, \"little daisies and lilies of thevalley.\"\\n  \"Where do the beautiful flowers dance?\"\\n asked little Ida.\"\\n \"Have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates of thetown, where the  king lives in summer, and where the beautiful gardenis full of flowers?\"\\nAnd have you  not fed the swans with bread whenthey swam towards you?\"\\nWell, the flowers have capital  balls there,believe me.\"\\n  \"I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother,\" saidIda, \"but all the leaves  were off the trees, and there was not asingle flower left.\"\\nWhere are they?\"\\nI used  to see so many in thesummer.\"\\n  \"They are in the castle,\" replied the student.\"\\n\"You must know thatas soon as the king  and all the court are gone into the town, theflowers run out of the garden into the  castle, and you should seehow merry they are.\"\\nThe two most beautiful roses seat  themselves onthe throne, and are called the king and queen, then all the redcockscombs  range themselves on each side, and bow, these are thelords-in-waiting.\"\\nAfter that  the pretty flowers come in, and thereis a grand ball.\"\\nThe blue violets represent little  naval cadets, anddance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies.\"\\n Thetulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch thedancing, so that  everything may be conducted with order andpropriety.\"\\n  \"But,\" said little Ida, \"is there no one there to hurt the flowersfor dancing in the  king\\'s castle?\"\\n  \"No one knows anything about it,\" said the student.\"\\n\"The oldsteward of the castle,  who has to watch there at night, sometimescomes in; but he carries a great bunch of  keys, and as soon as theflowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide themselves  behindthe long curtains, and stand quite still, just peeping their headsout.\"\\nThen  the old steward says, \\'I smell flowers here,\\' but hecannot see them.\"\\n  \"Oh how capital,\" said little Ida, clapping her hands.\"\\n\"Should Ibe able to see these  flowers?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said the student, \"mind you think of it the next time yougo out, no doubt you  will see them, if you peep through the window.I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow  lily lying stretched out onthe sofa.\"\\nShe was a court lady.\"\\n  \"Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these balls?\"\\nasked Ida.\"\\n\"It is such  a distance!\"\\n  \"Oh yes,\" said the student \\'whenever they like, for they canfly.\"\\nHave you not seen  those beautiful red, white.\"\\nand yellowbutterflies, that look like flowers?\"\\nThey were  flowers once.\"\\nThey haveflown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves  as ifthey were little wings to make them fly.\"\\nThen, if they behave well,they obtain  permission to fly about during the day, instead of beingobliged to sit still on their  stems at home, and so in time theirleaves become real wings.\"\\nIt may be, however, that  the flowers inthe Botanical Gardens have never been to the king\\'s palace,  and,therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at night, whichtake place there.\"\\n I will tell you what to do, and the botanicalprofessor, who lives close by here, will  be so surprised.\"\\nYou know himvery well, do you not?\"\\nWell, next time you go into his  garden, youmust tell one of the flowers that there is going to be a grand ball atthe  castle, then that flower will tell all the others, and they willfly away to the castle  as soon as possible.\"\\nAnd when the professorwalks into his garden, there will not be  a single flower left.\"\\nHowhe will wonder what has become of them!\"\\n  \"But how can one flower tell another?\"\\nFlowers cannot speak?\"\\n  \"No, certainly not,\" replied the student; \"but they can makesigns.\"\\nHave you not often  seen that when the wind blows they nod atone another, and rustle all their green  leaves?\"\\n  \"Can the professor understand the signs?\"\\n asked Ida.\"\\n \"Yes, to be sure he can.\"\\nHe went one morning into his garden,and saw a stinging nettle  making signs with its leaves to abeautiful red carnation.\"\\nIt was saying, \\'You are  so pretty, I like youvery much.\\' But the professor did not approve of such nonsense,  sohe clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it.\"\\nThen the leaves,which are its fingers,  stung him so sharply that he has never venturedto touch a nettle since.\"\\n  \"Oh how funny!\"\\n said Ida, and she laughed.\"\\n \"How can anyone put such notions into a child\\'s head?\"\\n said atiresome lawyer, who  had come to pay a visit, and sat on the sofa.He did not like the student, and would  grumble when he saw him cuttingout droll or amusing pictures.\"\\nSometimes it would be  a man hangingon a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been  stealinghearts.\"\\nSometimes it was an old witch riding through the air on abroom and  carrying her husband on her nose.\"\\nBut the lawyer did notlike such jokes, and he would  say as he had just said, \"How can anyoneput such nonsense into a child\\'s head!\"\\nwhat  absurd fancies there are!\"\\n  But to little Ida, all these stories which the student told herabout the flowers,  seemed very droll, and she thought over them agreat deal.\"\\nThe flowers did hang their  heads, because they had beendancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely  they were ill.Then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on apretty  little table, and the whole of the table drawer besides wasfull of beautiful things.\"\\n Her doll Sophy lay in the doll\\'s bed asleep,and little Ida said to her, \"You must  really get up Sophy, and becontent to lie in the drawer to-night; the poor flowers  are ill, andthey must lie in your bed, then perhaps they will get well again.\"\\nSo she  took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not asingle word, for she was  angry at being turned out of her bed.\"\\nIdaplaced the flowers in the doll\\'s bed, and  drew the quilt over them.Then she told them to lie quite still and be good, while  she made sometea for them, so that they might be quite well and able to get upthe  next morning.\"\\nAnd she drew the curtains close round the littlebed, so that the sun  might not shine in their eyes.\"\\nDuring the wholeevening she could not help thinking  of what the student had toldher.\"\\nAnd before she went to bed herself, she was obliged  to peepbehind the curtains into the garden where all her mother\\'s beautifulflowers  grew, hyacinths and tulips, and many others.\"\\nThen shewhispered to them quite softly,  \"I know you are going to a ballto-night.\"\\n But the flowers appeared as if they did  not understand, andnot a leaf moved; still Ida felt quite sure she knew all about  it.\"\\nShelay awake a long time after she was in bed, thinking how pretty itmust be to  see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king\\'s garden.\"\\nI wonder if my flowers  have really been there,\" she said toherself, and then she fell asleep.\"\\nIn the night  she awoke; she hadbeen dreaming of the flowers and of the student, as well as of  thetiresome lawyer who found fault with him.\"\\nIt was quite still inIda\\'s bedroom; the  night-lamp burnt on the table, and her father andmother were asleep.\"\\n\"I wonder if  my flowers are still lying in Sophy\\'sbed,\" she thought to herself; \"how much I should  like to know.\"\\n Sheraised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where  allher flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as shelistened, it seemed  as if some one in the room was playing thepiano, but softly and more prettily than  she had ever before heard it.\"\\nNow all the flowers are certainly dancing in there,\"  she thought, \"ohhow much I should like to see them,\" but she did not dare move forfear  of disturbing her father and mother.\"\\n\"If they would only comein here,\" she thought;  but they did not come, and the musiccontinued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty,  that she couldresist no longer.\"\\nShe crept out of her little bed, went softly tothe  door and looked into the room.\"\\nOh what a splendid sight therewas to be sure!\"\\nThere  was no night-lamp burning, but the room appearedquite light, for the moon shone  through the window upon the floor, andmade it almost like day.\"\\nAll the hyacinths and  tulips stood in twolong rows down the room, not a single flower remained in the  window,and the flower-pots were all empty.\"\\nThe flowers were dancinggracefully on the  floor, making turns and holding each other bytheir long green leaves as they swung  round.\"\\nAt the piano sat alarge yellow lily which little Ida was sure she had seen  in thesummer, for she remembered the student saying she was very much likeMiss Lina,  one of Ida\\'s friends.\"\\nThey all laughed at him then, but nowit seemed to little Ida  as if the tall, yellow flower was reallylike the young lady.\"\\nShe had just the same  manners while playing,bending her long yellow face from side to side, and nodding  in time tothe beautiful music.\"\\nThen she saw a large purple crocus jump intothe middle  of the table where the playthings stood, go up to thedoll\\'s bedstead and draw back  the curtains; there lay the sickflowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the  others as asign that they wished to dance with them.\"\\nThe old rough doll, with thebroken  mouth, stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers.\"\\nThey did notlook ill at all now,  but jumped about and were very merry, yet none ofthem noticed little Ida.\"\\nPresently  it seemed as if something fell fromthe table.\"\\nIda looked that way, and saw a slight  carnival rodjumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them; it was,however,  very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broadbrimmed hat on her head, like  the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it.The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers  on its three redstilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka;  theflowers could not perform this dance, they were too light to stampin that manner.\"\\n All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnivalrod seemed to grow larger and taller,  and it turned round and saidto the paper flowers, \"How can you put such things in  a child\\'shead?\"\\nthey are all foolish fancies;\" and then the doll was exactlylike the  lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow andas cross as he did; but  the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs,and he shrunk up again and became quite  a little wax doll.\"\\nThis wasvery amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.\"\\nThe carnival  rod wenton dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also.\"\\nIt was no use,he might  make himself great and tall, or remain a little wax doll witha large black hat; still  he must dance.\"\\nThen at last the other flowersinterceded for him, especially those  who had lain in the doll\\'s bed,and the carnival rod gave up his dancing.\"\\nAt the same  moment a loudknocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida\\'s doll Sophy lay with  manyother toys.\"\\nThen the rough doll ran to the end of the table, laidhimself flat  down upon it, and began to pull the drawer out a littleway.\"\\n Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished,\"There must be a ball  here to-night,\" said Sophy.\"\\n\"Why did notsomebody tell me?\"\\n  \"Will you dance with me?\"\\n said the rough doll.\"\\n \"You are the right sort to dance with, certainly,\" said she,turning her back upon  him.\"\\n Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thoughtthat perhaps one of  the flowers would ask her to dance; but none ofthem came.\"\\nThen she coughed, \"Hem,  hem, a-hem;\" but for all that notone came.\"\\nThe shabby doll now danced quite alone,  and not verybadly, after all.\"\\nAs none of the flowers seemed to notice Sophy, shelet  herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to make a verygreat noise.\"\\nAll the  flowers came round her directly, and asked if shehad hurt herself, especially those  who had lain in her bed.\"\\nBut shewas not hurt at all, and Ida\\'s flowers thanked her  for the use ofthe nice bed, and were very kind to her.\"\\nThey led her into themiddle  of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, whileall the other flowers  formed a circle round them.\"\\nThen Sophy wasvery happy, and said they might keep her  bed; she did not mind lyingin the drawer at all.\"\\nBut the flowers thanked her very  much, andsaid,-  \"We cannot live long.\"\\nTo-morrow morning we shall be quite dead;and you must tell little  Ida to bury us in the garden, near to thegrave of the canary; then, in the summer  we shall wake up and bemore beautiful than ever.\"\\n  \"No, you must not die,\" said Sophy, as she kissed the flowers.\"\\n Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautifulflowers danced in.\"\\nIda  could not imagine where they could come from,unless they were the flowers from the  king\\'s garden.\"\\nFirst came twolovely roses, with little golden crowns on their heads;  these were theking and queen.\"\\nBeautiful stocks and carnations followed, bowing  toevery one present.\"\\nThey had also music with them.\"\\nLarge poppies andpeonies had  pea-shells for instruments, and blew into them till theywere quite red in the face.\"\\n The bunches of blue hyacinths and thelittle white snowdrops jingled their bell-like  flowers, as if theywere real bells.\"\\nThen came many more flowers: blue violets,  purpleheart\\'s-ease, daisies, and lilies of the valley, and they all dancedtogether,  and kissed each other.\"\\nIt was very beautiful to behold.\"\\n At last the flowers wished each other good-night.\"\\nThen littleIda crept back into her  bed again, and dreamt of all she had seen.When she arose the next morning, she went  quickly to the little table,to see if the flowers were still there.\"\\nShe drew aside  the curtains ofthe little bed.\"\\nThere they all lay, but quite faded; much more so  thanthe day before.\"\\nSophy was lying in the drawer where Ida had placedher; but she  looked very sleepy.\"\\n \"Do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me?\"\\n saidlittle Ida.\"\\nBut Sophy  looked quite stupid, and said not a single word.\"\\n \"You are not kind at all,\" said Ida; \"and yet they all danced withyou.\"\\n  Then she took a little paper box, on which were paintedbeautiful birds, and laid the  dead flowers in it.\"\\n \"This shall be your pretty coffin,\" she said; \"and by and by, whenmy cousins come  to visit me, they shall help me to bury you out in thegarden; so that next summer  you may grow up again more beautifulthan ever.\"\\n  Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were Jamesand Adolphus.\"\\nTheir  father had given them each a bow and arrow, andthey had brought them to show Ida.\"\\n She told them about the poorflowers which were dead; and as soon as they obtained  permission, theywent with her to bury them.\"\\nThe two boys walked first, with  theircrossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida followed, carrying thepretty box  containing the dead flowers.\"\\nThey dug a little grave in thegarden.\"\\nIda kissed her  flowers and then laid them, with the box, inthe earth.\"\\nJames and Adolphus then fired  their crossbows over thegrave, as they had neither guns nor cannons.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  LITTLE TINY OR THUMBELINA  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a littlechild, but she could not  obtain her wish.\"\\nAt last she went to a fairy,and said, \"I should so very much like  to have a little child; canyou tell me where I can find one?\"\\n  \"Oh, that can be easily managed,\" said the fairy.\"\\n\"Here is abarleycorn of a different  kind to those which grow in the farmer\\'sfields, and which the chickens eat; put it  into a flower-pot, andsee what will happen.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelveshillings, which was the  price of the barleycorn.\"\\nThen she went homeand planted it, and immediately there grew  up a large handsome flower,something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves  tightlyclosed as if it were still a bud.\"\\n\"It is a beautiful flower,\" said thewoman,  and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while shedid so the flower opened,  and she could see that it was a realtulip.\"\\nWithin the flower, upon the green velvet  stamens, sat a verydelicate and graceful little maiden.\"\\nShe was scarcely half as  longas a thumb, and they gave her the name of \"Thumbelina,\" or Tiny,because she was  so small.\"\\nA walnut-shell, elegantly polished, servedher for a cradle; her bed was  formed of blue violet-leaves, with arose-leaf for a counterpane.\"\\nHere she slept at  night, but during theday she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed  aplateful of water.\"\\nRound this plate were wreaths of flowers with theirstems in the  water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, whichserved Tiny for a boat.\"\\nHere the  little maiden sat and rowed herselffrom side to side, with two oars made of white  horse-hair.\"\\nIt reallywas a very pretty sight.\"\\nTiny could, also, sing so softly  andsweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.One night, while  she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toadcrept through a broken pane of glass  in the window, and leaped rightupon the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her  rose-leaf quilt.\"\\nWhat a pretty little wife this would make for my son, said thetoad,  and she took up the walnut-shell in which little Tiny layasleep, and jumped through  the window with it into the garden.\"\\n In the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived thetoad, with her son.\"\\n He was uglier even than his mother, and when hesaw the pretty little maiden in her  elegant bed, he could only cry,\"Croak, croak, croak.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t speak so loud, or she will wake,\" said the toad, \"andthen she might run away,  for she is as light as swan\\'s down.\"\\nWe willplace her on one of the water-lily leaves  out in the stream; it willbe like an island to her, she is so light and small, and  then shecannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste andprepare the  state-room under the marsh, in which you are to livewhen you are married.\"\\n  Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with broadgreen leaves, which  seemed to float on the top of the water.\"\\nThelargest of these leaves appeared farther  off than the rest, and theold toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which  little Tinylay still asleep.\"\\nThe tiny little creature woke very early in themorning,  and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, forshe could see nothing but  water on every side of the large green leaf,and no way of reaching the land.\"\\nMeanwhile  the old toad was verybusy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild  yellowflowers, to make it look pretty for her new daughter-in-law.\"\\nThenshe swam out  with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placedpoor little Tiny.\"\\nShe wanted  to fetch the pretty bed, that she mightput it in the bridal chamber to be ready for  her.\"\\nThe old toad bowedlow to her in the water, and said, \"Here is my son, he will  be yourhusband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream.\"\\n  \"Croak, croak, croak,\" was all her son could say for himself; sothe toad took up the  elegant little bed, and swam away with it,leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf,  where she sat and wept.She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and  havingher ugly son for a husband.\"\\nThe little fishes, who swam about in thewater beneath,  had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so theylifted their heads above the water  to look at the little maiden.\"\\nAssoon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was  very pretty, and itmade them very sorry to think that she must go and live with theugly  toads.\"\\n\"No, it must never be!\"\\n so they assembled together inthe water, round the green  stalk which held the leaf on which thelittle maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the  root with theirteeth.\"\\nThen the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far awayout  of reach of land.\"\\n Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushessaw her, and sang,  \"What a lovely little creature;\" so the leaf swamaway with her farther and farther,  till it brought her to other lands.A graceful little white butterfly constantly  fluttered round her,and at last alighted on the leaf.\"\\nTiny pleased him, and she was  gladof it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and thecountry through which  she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone uponthe water, till it glittered like  liquid gold.\"\\nShe took off her girdleand tied one end of it round the butterfly, and  the other end of theribbon she fastened to the leaf, which now glided on much  fasterthan ever, taking little Tiny with it as she stood.\"\\nPresently alarge cockchafer  flew by; the moment he caught sight of her, he seizedher round her delicate waist  with his claws, and flew with her intoa tree.\"\\nThe green leaf floated away on the brook,  and the butterflyflew with it, for he was fastened to it, and could not get away.\"\\n Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flewwith her to the tree!\"\\n But especially was she sorry for the beautifulwhite butterfly which she had fastened  to the leaf, for if he couldnot free himself he would die of hunger.\"\\nBut the cockchafer  did nottrouble himself at all about the matter.\"\\nHe seated himself by her sideon a  large green leaf, gave her some honey from the flowers to eat,and told her she was  very pretty, though not in the least like acockchafer.\"\\nAfter a time, all the  cockchafers turned up their feelers,and said, \"She has only two legs!\"\\nhow ugly that  looks.\"\\n \"She has nofeelers,\" said another.\"\\n\"Her waist is quite slim.\"\\nPooh!\"\\nshe is  likea human being.\"\\n  \"Oh!\"\\nshe is ugly,\" said all the lady cockchafers, although Tinywas very pretty.\"\\nThen  the cockchafer who had run away with her,believed all the others when they said she  was ugly, and would havenothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where  she liked.Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy,and  she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even thecockchafers would have  nothing to say to her.\"\\nAnd all the while shewas really the loveliest creature that  one could imagine, and astender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf.\"\\nDuring the  wholesummer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.\"\\nShe woveherself  a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a broad leaf,to protect herself from  the rain.\"\\nShe sucked the honey from theflowers for food, and drank the dew from their  leaves every morning.So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then came the  winter,-the long, cold winter.\"\\nAll the birds who had sung to her so sweetlywere flown  away, and the trees and the flowers had withered.\"\\nThe largeclover leaf under the  shelter of which she had lived, was now rolledtogether and shrivelled up, nothing  remained but a yellow witheredstalk.\"\\nShe felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were  torn, and shewas herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearlyfrozen  to death.\"\\nIt began to snow too; and the snow-flakes, as theyfell upon her, were like  a whole shovelful falling upon one of us, forwe are tall, but she was only an inch  high.\"\\nThen she wrapped herselfup in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could  not keepher warm, and she shivered with cold.\"\\nNear the wood in which she hadbeen living  lay a corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time;nothing remained but the bare  dry stubble standing up out of thefrozen ground.\"\\nIt was to her like struggling through  a large wood.\"\\nOh!how she shivered with the cold.\"\\nShe came at last to the door of  afield-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble.\"\\nTheredwelt the field-mouse  in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful ofcorn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining  room.\"\\nPoor little Tiny stoodbefore the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged  for a smallpiece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for twodays.\"\\n \"You poor little creature,\" said the field-mouse, who was really agood old field-mouse,  \"come into my warm room and dine with me.\"\\n Shewas very pleased with Tiny, so she said,  \"You are quite welcome tostay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep  my roomsclean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear themvery much.\"\\n  And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and foundherself very comfortable.\"\\n \"We shall have a visitor soon,\" said the field-mouse one day;\"my neighbor pays me  a visit once a week.\"\\nHe is better off than Iam; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful  black velvet coat.\"\\nIfyou could only have him for a husband, you would be well  providedfor indeed.\"\\nBut he is blind, so you must tell him some of yourprettiest  stories.\"\\n But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor, forhe was a mole.\"\\nHowever,  he came and paid his visit dressed in hisblack velvet coat.\"\\n \"He is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty times largerthan mine,\" said  the field-mouse.\"\\n He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke slightinglyof the sun and the  pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.Tiny was obliged to sing to him,  \"Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly awayhome,\" and many other pretty songs.\"\\nAnd the mole fell  in love with herbecause she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for hewas  very cautious.\"\\nA short time before, the mole had dug a longpassage under the earth,  which led from the dwelling of thefield-mouse to his own, and here she had permission  to walk withTiny whenever she liked.\"\\nBut he warned them not to be alarmed at thesight  of a dead bird which lay in the passage.\"\\nIt was a perfectbird, with a beak and feathers,  and could not have been dead long, andwas lying just where the mole had made his passage.\"\\n The mole took apiece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth, and it glittered likefire  in the dark; then he went before them to light them through thelong, dark passage.\"\\n When they came to the spot where lay the deadbird, the mole pushed his broad nose  through the ceiling, the earthgave way, so that there was a large hole, and the  daylight shoneinto the passage.\"\\nIn the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow,  hisbeautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawnup under  his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.It made little Tiny very  sad to see it, she did so love the littlebirds; all the summer they had sung and  twittered for her sobeautifully.\"\\nBut the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs,  andsaid, \"He will sing no more now.\"\\nHow miserable it must be to be born alittle bird!\"\\n I am thankful that none of my children will ever bebirds, for they can do nothing  but cry, \\'Tweet, tweet,\\' and always dieof hunger in the winter.\"\\n  \"Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!\"\\n exclaimed thefield-mouse, \"What is  the use of his twittering, for when winter comeshe must either starve or be frozen  to death.\"\\nStill birds are very highbred.\"\\n  Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned theirbacks on the bird, she  stooped down and stroked aside the softfeathers which covered the head, and kissed  the closed eyelids.\"\\nPerhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the  summer,\"she said; \"and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird.\"\\n  The mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone,and then accompanied  the lady home.\"\\nBut during the night Tiny couldnot sleep; so she got out of bed and  wove a large, beautiful carpet ofhay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and spread  it over him;with some down from the flowers which she had found in thefield-mouse\\'s  room.\"\\nIt was as soft as wool, and she spread some ofit on each side of the bird, so  that he might lie warmly in the coldearth.\"\\n\"Farewell, you pretty little bird,\" said  she, \"farewell;thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when allthe  trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us.\"\\nThen she laidher head on the bird\\'s  breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for itseemed as if something inside the bird  went \"thump, thump.\"\\n It was thebird\\'s heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed  with the cold, andthe warmth had restored him to life.\"\\nIn autumn, all the swallows  flyaway into warm countries, but if one happens to linger, the coldseizes it, it  becomes frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remainswhere it fell, and the cold snow  covers it.\"\\nTiny trembled very much;she was quite frightened, for the bird was large,  a great deallarger than herself,- she was only an inch high.\"\\nBut she took courage,laid  the wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a leafwhich she had used  for her own counterpane, and laid it over thehead of the poor bird.\"\\nThe next morning  she again stole out to seehim.\"\\nHe was alive but very weak; he could only open his  eyes for amoment to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed woodin her  hand, for she had no other lantern.\"\\n\"Thank you, pretty littlemaiden,\" said the sick  swallow; \"I have been so nicely warmed, thatI shall soon regain my strength, and be  able to fly about again in thewarm sunshine.\"\\n  \"Oh,\" said she, \"it is cold out of doors now; it snows andfreezes.\"\\nStay in your warm  bed; I will take care of you.\"\\n  Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf, andafter he had drank, he  told her that he had wounded one of his wingsin a thorn-bush, and could not fly as  fast as the others, who weresoon far away on their journey to warm countries.\"\\nThen  at last hehad fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he cameto be  where she had found him.\"\\nThe whole winter the swallow remainedunderground, and Tiny  nursed him with care and love.\"\\nNeither themole nor the field-mouse knew anything about  it, for they did not likeswallows.\"\\nVery soon the spring time came, and the sun warmed  theearth.\"\\nThen the swallow bade farewell to Tiny, and she opened the holein the ceiling  which the mole had made.\"\\nThe sun shone in upon themso beautifully, that the swallow  asked her if she would go with him;she could sit on his back, he said, and he would  fly away with herinto the green woods.\"\\nBut Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse  verygrieved if she left her in that manner, so she said, \"No, I cannot.\"\\n  \"Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty little maiden,\" saidthe swallow; and he  flew out into the sunshine.\"\\n Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.\"\\nShe wasvery fond of the poor  swallow.\"\\n \"Tweet, tweet,\" sang the bird, as he flew out into the greenwoods, and Tiny felt very  sad.\"\\nShe was not allowed to go out intothe warm sunshine.\"\\nThe corn which had been  sown in the field overthe house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air,  andformed a thick wood to Tiny, who was only an inch in height.\"\\n \"You are going to be married, Tiny,\" said the field-mouse.\"\\n\"Myneighbor has asked for  you.\"\\nWhat good fortune for a poor child likeyou.\"\\nNow we will prepare your wedding  clothes.\"\\nThey must be bothwoollen and linen.\"\\nNothing must be wanting when you are  the mole\\'swife.\"\\n  Tiny had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired fourspiders, who were to weave  day and night.\"\\nEvery evening the molevisited her, and was continually speaking of  the time when thesummer would be over.\"\\nThen he would keep his wedding-day with Tiny;but  now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth, andmade it quite hard,  like a stone.\"\\nAs soon, as the summer was over, thewedding should take place.\"\\nBut Tiny  was not at all pleased; for shedid not like the tiresome mole.\"\\nEvery morning when  the sun rose, andevery evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door,and  as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see theblue sky, she thought  how beautiful and bright it seemed out there,and wished so much to see her dear swallow  again.\"\\nBut he neverreturned; for by this time he had flown far away into the lovely  greenforest.\"\\n When autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit quite ready; and thefield-mouse said to her,  \"In four weeks the wedding must take place.\"\\n  Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeablemole.\"\\n \"Nonsense,\" replied the field-mouse.\"\\n\"Now don\\'t be obstinate, or Ishall bite you with  my white teeth.\"\\nHe is a very handsome mole; thequeen herself does not wear more  beautiful velvets and furs.\"\\nHiskitchen and cellars are quite full.\"\\nYou ought to be  very thankfulfor such good fortune.\"\\n  So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to fetchTiny away to live with  him, deep under the earth, and never again tosee the warm sun, because he did not  like it.\"\\nThe poor child wasvery unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the  beautiful sun,and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at thedoor,  she went to look at it once more.\"\\n \"Farewell bright sun,\" she cried, stretching out her arm towardsit; and then she  walked a short distance from the house; for thecorn had been cut, and only the dry  stubble remained in the fields.\"\\nFarewell, farewell,\" she repeated, twining her arm  round a little redflower that grew just by her side.\"\\n\"Greet the little swallow fromme,  if you should see him again.\"\\n  \"Tweet, tweet,\" sounded over her head suddenly.\"\\nShe looked up, andthere was the  swallow himself flying close by.\"\\nAs soon as he spiedTiny, he was delighted; and then  she told him how unwilling she feltto marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath  the earth, andnever to see the bright sun any more.\"\\nAnd as she told him she wept.\"\\n \"Cold winter is coming,\" said the swallow, \"and I am going tofly away into warmer  countries.\"\\nWill you go with me?\"\\nYou can sit on myback, and fasten yourself on with  your sash.\"\\nThen we can fly away fromthe ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,- far away,  over the mountains,into warmer countries, where the sun shines more brightly\\ufffethanhere; where it is always summer, and the flowers bloom in greaterbeauty.\"\\nFly now  with me, dear little Tiny; you saved my life when Ilay frozen in that dark passage.\"\\n  \"Yes, I will go with you,\" said Tiny; and she seated herself onthe bird\\'s back, with  her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied hergirdle to one of his strongest  feathers.\"\\n Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over forest and oversea, high above the  highest mountains, covered with eternal snow.\"\\nTinywould have been frozen in the cold  air, but she crept under the bird\\'swarm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered,  so that she mightadmire the beautiful lands over which they passed.\"\\nAt length  theyreached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly, and the skyseems so  much higher above the earth.\"\\nHere, on the hedges, and bythe wayside, grew purple,  green, and white grapes; lemons andoranges hung from trees in the woods; and the air  was fragrant withmyrtles and orange blossoms.\"\\nBeautiful children ran along thecountry  lanes, playing with large gay butterflies; and as theswallow flew farther and farther,  every place appeared still morelovely.\"\\n At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it, shaded bytrees of the deepest  green, stood a palace of dazzling white marble,built in the olden times.\"\\nVines  clustered round its lofty pillars, andat the top were many swallows\\' nests, and one  of these was the home ofthe swallow who carried Tiny.\"\\n \"This is my house,\" said the swallow; \"but it would not do for youto live there- you  would not be comfortable.\"\\nYou must choose foryourself one of those lovely flowers,  and I will put you down upon it,and then you shall have everything that you can wish  to make youhappy.\"\\n  \"That will be delightful,\" she said, and clapped her littlehands for joy.\"\\n A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in falling, hadbeen broken into three  pieces.\"\\nBetween these pieces grew the mostbeautiful large white flowers; so the  swallow flew down with Tiny, andplaced her on one of the broad leaves.\"\\nBut how  surprised she was tosee in the middle of the flower, a tiny little man, as white  andtransparent as if he had been made of crystal!\"\\nHe had a gold crownon his head,  and delicate wings at his shoulders, and was not muchlarger than Tiny herself.\"\\nHe  was the angel of the flower; for a tinyman and a tiny woman dwell in every flower;  and this was the king ofthem all.\"\\n \"Oh, how beautiful he is!\"\\n whispered Tiny to the swallow.\"\\n The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, whowas like a giant,  compared to such a delicate little creature ashimself; but when he saw Tiny, he was  delighted, and thought her theprettiest little maiden he had ever seen.\"\\nHe took the  gold crownfrom his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and if shewould  be his wife, and queen over all the flowers.\"\\n This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the sonof a toad, or the mole,  with my black velvet and fur; so she said,\"Yes,\" to the handsome prince.\"\\nThen all  the flowers opened, and out ofeach came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty  it was quite apleasure to look at them.\"\\nEach of them brought Tiny a present; but thebest  gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged to a largewhite fly and they  fastened them to Tiny\\'s shoulders, so that shemight fly from flower to flower.\"\\nThen  there was much rejoicing, andthe little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was  asked tosing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in hisheart he  felt sad for he was very fond of Tiny, and would have likednever to part from her  again.\"\\n \"You must not be called Tiny any more,\" said the spirit of theflowers to her.\"\\n\"It  is an ugly name, and you are so very pretty.\"\\nWewill call you Maia.\"\\n  \"Farewell, farewell,\" said the swallow, with a heavy heart as heleft the warm  countries to fly back into Denmark.\"\\nThere he had anest over the window of a house  in which dwelt the writer of fairytales.\"\\nThe swallow sang, \"Tweet, tweet,\" and from  his song came thewhole story.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  LITTLE TUK  by Hans Christian Andersen  YES, they called him Little Tuk, but it was not his real name;he had called himself  so before he could speak plainly, and he meantit for Charles.\"\\nIt was all very well  for those who knew him, but notfor strangers.\"\\n Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister,Gustava, who was much  younger than himself, and he had to learn hislessons at the same time, and the two  things could not very well beperformed together.\"\\nThe poor boy sat there with his sister  on his lap,and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now and then he looked intohis  geography lesson that lay open before him.\"\\nBy the next morninghe had to learn by heart  all the towns in Zealand, and all thatcould be described of them.\"\\n His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in her arms.Then Tuk ran to  the window, and read so eagerly that he nearly readhis eyes out; for it had become  darker and darker every minute, andhis mother had no money to buy a light.\"\\n \"There goes the old washerwoman up the lane,\" said the mother,as she looked out of  the window; \"the poor woman can hardly dragherself along, and now she had to drag  a pail of water from thewell.\"\\nBe a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old  woman, won\\'tyou?\"\\n  So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he came backinto the room it was  quite dark, and there was not a word said about alight, so he was obliged to go to  bed on his little trucklebedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson,  and ofZealand, and of all the master had told him.\"\\nHe ought really to haveread it  over again, but he could not for want of light.\"\\nSo he putthe geography book under  his pillow, for he had heard that this wasa great help towards learning a lesson,  but not always to bedepended upon.\"\\nHe still lay thinking and thinking, when all at  once itseemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth.\"\\nHe slept andyet he  did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman lookedat him with kind eyes  and said, \"It would be a great pity if you didnot know your lesson to-morrow morning;  you helped me, and now Iwill help you, and Providence will always keep those who  helpthemselves;\" and at the same time the book under Tuk\\'s pillow began tomove about.\"\\n \"Cluck, cluck, cluck,\" cried a hen as she crept towardshim.\"\\n\"I am a hen from Kjoge,\"  and then she told him how manyinhabitants the town contained, and about a battle that  had beenfought there, which really was not worth speaking of.\"\\n \"Crack, crack,\" down fell something.\"\\nIt was a wooden bird, theparrot which is used  as a target as Prastoe.\"\\nHe said there were asmany inhabitants in that town as he had  nails in his body.\"\\nHe was veryproud, and said, \"Thorwalsden lived close to me, and  here I am now,quite comfortable.\"\\n  But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment hefound himself on horseback.\"\\n Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated infront of a richly-attired knight, with a waving  plume, who held him onthe saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old town  ofWordingburg, which was very large and busy.\"\\nThe king\\'s castle wassurrounded by lofty  towers, and radiant light streamed from all thewindows.\"\\nWithin there were songs and  dancing; King Waldemar and theyoung gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing  together.\"\\nMorningdawned, and as the sun rose, the whole city and the king\\'s castle  sanksuddenly down together.\"\\nOne tower after another fell, till at lastonly one  remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerlybeen.\"\\n The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys readin their books, which  they carried under their arms, that it containedtwo thousand inhabitants; but this  was a mere boast, for it did notcontain so many.\"\\n And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether hewas dreaming or not,  for some one stood by him.\"\\n \"Tuk!\"\\nlittle Tuk!\"\\n said a voice.\"\\nIt was a very little person whospoke.\"\\nHe was dressed  as a sailor, and looked small enough to be amiddy, but he was not one.\"\\n\"I bring you  many greetings from Corsor.\"\\nItis a rising town, full of life.\"\\nIt has steamships and  mail-coaches.\"\\nIntimes past they used to call it ugly, but that is no longer true.\"\\n Ilie on the sea-shore,\" said Corsor; \"I have high-roads andpleasure-gardens; I have  given birth to a poet who was witty andentertaining, which they are not all.\"\\nI once  wanted to fit out aship to sail round the world, but I did not accomplish it, though  mostlikely I might have done so.\"\\nBut I am fragrant with perfume, for closeto my gates  most lovely roses bloom.\"\\n  Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors,red and green; but  it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliffclose to the bay, the slopes of which  were quite overgrown withverdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with  pointedtowers.\"\\nSprings of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts,so that  there was a continual splashing.\"\\nClose by sat an old king witha golden crown on his  white head.\"\\nThis was King Hroar of the Springsand near the springs stood the town  of Roeskilde, as it is called.Then all the kings and queens of Denmark went up the  ascent to the oldchurch, hand in hand, with golden crowns on their heads, while  theorgan played and the fountains sent forth jets of water.\"\\n Little Tuk saw and heard it all.\"\\n\"Don\\'t forget the names ofthese towns,\" said King  Hroar.\"\\n All at once everything vanished; but where!\"\\nIt seemed to himlike turning over the  leaves of a book.\"\\nAnd now there stood before himan old peasant woman, who had come  from Soroe where the grass grows inthe market-place.\"\\nShe had a green linen apron thrown  over her head andshoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had been raining  heavily.\"\\nYes, that it has,\" said she, and then, just as she was going totell him a  great many pretty stories from Holberg\\'s comedies, andabout Waldemar and Absalom,  she suddenly shrunk up together, andwagged her head as if she were a frog about to  spring.\"\\n\"Croak,\" shecried; \"it is always wet, and as quiet as death in Soroe.\"\\n Then  littleTuk saw she was changed into a frog.\"\\n\"Croak,\" and again she was an oldwoman.\"\\n \"One must dress according to the weather,\" said she.\"\\n\"It iswet, and my town is just  like a bottle.\"\\nBy the cork we must go in, andby the cork we must come out again.\"\\nIn  olden times I had beautifulfish, and now I have fresh, rosy-cheeked boys in the bottom  of thebottle, and they learn wisdom, Hebrew and Greek.\"\\n  \"Croak.\"\\n How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor,or like the creaking  of great boots when some one is marching,- alwaysthe same tone, so monotonous and  wearing, that little Tuk at lengthfell fast asleep, and then the sound could not annoy  him.\"\\nBut evenin this sleep came a dream or something like it.\"\\nHis little sisterGustava,  with her blue eyes, and fair curly hair, had grown up abeautiful maiden all at once,  and without having wings she couldfly.\"\\nAnd they flew together over Zealand, over green  forests andblue lakes.\"\\n \"Hark, so you hear the cock crow, little Tuk.\"\\n\\'Cock-a-doodle-doo.\\'The fowls are flying  out of Kjoge.\"\\nYou shall have a large farm-yard.You shall never suffer hunger or want.\"\\n The bird of good omen shallbe yours, and you shall become a rich and happy man; your  houseshall rise up like King Waldemar\\'s towers, and shall be richly adornedwith marble  statues, like those at Prastoe.\"\\nUnderstand me well; yourname shall travel with fame  round the world like the ship that wasto sail from Corsor, and at Roeskilde,- Don\\'t  forget the names ofthe towns, as King Hroar said,- you shall speak well and  clearlylittle Tuk, and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleeppeacefully,  as-\"  \"As if I lay in Soroe,\" said little Tuk awaking.\"\\nIt was brightdaylight, and he could  not remember his dream, but that was notnecessary, for we are not to know what will  happen to us in thefuture.\"\\nThen he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson  inthe book, and knew it all at once quite correctly.\"\\nThe old washerwomanput her head  in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said,\"Many thanks, you good child,  for your help yesterday.\"\\nI hope all yourbeautiful dreams will come true.\"\\n  Little Tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but One abovedid.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  OLE THE TOWER-KEEPER  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"IN the world it\\'s always going up and down; and now I can\\'t go upany higher!\"\\n So  said Ole the tower-keeper.\"\\n\"Most people have to tryboth the ups and the downs; and,  rightly considered, we all get tobe watchmen at last, and look down upon life from  a height.\"\\n  Such was the speech of Ole, my friend, the old tower-keeper, astrange, talkative old  fellow, who seemed to speak out everything thatcame into his head, and who for all  that had many a serious thoughtdeep in his heart.\"\\nYes, he was the child of respectable  people, andthere were even some who said that he was the son of a privycouncillor,  or that he might have been.\"\\nHe had studied, too, and hadbeen assistant teacher and  deputy clerk; but of what service was allthat to him?\"\\nIn those days he lived in the  clerk\\'s house, and was tohave everything in the house- to be at free quarters, as  the sayingis; but he was still, so to speak, a fine young gentleman.\"\\nHe wantedto have  his boots cleaned with patent blacking, and the clerk couldonly afford ordinary grease;  and upon that point they split.\"\\nOne spokeof stinginess, the other of vanity, and the  blacking became theblack cause of enmity between them, and at last they parted.\"\\n This is what he demanded of the world in general, namely, patentblacking, and he got  nothing but grease.\"\\nAccordingly, he at lastdrew back from all men, and became a hermit;  but the church tower isthe only place in a great city where hermitage, office and  bread canbe found together.\"\\nSo he betook himself up thither, and smoked hispipe as  he made his solitary rounds.\"\\nHe looked upward and downward,and had his own thoughts,  and told in his own way of what he read inbooks and in himself.\"\\nI often lent him books\\ufffegood books; and youmay know by the company he keeps.\"\\nHe loved neither the  Englishgoverness novels nor the French ones, which he called a mixture ofempty wind  and raisin-stalks: he wanted biographies, anddescriptions of the wonders of, the  world.\"\\nI visited him at least oncea year, generally directly after New Year\\'s day,  and then he alwaysspoke of this and that which the change of the year had put into  hishead.\"\\n I will tell the story of three of these visits, and will reproducehis own words  whenever I can remember them.\"\\n FIRST VISIT  Among the books which I had lately lent Ole, was one which hadgreatly rejoiced and  occupied him.\"\\nIt was a geological book,containing an account of the boulders.\"\\n \"Yes, they\\'re rare old fellows, those boulders!\"\\n he said; \"andto think that we should  pass them without noticing them!\"\\nAnd overthe street pavement, the paving stones, those  fragments of theoldest remains of antiquity, one walks without ever thinking  aboutthem.\"\\nI have done the very thing myself.\"\\nBut now I look respectfullyat every  paving-stone.\"\\nMany thanks for the book!\"\\nIt has filled me withthought, and has made  me long to read more on the subject.\"\\nThe romanceof the earth is, after all, the most  wonderful of all romances.\"\\nIt\\'s apity one can\\'t read the first volume of it, because  it is written in alanguage that we don\\'t understand.\"\\nOne must read in the  differentstrata, in the pebble-stones, for each separate period.\"\\nYes, it is aromance,  a very wonderful romance, and we all have our place in it.\"\\nWegrope and ferret about,  and yet remain where we are; but the ballkeeps turning, without emptying the ocean  over us; the clod on whichwe move about, holds, and does not let us through.\"\\nAnd then  it\\'s astory that has been acting for thousands upon thousands of years andis still  going on.\"\\nMy best thanks for the book about the boulders.Those are fellows indeed!\"\\n They could tell us something worthhearing, if they only knew how to talk.\"\\nIt\\'s really  a pleasure now andthen to become a mere nothing, especially when a man is as  highlyplaced as I am.\"\\nAnd then to think that we all, even with patentlacquer, are  nothing more than insects of a moment on that ant-hillthe earth, though we may be  insects with stars and garters, places andoffices!\"\\nOne feels quite a novice beside  these venerablemillion-year-old boulders.\"\\nOn last New Year\\'s eve I was reading  thebook, and had lost myself in it so completely, that I forgot myusual New Year\\'s  diversion, namely, the wild hunt to Amack.\"\\nAh, youdon\\'t know what that is!\"\\n \"The journey of the witches on broomsticks is well enough known-that journey is taken  on St.\"\\nJohn\\'s eve, to the Brocken; but we have awild journey, also which is national  and modern, and that is thejourney to Amack on the night of the New Year.\"\\nAll  indifferent poetsand poetesses, musicians, newspaper writers, and  artisticnotabilities,- I mean those who are no good,- ride in the New Year\\'snight  through the air to Amack.\"\\nThey sit backwards on their paintingbrushes or quill pens,  for steel pens won\\'t bear them- they\\'re toostiff.\"\\nAs I told you, I see that every  New Year\\'s night, and couldmention the majority of the riders by name, but I should  not like todraw their enmity upon myself, for they don\\'t like people to talkabout  their ride to Amack on quill pens.\"\\nI\\'ve a kind of niece, whois a fishwife, and who,  as she tells me, supplies three respectablenewspapers with the terms of abuse and  vituperation they use, andshe has herself been at Amack as an invited guest; but she  was carriedout thither, for she does not own a quill pen, nor can she ride.\"\\nShehas  told me all about it.\"\\nHalf of what she said is not true, but theother half gives us  information enough.\"\\nWhen she was out there, thefestivities began with a song; each  of the guests had written hisown song, and each one sang his own song, for he thought  that thebest, and it was all one, all the same melody.\"\\nThen those camemarching up,  in little bands, who are only busy with their mouths.There were ringing bells that  rang alternately; and then came thelittle drummers that beat their tattoo in the  family circle; andacquaintance was made with those who write without putting  theirnames, which here means as much as using grease instead of patentblacking; and  then there was the beadle with his boy, and the boywas worst off, for in general he  gets no notice taken of him; then,too, there was the good street sweeper with his  cart, who turns overthe dust-bin, and calls it \\'good, very good, remarkably good.\\'  Andin the midst of the pleasure that was afforded by the mere meetingof these folks,  there shot up out of the great dirt-heap at Amack astem, a tree, an immense flower,  a great mushroom, a perfect roof,which formed a sort of warehouse for the worthy  company, for in ithung everything they had given to the world during the Old Year.\"\\n Outof the tree poured sparks like flames of fire; these were the ideasand thoughts,  borrowed from others, which they had used, and which nowgot free and rushed away like  so many fireworks.\"\\nThey played at \\'thestick burns,\\' and the young poets played at  \\'heart-burns,\\' and thewitlings played off their jests, and the jests rolled away with  athundering sound, as if empty pots were being shattered against doors.\\'It was very  amusing!\\' my niece said; in fact, she said many thingsthat were very malicious but  very amusing, but I won\\'t mention them,for a man must be good-natured, and not a  carping critic.\"\\nBut you willeasily perceive that when a man once knows the rights  of the journeyto Amack, as I know them, it\\'s quite natural that on the New Year\\'snight  one should look out to see the wild chase go by.\"\\nIf in the NewYear I miss certain  persons who used to be there, I am sure tonotice others who are new arrivals; but  this year I omitted takingmy look at the guests, I bowled away on the boulders, rolled  backthrough millions of years, and saw the stones break loose high up inthe north,  saw them drifting about on icebergs, long before Noah\\'s arkwas constructed, saw them  sink down to the bottom of the sea, andre-appear with a sand-bank, with that one that  peered forth from theflood and said, \\'This shall be Zealand!\\' I saw them become  thedwelling-place of birds that are unknown to us, and then become theseat of wild  chiefs of whom we know nothing, until with their axesthey cut their Runic signs into  a few of these stones, which then cameinto the calendar of time.\"\\nBut as for me, I  had gone quite beyondall lapse of time, and had become a cipher and a nothing.\"\\nThen  threeor four beautiful falling stars came down, which cleared the air,and gave my  thoughts another direction.\"\\nYou know what a falling staris, do you not?\"\\nThe learned  men are not at all clear about it.\"\\nIhave my own ideas about shooting stars, as the  common people in manyparts call them, and my idea is this: How often are  silentthanksgivings offered up for one who has done a good and noble action!The thanks  are often speechless, but they are not lost for all that.\"\\nIthink these thanks are  caught up, and the sunbeams bring the silent,hidden thankfulness over the head of  the benefactor; and if it be awhole people that has been expressing its gratitude  through a longlapse of time, the thankfulness appears as a nosegay of flowers, andat  length falls in the form of a shooting star over the good man\\'sgrave.\"\\nI am always  very much pleased when I see a shooting star,especially in the New Year\\'s night, and  then find out for whom thegift of gratitude was intended.\"\\nLately a gleaming star fell  in thesouthwest, as a tribute of thanksgiving to many- many!\"\\n\\'For whom wasthat star  intended?\\' thought I.\"\\nIt fell, no doubt, on the hill bythe Bay of Plensberg, where  the Danebrog waves over the graves ofSchleppegrell, Lasloes, and their comrades.\"\\nOne  star also fell inthe midst of the land, fell upon Soro, a flower on the grave ofHolberg,  the thanks of the year from a great many - thanks for hischarming plays!\"\\n \"It is a great and pleasant thought to know that a shooting starfalls upon our graves.\"\\n On mine certainly none will fall- no sunbeambrings thanks to me, for here there is  nothing worthy of thanks.\"\\nIshall not get the patent lacquer,\" said Ole, \"for my fate  on earthis only grease, after all.\"\\n  SECOND VISIT  It was New Year\\'s day, and I went up on the tower.\"\\nOle spoke ofthe toasts that were  drunk on the transition from the Old Year intothe New- from one grave into the other,  as he said.\"\\nAnd he told me astory about the glasses, and this story had a very deep  meaning.\"\\nItwas this:  \"When on the New Year\\'s night the clock strikes twelve, the peopleat the table rise  up with full glasses in their hands, and drain theseglasses, and drink success to  the New Year.\"\\nThey begin the year withthe glass in their hands; that is a good beginning  for drunkards.\"\\nTheybegin the New Year by going to bed, and that\\'s a good beginning  fordrones.\"\\nSleep is sure to play a great part in the New Year, and theglass likewise.\"\\n Do you know what dwells in the glass?\"\\n asked Ole.\"\\n\"Iwill tell you.\"\\nThere dwell in  the glass, first, health, and thenpleasure, then the most complete sensual delight;  and misfortune andthe bitterest woe dwell in the glass also.\"\\nNow, suppose we count  theglasses- of course I count the different degrees in the glasses fordifferent  people.\"\\n \"You see, the first glass, that\\'s the glass of health, and in thatthe herb of health  is found growing.\"\\nPut it up on the beam in theceiling, and at the end of the year  you may be sitting in the arbor ofhealth.\"\\n \"If you take the second glass- from this a little bird soarsupward, twittering in  guileless cheerfulness, so that a man may listento his song, and perhaps join in \\'Fair  is life!\"\\nno downcast looks!Take courage, and march onward!\\'  \"Out of the third glass rises a little winged urchin, who cannotcertainly be called  an angel child, for there is goblin blood in hisveins, and he has the spirit of a  goblin- not wishing to hurt orharm you, indeed, but very ready to play off tricks  upon you.\"\\nHe\\'llsit at your ear and whisper merry thoughts to you; he\\'ll creep intoyour  heart and warm you, so that you grow very merry, and become awit, so far as the wits  of the others can judge.\"\\n \"In the fourth glass is neither herb, bird, nor urchin.\"\\nIn thatglass is the pause  drawn by reason, and one may never go beyond thatsign.\"\\n \"Take the fifth glass, and you will weep at yourself, you willfeel such a deep emotion;  or it will affect you in a different way.Out of the glass there will spring with a  bang Prince Carnival, ninetimes and extravagantly merry.\"\\nHe\\'ll draw you away with  him; you\\'llforget your dignity, if you have any, and you\\'ll forget more thanyou should  or ought to forget.\"\\nAll is dance, song and sound: the maskswill carry you away with  them, and the daughters of vanity, clad insilk and satin, will come with loose hair  and alluring charms; buttear yourself away if you can!\"\\n \"The sixth glass!\"\\nYes, in that glass sits a demon, in the formof a little, well dressed,  attractive and very fascinating man, whothoroughly understands you, agrees with you  in everything, and becomesquite a second self to you.\"\\nHe has a lantern with him, to  give youlight as he accompanies you home.\"\\nThere is an old legend about a saintwho  was allowed to choose one of the seven deadly sins, and whoaccordingly chose  drunkenness, which appeared to him the least, butwhich led him to commit all the other  six.\"\\nThe man\\'s blood ismingled with that of the demon.\"\\nIt is the sixth glass, and  with thatthe germ of all evil shoots up within us; and each one grows up with astrength  like that of the grains of mustard-seed, and shoots up into atree, and spreads over  the whole world: and most people have no choicebut to go into the oven, to be re-cast  in a new form.\"\\n \"That\\'s the history of the glasses,\" said the tower-keeper Ole,\"and it can be told  with lacquer or only with grease; but I give ityou with both!\"\\n  THIRD VISIT  On this occasion I chose the general \"moving-day\" for my visitto Ole, for on that  day it is anything but agreeable down in thestreets in the town; for they are full  of sweepings, shreds, andremnants of all sorts, to say nothing of the cast-off rubbish  in whichone has to wade about.\"\\nBut this time I happened to see two childrenplaying  in this wilderness of sweepings.\"\\nThey were playing at \"goingto bed,\" for the occasion  seemed especially favorable for thissport.\"\\nThey crept under the straw, and drew an  old bit of raggedcurtain over themselves by way of coverlet.\"\\n\"It was splendid!\"\\n  theysaid; but it was a little too strong for me, and besides, I wasobliged to mount  up on my visit to Ole.\"\\n \"It\\'s moving-day to day,\" he said; \"streets and houses are likea dust-bin- a large  dust-bin; but I\\'m content with a cartload.\"\\nI mayget something good out of that, and  I really did get something goodout of it once.\"\\nShortly after Christmas I was going  up the street;it was rough weather, wet and dirty- the right kind of weather tocatch  cold in.\"\\nThe dustman was there with his cart, which was full,and looked like a sample  of streets on moving-day.\"\\nAt the back ofthe cart stood a fir tree, quite green still,  and with tinsel on itstwigs; it had been used on Christmas eve, and now it was thrown  outinto the street, and the dustman had stood it up at the back of hiscart.\"\\nIt was  droll to look at, or you may say it was mournful- alldepends on what you think of  when you see it; and I thought aboutit, and thought this and that of many things that  were in the cart: orI might have done so, and that comes to the same thing.\"\\nThere  was anold lady\\'s glove, too: I wonder what that was thinking of?\"\\nShall Itell you?\"\\n The glove was lying there, pointing with its little fingerat the tree.\"\\n\\'I\\'m sorry  for the tree,\\' it thought; \\'and I was alsoat the feast, where the chandeliers glittered.\"\\n My life was, so tospeak, a ball night- a pressure of the hand, and I burst!\"\\nMy  memorykeeps dwelling upon that, and I have really nothing else to live for!\\'This is  what the glove thought, or what it might have thought.\"\\n\\'That\\'sa stupid affair with  yonder fir tree,\\' said the potsherds.\"\\nYou see,potsherds think everything is stupid.\"\\n \\'When one is in thedust-cart,\\' they said, \\'one ought not to give one\\'s self airs and  weartinsel.\"\\nI know that I have been useful in the world- far more usefulthan such  a green stick.\\' This was a view that might be taken, and Idon\\'t think it quite a  peculiar one; but for all that, the fir treelooked very well: it was like a little  poetry in the dust-heap; andtruly there is dust enough in the streets on moving-day.\"\\n The way isdifficult and troublesome then, and I feel obliged to run away outof the  confusion; or, if I am on the tower, I stay there and lookdown, and it is amusing  enough.\"\\n \"There are the good people below, playing at \\'changing houses.\\'They toil and tug away  with their goods and chattels, and thehousehold goblin sits in an old tub and moves  with them.\"\\nAll thelittle griefs of the lodging and the family, and the real cares  andsorrows, move with them out of the old dwelling into the new; and whatgain is there  for them or for us in the whole affair?\"\\nYes, there waswritten long ago the good old  maxim: \\'Think on the great moving-day ofdeath!\\' That is a serious thought.\"\\nI hope  it is not disagreeable toyou that I should have touched upon it?\"\\nDeath is the most  certainmessenger, after all, in spite of his various occupations.\"\\nYes,Death is the  omnibus conductor, and he is the passport writer, andhe countersigns our service-book,  and he is director of the savingsbank of life.\"\\nDo you understand me?\"\\nAll the deeds  of our life, thegreat and the little alike, we put into this savings bank; and  whenDeath calls with his omnibus, and we have to step in, and drive withhim into the  land of eternity, then on the frontier he gives us ourservice-book as a pass.\"\\nAs a  provision for the journey, he takesthis or that good deed we have done, and lets it  accompany us; andthis may be very pleasant or very terrific.\"\\nNobody has ever  escapedthe omnibus journey.\"\\nThere is certainly a talk about one who was notallowed  to go- they call him the Wandering Jew: he has to ridebehind the omnibus.\"\\nIf he had  been allowed to get in, he would haveescaped the clutches of the poets.\"\\n \"Just cast your mind\\'s eye into that great omnibus.\"\\nThe society ismixed, for king  and beggar, genius and idiot, sit side by side.\"\\nTheymust go without their property  and money; they have only theservice-book and the gift out of the savings bank with  them.\"\\nBut whichof our deeds is selected and given to us?\"\\nPerhaps quite a littleone,  one that we have forgotten, but which has been recorded- small asa pea, but the pea  can send out a blooming shoot.\"\\nThe poor bumpkin whosat on a low stool in the corner,  and was jeered at and flouted,will perhaps have his worn-out stool given him as a  provision; and thestool may become a litter in the land of eternity, and rise up then  asa throne, gleaming like gold and blooming as an arbor.\"\\nHe who alwayslounged about,  and drank the spiced draught of pleasure, that he mightforget the wild things he had  done here, will have his barrel given tohim on the journey, and will have to drink  from it as they go on;and the drink is bright and clear, so that the thoughts remain  pure,and all good and noble feelings are awakened, and he sees and feelswhat in life  he could not or would not see; and then he has within himthe punishment, the gnawing  worm, which will not die through timeincalculable.\"\\nIf on the glasses there stood  written \\'oblivion,\\' on thebarrel \\'remembrance\\' is inscribed.\"\\n \"When I read a good book, an historical work, I always think atlast of the poetry  of what I am reading, and of the omnibus ofdeath, and wonder, which of the hero\\'s  deeds Death took out of thesavings bank for him, and what provisions he got on the  journey intoeternity.\"\\nThere was once a French king- I have forgotten his name, forthe  names of good people are sometimes forgotten, even by me, but itwill come back some  day;- there was a king who, during a famine,became the benefactor of his people; and  the people raised up to hismemory a monument of snow, with the inscription, \\'Quicker  than thismelts didst thou bring help!\\' I fancy that Death, looking back uponthe  monument, gave him a single snow-flake as provision, asnow-flake that never melts,  and this flake floated over his royalhead, like a white butterfly, into the land of  eternity.\"\\nThus, too,there was Louis XI.\"\\nI have remembered his name, for one remembers  whatis bad- a trait of him often comes into my thoughts, and I wish onecould say the  story is not true.\"\\nHe had his lord high constableexecuted, and he could execute him,  right or wrong; but he had theinnocent children of the constable, one seven and the  other eightyears old, placed under the scaffold so that the warm blood of theirfather  spurted over them, and then he had them sent to the Bastille,and shut up in iron cages,  where not even a coverlet was given them toprotect them from the cold.\"\\nAnd King Louis  sent the executioner tothem every week, and had a tooth pulled out of the head of  each,that they might not be too comfortable; and the elder of the boyssaid, \\'My mother  would die of grief if she knew that my youngerbrother had to suffer so cruelly;  therefore pull out two of myteeth, and spare him.\\' The tears came into the hangman\\'s  eyes, but theking\\'s will was stronger than the tears; and every week two littleteeth  were brought to him on a silver plate; he had demanded them, andhe had them.\"\\nI fancy  that Death took these two teeth out of thesavings bank of life, and gave them to Louis  XI, to carry with himon the great journey into the land of immortality; they fly before  himlike two flames of fire; they shine and burn, and they bite him, theinnocent  children\\'s teeth.\"\\n \"Yes, that\\'s a serious journey, the omnibus ride on the greatmoving-day!\"\\nAnd when  is it to be undertaken?\"\\nThat\\'s just the seriouspart of it.\"\\nAny day, any hour, any  minute, the omnibus may draw up.Which of our deeds will Death take out of the savings  bank, and giveto us as provision?\"\\nLet us think of the moving-day that is notmarked  in the calendar.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  OLE-LUK-OIE, THE DREAM-GOD  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE is nobody in the world who knows so many stories asOle-Luk-Oie, or who can relate  them so nicely.\"\\nIn the evening, whilethe children are seated at the table or in their  little chairs, hecomes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his socks, then  heopens the doors without the slightest noise, and throws a smallquantity of very  fine dust in their eyes, just enough to preventthem from keeping them open, and so  they do not see him.\"\\nThen hecreeps behind them, and blows softly upon their necks,  till theirheads begin to droop.\"\\nBut Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish to hurt them,for he  is very fond of children, and only wants them to be quietthat he may relate to them  pretty stories, and they never are quietuntil they are in bed and asleep.\"\\nAs soon  as they are asleep,Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed.\"\\nHe is nicely dressed; his  coatis made of silken stuff; it is impossible to say of what color, for itchanges  from green to red, and from red to blue as he turns fromside to side.\"\\nUnder each arm  he carries an umbrella; one of them, withpictures on the inside, he spreads over the  good children, and thenthey dream the most beautiful stories the whole night.\"\\nBut  the otherumbrella has no pictures, and this he holds over the naughtychildren so that  they sleep heavily, and wake in the morning withouthaving dreamed at all.\"\\n Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came every night during awhole week to the little  boy named Hjalmar, and what he told him.There were seven stories, as there are seven  days in the week.MONDAY  MONDAY  \"Now pay attention,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie, in the evening, whenHjalmar was in bed, \"and  I will decorate the room.\"\\n  Immediately all the flowers in the flower-pots became large trees,with long branches  reaching to the ceiling, and stretching along thewalls, so that the whole room was  like a greenhouse.\"\\nAll thebranches were loaded with flowers, each flower as beautiful  and asfragrant as a rose; and, had any one tasted them, he would havefound them sweeter  even than jam.\"\\nThe fruit glittered like gold, andthere were cakes so full of plums  that they were nearly bursting.\"\\nItwas incomparably beautiful.\"\\nAt the same time sounded  dismal moans fromthe table-drawer in which lay Hjalmar\\'s school books.\"\\n \"What can that be now?\"\\n said Ole-Luk-Oie, going to the table andpulling out the drawer.\"\\n It was a slate, in such distress because of a false number inthe sum, that it had  almost broken itself to pieces.\"\\nThe pencil pulledand tugged at its string as if it  were a little dog that wanted tohelp, but could not.\"\\n And then came a moan from Hjalmar\\'s copy-book.\"\\nOh, it was quiteterrible to hear!\"\\nOn  each leaf stood a row of capital letters, everyone having a small letter by its side.\"\\n This formed a copy; under thesewere other letters, which Hjalmar had written: they  fancied theylooked like the copy, but they were mistaken; for they were leaning onone  side as if they intended to fall over the pencil-lines.\"\\n \"See, this is the way you should hold yourselves,\" said thecopy.\"\\n\"Look here, you should  slope thus, with a graceful curve.\"\\n  \"Oh, we are very willing to do so, but we cannot,\" saidHjalmar\\'s letters; \"we are  so wretchedly made.\"\\n  \"You must be scratched out, then,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\n \"Oh, no!\"\\n they cried, and then they stood up so gracefully itwas quite a pleasure  to look at them.\"\\n \"Now we must give up our stories, and exercise these letters,\"said Ole-Luk-Oie; \"One,  two- one, two- \" So he drilled them tillthey stood up gracefully, and looked as  beautiful as a copy couldlook.\"\\nBut after Ole-Luk-Oie was gone, and Hjalmar looked  at them inthe morning, they were as wretched and as awkward as ever.TUESDAY  TUESDAY  As soon as Hjalmar was in bed, Ole-Luk-Oie touched, with hislittle magic wand, all  the furniture in the room, which immediatelybegan to chatter, and each article only  talked of itself.\"\\n Over the chest of drawers hung a large picture in a gilt frame,representing a landscape,  with fine old trees, flowers in the grass,and a broad stream, which flowed through  the wood, past severalcastles, far out into the wild ocean.\"\\nOle-Luk-Oie touched  thepicture with his magic wand, and immediately the birds commencedsinging, the  branches of the trees rustled, and the clouds movedacross the sky, casting their  shadows on the landscape beneath them.Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted little Hjalmar up to  the frame, and placed hisfeet in the picture, just on the high grass, and there he  stood withthe sun shining down upon him through the branches of the trees.\"\\nHeran to  the water, and seated himself in a little boat which lay there,and which was painted  red and white.\"\\nThe sails glittered likesilver, and six swans, each with a golden  circlet round its neck,and a bright blue star on its forehead, drew the boat past  the greenwood, where the trees talked of robbers and witches, and the flowersof  beautiful little elves and fairies, whose histories the butterflieshad related to  them.\"\\nBrilliant fish, with scales like silver and gold,swam after the boat, sometimes  making a spring and splashing the waterround them, while birds, red and blue, small  and great, flew after himin two long lines.\"\\nThe gnats danced round them, and the  cockchaferscried \"Buz, buz.\"\\n They all wanted to follow Hjalmar, and all hadsome story  to tell him.\"\\nIt was a most pleasant sail.\"\\nSometimes theforests were thick and dark,  sometimes like a beautiful garden, gaywith sunshine and flowers; then he passed great  palaces of glass andof marble, and on the balconies stood princesses, whose faces  werethose of little girls whom Hjalmar knew well, and had often playedwith.\"\\nOne of  them held out her hand, in which was a heart made ofsugar, more beautiful than any  confectioner ever sold.\"\\nAs Hjalmarsailed by, he caught hold of one side of the sugar  heart, and heldit fast, and the princess held fast also, so that it broke in twopieces.\"\\n Hjalmar had one piece, and the princess the other, butHjalmar\\'s was the largest.\"\\nAt  each castle stood little princesacting as sentinels.\"\\nThey presented arms, and had  golden swords, andmade it rain plums and tin soldiers, so that they must have beenreal  princes.\"\\n Hjalmar continued to sail, sometimes through woods, sometimes asit were through large  halls, and then by large cities.\"\\nAt last he cameto the town where his nurse lived,  who had carried him in her armswhen he was a very little boy, and had always been  kind to him.\"\\nShenodded and beckoned to him, and then sang the little verses she  hadherself composed and set to him,-  \"How oft my memory turns to thee,  My own Hjalmar, ever dear!\"\\n When I could watch thy infant glee,  Or kiss away a pearly tear.\"\\n \\'Twas in my arms thy lisping tongue  First spoke the half-remembered word,  While o\\'er thy tottering steps I hung,  My fond protection to afford.\"\\n Farewell!\"\\nI pray the Heavenly Power  To keep thee till thy dying hour.\"\\nAnd all the birds sang the same tune, the flowers  danced on theirstems, and the old trees nodded as if Ole-Luk-Oie had been tellingthem  stories as well.WEDNESDAY  WEDNESDAY  How the rain did pour down!\"\\nHjalmar could hear it in his sleep;.and when Ole-Luk-Oie  opened the window, the water flowed quite up tothe window-sill.\"\\nIt had the appearance  of a large lake outside, anda beautiful ship lay close to the house.\"\\n \"Wilt thou sail with me to-night, little Hjalmar?\"\\n saidOle-Luk-Oie; \"then we shall  see foreign countries, and thou shaltreturn here in the morning.\"\\n  All in a moment, there stood Hjalmar, in his best clothes, onthe deck of the noble  ship; and immediately the weather became fine.They sailed through the streets, round  by the church, and on everyside rolled the wide, great sea.\"\\nThey sailed till the  landdisappeared, and then they saw a flock of storks, who had left theirown country,  and were travelling to warmer climates.\"\\nThe storks flewone behind the other, and had  already been a long, long time on thewing.\"\\nOne of them seemed so tired that his wings  could scarcelycarry him.\"\\nHe was the last of the row, and was soon left very farbehind.\"\\n At length he sunk lower and lower, with outstretched wings,flapping them in vain,  till his feet touched the rigging of theship, and he slided from the sails to the  deck, and stood before them.Then a sailor-boy caught him, and put him in the hen-house,  with thefowls, the ducks, and the turkeys, while the poor stork stood quitebewildered  amongst them.\"\\n \"Just look at that fellow,\" said the chickens.\"\\n Then the turkey-cock puffed himself out as large as he could,and inquired who he was;  and the ducks waddled backwards, crying,\"Quack, quack.\"\\n  Then the stork told them all about warm Africa, of the pyramids,and of the ostrich,  which, like a wild horse, runs across thedesert.\"\\nBut the ducks did not understand  what he said, and quackedamongst themselves, \"We are all of the same opinion; namely,  that heis stupid.\"\\n  \"Yes, to be sure, he is stupid,\" said the turkey-cock; andgobbled.\"\\n Then the stork remained quite silent, and thought of his home inAfrica.\"\\n \"Those are handsome thin legs of yours,\" said the turkey-cock.\"\\nWhat do they cost a  yard?\"\\n  \"Quack, quack, quack,\" grinned the ducks; but, the stork pretendednot to hear.\"\\n \"You may as well laugh,\" said the turkey; \"for that remark wasrather witty, or perhaps  it was above you.\"\\nAh, ah, is he not clever?He will be a great amusement to us while  he remains here.\"\\n And then hegobbled, and the ducks quacked, \"Gobble, gobble; Quack,  quack.\"\\n  What a terrible uproar they made, while they were having suchfun among themselves!\"\\n Then Hjalmar went to the hen-house; and, opening the door,called to the stork.\"\\nThen  he hopped out on the deck.\"\\nHe had restedhimself now, and he looked happy, and seemed  as if he nodded toHjalmar, as if to thank him.\"\\nThen he spread his wings, and flew  awayto warmer countries, while the hens clucked, the ducks quacked, andthe  turkey-cock turned quite scarlet in the head.\"\\n \"To-morrow you shall be made into soup,\" said Hjalmar to thefowls; and then he awoke,  and found himself lying in his little bed.\"\\n It was a wonderful journey which Ole-Luk-Oie had made him takethis night.THURSDAY  THURSDAY  \"What do you think I have got here?\"\\n said Ole-Luk-Oie, \"Do notbe frightened, and you  shall see a little mouse.\"\\n And then he held outhis hand to him, in which lay a lovely  little creature.\"\\n\"It has cometo invite you to a wedding.\"\\nTwo little mice are going  to enter intothe marriage state tonight.\"\\nThey reside under the floor of yourmother\\'s  store-room, and that must be a fine dwelling-place.\"\\n  \"But how can I get through the little mouse-hole in the floor?\"\\nasked Hjalmar.\"\\n \"Leave me to manage that,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\n\"I will soon make yousmall enough.\"\\n And  then he touched Hjalmar with his magic wand,whereupon he became less and less, until  at last he was not longerthan a little finger.\"\\n\"Now you can borrow the dress of the  tinsoldier.\"\\nI think it will just fit you.\"\\nIt looks well to wear a uniformwhen you  go into company.\"\\n  \"Yes, certainly,\" said Hjalmar; and in a moment he was dressedas neatly as the neatest  of all tin soldiers.\"\\n \"Will you be so good as to seat yourself in your mamma\\'s thimble,\"said the little  mouse, \"that I may have the pleasure of drawing you tothe wedding.\"\\n  \"Will you really take so much trouble, young lady?\"\\n saidHjalmar.\"\\nAnd so in this way  he rode to the mouse\\'s wedding.\"\\n First they went under the floor, and then passed through a longpassage, which was  scarcely high enough to allow the thimble todrive under, and the whole passage was  lit up with thephosphorescent light of rotten wood.\"\\n \"Does it not smell delicious?\"\\n asked the mouse, as she drew himalong.\"\\n\"The wall and  the floor have been smeared with bacon-rind;nothing can be nicer.\"\\n  Very soon they arrived at the bridal hall.\"\\nOn the right stoodall the little lady-mice,  whispering and giggling, as if they weremaking game of each other.\"\\nTo the left were  the gentlemen-mice,stroking their whiskers with their fore-paws; and in the centre  of thehall could be seen the bridal pair, standing side by side, in a hollowcheese-rind,  and kissing each other, while all eyes were upon them;for they had already been  betrothed, and were soon to be married.\"\\nMoreand more friends kept arriving, till the  mice were nearly treadingeach other to death; for the bridal pair now stood in the  doorway, andnone could pass in or out.\"\\n The room had been rubbed over with bacon-rind, like the passage,which was all the  refreshment offered to the guests.\"\\nBut for dessertthey produced a pea, on which a  mouse belonging to the bridal pair hadbitten the first letters of their names.\"\\nThis  was something quiteuncommon.\"\\nAll the mice said it was a very beautiful wedding,  andthat they had been very agreeably entertained.\"\\n After this, Hjalmar returned home.\"\\nHe had certainly been ingrand society; but he had  been obliged to creep under a room, and tomake himself small enough to wear the uniform  of a tin soldier.FRIDAY  FRIDAY  \"It is incredible how many old people there are who would beglad to have me at night,\"  said Ole-Luk-Oie, \"especially those whohave done something wrong.\"\\n\\'Good little Ole,\\'  say they to me, \\'wecannot close our eyes, and we lie awake the whole night and see  allour evil deeds sitting on our beds like little imps, and sprinkling uswith hot  water.\"\\nWill you come and drive them away, that we may havea good night\\'s rest?\\' and  then they sigh so deeply and say, \\'Wewould gladly pay you for it.\"\\nGood-night, Ole-Luk,  the money lies onthe window.\\' But I never do anything for gold.\"\\n \"What shall we  doto-night?\"\\n asked Hjalmar.\"\\n\"I do not know whether you would care togo to another  wedding,\" he replied, \"although it is quite adifferent affair to the one we saw last  night.\"\\nYour sister\\'s largedoll, that is dressed like a man, and is called Herman,  intends tomarry the doll Bertha.\"\\nIt is also the dolls\\' birthday, and they willreceive  many presents.\"\\n  \"Yes, I know that already,\" said Hjalmar, \"my sister always allowsher dolls to keep  their birthdays or to have a wedding when theyrequire new clothes; that has happened  already a hundred times, I amquite sure.\"\\n  \"Yes, so it may; but to-night is the hundred and first wedding,and when that has taken  place it must be the last, therefore this isto be extremely beautiful.\"\\nOnly look.\"\\n  Hjalmar looked at the table, and there stood the little card-boarddoll\\'s house, with  lights in all the windows, and drawn up before itwere the tin soldiers presenting  arms.\"\\nThe bridal pair were seatedon the floor, leaning against the leg of the table,  looking verythoughtful, and with good reason.\"\\nThen Ole-Luk-Oie dressed up  ingrandmother\\'s black gown married them.\"\\n As soon as the ceremony was concluded, all the furniture in theroom joined in singing  a beautiful song, which had been composed bythe lead pencil, and which went to the  melody of a military tattoo.\"\\n \"What merry sounds are on the wind,  As marriage rites together bind  A quiet and a loving pair,  Though formed of kid, yet smooth and fair!\"\\n Hurrah!\"\\nIf they are deaf and blind,  We\\'ll sing, though weather prove unkind.\"\\n  And now came the present; but the bridal pair had nothing toeat, for love was to be  their food.\"\\n \"Shall we go to a country house, or travel?\"\\n asked the bridegroom.\"\\n Then they consulted the swallow who had travelled so far, andthe old hen in the yard,  who had brought up five broods of chickens.\"\\n And the swallow talked to them of warm countries, where the grapeshang in large  clusters on the vines, and the air is soft and mild, andabout the mountains glowing  with colors more beautiful than we canthink of.\"\\n \"But they have no red cabbage like we have,\" said the hen, \"Iwas once in the country  with my chickens for a whole summer, there wasa large sand-pit, in which we could  walk about and scratch as weliked.\"\\nThen we got into a garden in which grew red cabbage;  oh, hownice it was, I cannot think of anything more delicious.\"\\n  \"But one cabbage stalk is exactly like another,\" said the swallow;\"and here we have  often bad weather.\"\\n  \"Yes, but we are accustomed to it,\" said the hen.\"\\n \"But it is so cold here, and freezes sometimes.\"\\n  \"Cold weather is good for cabbages,\" said the hen; \"besides wedo have it warm here  sometimes.\"\\nFour years ago, we had a summer thatlasted more than five weeks, and it  was so hot one could scarcelybreathe.\"\\nAnd then in this country we have no poisonous  animals, and weare free from robbers.\"\\nHe must be wicked who does not consider  ourcountry the finest of all lands.\"\\nHe ought not to be allowed to livehere.\"\\n And then  the hen wept very much and said, \"I have alsotravelled.\"\\nI once went twelve miles in  a coop, and it was not pleasanttravelling at all.\"\\n  \"The hen is a sensible woman,\" said the doll Bertha.\"\\n\"I don\\'t carefor travelling over  mountains, just to go up and come down again.No, let us go to the sand-pit in front  of the gate, and then take awalk in the cabbage garden.\"\\n  And so they settled it.SATURDAY  SATURDAY  \"Am I to hear any more stories?\"\\n asked little Hjalmar, as soonas Ole-Luk-Oie had sent  him to sleep.\"\\n \"We shall have no time this evening,\" said he, spreading out hisprettiest umbrella  over the child.\"\\n\"Look at these Chinese,\" and thenthe whole umbrella appeared like  a large china bowl, with blue treesand pointed bridges, upon which stood little  Chinamen nodding theirheads.\"\\n\"We must make all the world beautiful for to-morrow  morning,\"said Ole-Luk-Oie, \"for it will be a holiday, it is Sunday.\"\\nI mustnow go to  the church steeple and see if the little sprites who livethere have polished the bells,  so that they may sound sweetly.\"\\nThenI must go into the fields and see if the wind  has blown the dustfrom the grass and the leaves, and the most difficult task of  allwhich I have to do, is to take down all the stars and brighten themup.\"\\nI have to  number them first before I put them in my apron, andalso to number the places from  which I take them, so that they maygo back into the right holes, or else they would  not remain, and weshould have a number of falling stars, for they would all tumbledown  one after the other.\"\\n  \"Hark ye!\"\\nMr.\"\\nLuk-Oie,\" said an old portrait which hung on thewall of Hjalmar\\'s bedroom.\"\\n \"Do you know me?\"\\nI am Hjalmar\\'sgreat-grandfather.\"\\nI thank you for telling the boy  stories, but youmust not confuse his ideas.\"\\nThe stars cannot be taken down from thesky  and polished; they are spheres like our earth, which is a goodthing for them.\"\\n  \"Thank you, old great-grandfather,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\n\"I thankyou; you may be the  head of the family, as no doubt you are, but Iam older than you.\"\\nI am an ancient heathen.\"\\n The old Romans andGreeks named me the Dream-god.\"\\nI have visited the noblest houses,and  continue to do so; still I know how to conduct myself both to highand low, and now  you may tell the stories yourself:\" and soOle-Luk-Oie walked off, taking his umbrellas  with him.\"\\n \"Well, well, one is never to give an opinion, I suppose,\" grumbledthe portrait.\"\\nAnd  it woke Hjalmar.SUNDAY  SUNDAY  \"Good evening,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\n Hjalmar nodded, and then sprang out of bed, and turned hisgreat-grandfather\\'s  portrait to the wall, so that it might notinterrupt them as it had done yesterday.\"\\n \"Now,\" said he, \"you musttell me some stories about five green peas that lived in  one pod; orof the chickseed that courted the chickweed; or of the darning needle,who  acted so proudly because she fancied herself an embroideryneedle.\"\\n  \"You may have too much of a good thing,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\n\"Youknow that I like best  to show you something, so I will show you mybrother.\"\\nHe is also called Ole-Luk-Oie  but he never visits any one butonce, and when he does come, he takes him away on his  horse, and tellshim stories as they ride along.\"\\nHe knows only two stories.\"\\nOne ofthese  is so wonderfully beautiful, that no one in the world canimagine anything at all like  it; but the other is just as ugly andfrightful, so that it would be impossible to  describe it.\"\\n ThenOle-Luk-Oie lifted Hjalmar up to the window.\"\\n\"There now, you can  seemy brother, the other Ole-Luk-Oie; he is also called Death.\"\\nYouperceive he is not  so bad as they represent him in picture books;there he is a skeleton, but now his  coat is embroidered with silver,and he wears the splendid uniform of a hussar, and  a mantle of blackvelvet flies behind him, over the horse.\"\\nLook, how he gallopsalong.\"\\n  Hjalmar saw that as this Ole-Luk-Oie rode on, he lifted up oldand young, and carried  them away on his horse.\"\\nSome he seated in frontof him, and some behind, but always  inquired first, \"How stands themark-book?\"\\n  \"Good,\" they all answered.\"\\n \"Yes, but let me see for myself,\" he replied; and they wereobliged to give him the  books.\"\\nThen all those who had \"Very good,\"or \"Exceedingly good,\" came in front of  the horse, and heard thebeautiful story; while those who had \"Middling,\" or  \"Tolerablygood,\" in their books, were obliged to sit behind, and listen to  thefrightful tale.\"\\nThey trembled and cried, and wanted to jump downfrom the horse,  but they could not get free, for they seemedfastened to the seat.\"\\n \"Why, Death is a most splendid Luk-Oie,\" said Hjalmar.\"\\n\"I am notin the least afraid  of him.\"\\n  \"You need have no fear of him,\" said Ole-Luk-Oie, \"if you takecare and keep a good  conduct book.\"\\n  \"Now I call that very instructive,\" murmured thegreat-grandfather\\'s portrait.\"\\n\"It  is useful sometimes to express anopinion;\" so he was quite satisfied.\"\\n These are some of the doings and sayings of Ole-Luk-Oie.\"\\nI hope hemay visit you himself  this evening, and relate some more.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  OUR AUNT  by Hans Christian Andersen  You ought to have known our aunt; she was charming!\"\\nThat is tosay, she was not charming  at all as the word is usually understood;but she was good and kind, amusing in her  way, and was just as any oneought to be whom people are to talk about and to laugh  at.\"\\nShe mighthave been put into a play, and wholly and solely on account of thefact  that she only lived for the theatre and for what was donethere.\"\\nShe was an honorable  matron; but Agent Fabs, whom she used tocall \"Flabs,\" declared that our aunt was  stage-struck.\"\\n \"The theatre is my school,\" said she, \"the source of my knowledge.From thence I have  resuscitated Biblical history.\"\\nNow, \\'Moses\\' and\\'Joseph in Egypt\\'- there are operas  for you!\"\\nI get my universalhistory from the theatre, my geography, and my knowledge  of men.\"\\nOutof the French pieces I get to know life in Paris- slippery, butexceedingly  interesting.\"\\nHow I have cried over \"La FamilleRoquebourg\\'- that the man must drink  himself to death, so that she maymarry the young fellow!\"\\nYes, how many tears I have  wept in the fiftyyears I have subscribed to the theatre!\"\\n  Our aunt knew every acting play, every bit of scenery, everycharacter, every one who  appeared or had appeared.\"\\nShe seemed reallyonly to live during the nine months the  theatre was open.\"\\nSummertimewithout a summer theatre seemed to be only a time that  made her old;while, on the other hand, a theatrical evening that lasted tillmidnight  was a lengthening of her life.\"\\nShe did not say, as otherpeople do, \"Now we shall have  spring, the stork is here,\" or, \"They\\'veadvertised the first strawberries in the  papers.\"\\n She, on thecontrary, used to announce the coming of autumn, with \"Have  youheard they\\'re selling boxes for the theatre?\"\\nnow the performances willbegin.\"\\n  She used to value a lodging entirely according to its proximity tothe theatre.\"\\nIt  was a real sorrow to her when she had to leave thelittle lane behind the playhouse,  and move into the great streetthat lay a little farther off, and live there in a house  where she hadno opposite neighbors.\"\\n \"At home,\" said she, \"my windows must be my opera-box.\"\\nOnecannot sit and look into  one\\'s self till one\\'s tired; one must seepeople.\"\\nBut now I live just as if I\\'d go  into the country.\"\\nIf I wantto see human beings, I must go into my kitchen, and sit  down on thesink, for there only I have opposite neighbors.\"\\nNo; when I lived in mydear  little lane, I could look straight down into the ironmonger\\'sshop, and had only three  hundred paces to the theatre; and now I\\'vethree thousand paces to go, military  measurement.\"\\n  Our aunt was sometimes ill, but however unwell she might feel, shenever missed the  play.\"\\nThe doctor prescribed one day that she shouldput her feet in a bran bath, and  she followed his advice; but shedrove to the theatre all the same, and sat with her  feet in branthere.\"\\nIf she had died there, she would have been very glad.Thorwaldsen  died in the theatre, and she called that a happy death.\"\\n She could not imagine but that in heaven there must be a theatretoo.\"\\nIt had not, indeed,  been promised us, but we might very wellimagine it.\"\\nThe many distinguished actors  and actresses who had passedaway must surely have a field for their talent.\"\\n Our aunt had an electric wire from the theatre to her room.\"\\nAtelegram used to be  dispatched to her at coffee-time, and it used toconsist of the words, \"Herr Sivertsen  is at the machinery;\" for it washe who gave the signal for drawing the curtain up  and down and forchanging the scenes.\"\\n From him she used to receive a short and concise description ofevery piece.\"\\nHis opinion  of Shakspeare\\'s \"Tempest,\" was, \"Madnonsense!\"\\nThere\\'s so much to put up, and the first  scene begins with\\'Water to the front of the wings.\\'\" That is to say, the water had  tocome forward so far.\"\\nBut when, on the other hand, the same interiorscene remained  through five acts, he used to pronounce it asensible, well-written play, a resting  play, which performed itself,without putting up scenes.\"\\n In earlier times, by which name our aunt used to designatethirty years ago, she and  the before-mentioned Herr Sivertsen had beenyounger.\"\\nAt that time he had already been  connected with themachinery, and was, as she said, her benefactor.\"\\nIt used to be  thecustom in those days that in the evening performances in the onlytheatre the town  possessed, spectators were admitted to the partcalled the \"flies,\" over the stage,  and every machinist had one or twoplaces to give away.\"\\nOften the flies were quite  full of goodcompany; it was said that generals\\' wives and privy councillors\\' wiveshad  been up there.\"\\nIt was quite interesting to look down behind thescenes, and to see  how the people walked to and fro on the stagewhen the curtain was down.\"\\n Our aunt had been there several times, as well when there was atragedy as when there  was a ballet; for the pieces in which there werethe greatest number of characters  on the stage were the mostinteresting to see from the flies.\"\\nOne sat pretty much in  the darkup there, and most people took their supper up with them.\"\\nOnce threeapples  and a great piece of bread and butter and sausage fell downright into the dungeon  of Ugolino, where that unhappy man was to bestarved to death; and there was great  laughter among the audience.\"\\nThesausage was one of the weightiest reasons why the  worthy managementrefused in future to have any spectators up in the flies.\"\\n \"But I was there seven-and-thirty times,\" said our aunt, \"and Ishall always remember  Mr.\"\\nSivertsen for that.\"\\n  On the very last evening when the flies were still open to thepublic, the \"Judgment  of Solomon\" was performed, as our auntremembered very well.\"\\nShe had, through the  influence of herbenefactor, Herr Sivertsen, procured a free admission for the  AgentFabs, although he did not deserve it in the least, for he was alwayscutting his  jokes about the theatre and teasing our aunt; but shehad procured him a free admission  to the flies, for all that.\"\\nHewanted to look at this player-stuff from the other side.\"\\n \"Those were his own words, and they were just like him,\" saidour aunt.\"\\n He looked down from above on the \\'Judgment of Solomon,\" and fellasleep over it.\"\\nOne  would have thought that he had come from adinner where many toasts had been given.\"\\n He went to sleep, and waslocked in.\"\\nAnd there he sat through the dark night in the  flies, andwhen he woke, he told a story, but our aunt would not believe it.\"\\n \"The \\'Judgment of Solomon\\' was over,\" he said, \"and all the peoplehad gone away, up  stairs and down stairs; but now the real play began,the after-piece, which was the  best of all,\" said the agent.\"\\n\"Thenlife came into the affair.\"\\nIt was not the \\'Judgment  of Solomon\\' thatwas performed; no, a real court of judgment was held upon thestage.\"\\n  And Agent Fabs had the impudence to try and make our auntbelieve all this.\"\\nThat was  the thanks she got for having got him aplace in the flies.\"\\n What did the agent say?\"\\nWhy, it was curious enough to hear, butthere was malice and  satire in it.\"\\n \"It looked dark enough up there,\" said the agent; \"but then themagic business began\\ufffea great performance, \\'The Judgment in theTheatre.\\' The box-keepers were at their posts,  and every spectator hadto show his ghostly pass-book, that it might be decided if  he was tobe admitted with hands loose or bound, and with or without a muzzle.Grand  people who came too late, when the performance had begun, andyoung people, who could  not always watch the time, were tied upoutside, and had list slippers put on their  feet, with which they wereallowed to go in before the beginning of the next act, and  they hadmuzzles too.\"\\nAnd then the \\'Judgment on the Stage\\' began.\"\\n  \"All malice, and not a bit of truth in it,\" said our aunt.\"\\n The painter, who wanted to get to Paradise, had to go up astaircase which he had himself  painted, but which no man couldmount.\"\\nThat was to expiate his sins against perspective.\"\\n All theplants and buildings, which the property-man had placed, with infinitepains,  in countries to which they did not belong, the poor fellowwas obliged to put in their  right places before cockcrow, if he wantedto get into Paradise.\"\\nLet Herr Fabs see  how he would get in himself;but what he said of the performers, tragedians and  comedians,singers and dancers, that was the most rascally of all.\"\\nMr.\"\\nFabs,indeed!-  Flabs!\"\\nHe did not deserve to be admitted at all, and our auntwould not soil her lips  with what he said.\"\\nAnd he said, did Flabs,that the whole was written down, and it  should be printed when hewas dead and buried, but not before, for he would not risk  havinghis arms and legs broken.\"\\n Once our aunt had been in fear and trembling in her temple ofhappiness, the theatre.\"\\n It was on a winter day, one of those days inwhich one has a couple of hours of daylight,  with a gray sky.\"\\nIt wasterribly cold and snowy, but aunt must go to the theatre.\"\\nA  littleopera and a great ballet were performed, and a prologue and anepilogue into  the bargain; and that would last till late at night.\"\\nOuraunt must needs go; so she  borrowed a pair of fur boots of her lodger-boots with fur inside and out, and which  reached far up her legs.\"\\n She got to the theatre, and to her box; the boots were warm, andshe kept them on.\"\\n Suddenly there was a cry of \"Fire!\"\\n Smoke was comingfrom one of the side scenes, and  streamed down from the flies, andthere was a terrible panic.\"\\nThe people came rushing  out, and ouraunt was the last in the box, \"on the second tier, left-hand side, forfrom  there the scenery looks best,\" she used to say.\"\\n\"The scenes arealways arranged that  they look best from the King\\'s side.\"\\n Aunt wantedto come out, but the people before  her, in their fright andheedlessness, slammed the door of the box; and there sat our  aunt, andcouldn\\'t get out, and couldn\\'t get in; that is to say, she couldn\\'tget into  the next box, for the partition was too high for her.\"\\nShecalled out, and no one heard  her; she looked down into the tier ofboxes below her, and it was empty, and low, and  looked quite near, andaunt in her terror felt quite young and light.\"\\nShe thought  ofjumping down, and had got one leg over the partition, the otherresting on the bench.\"\\n There she sat astride, as if on horseback,well wrapped up in her flowered cloak with  one leg hanging out- aleg in a tremendous fur boot.\"\\nThat was a sight to behold; and  whenit was beheld, our aunt was heard too, and was saved from burning, forthe theatre  was not burned down.\"\\n That was the most memorable evening of her life, and she wasglad that she could not  see herself, for she would have died withconfusion.\"\\n Her benefactor in the machinery department, Herr Sivertsen,visited her every Sunday,  but it was a long time from Sunday toSunday.\"\\nIn the latter time, therefore, she used  to have in a littlechild \"for the scraps;\" that is to say, to eat up the remains of  thedinner.\"\\nIt was a child employed in the ballet, one that certainlywanted feeding.\"\\n The little one used to appear, sometimes as an elf,sometimes as a page; the most  difficult part she had to play was thelion\\'s hind leg in the \"Magic Flute;\" but as  she grew larger she couldrepresent the fore-feet of the lion.\"\\nShe certainly only got  half aguilder for that, whereas the hind legs were paid for with a wholeguilder; but  then she had to walk bent, and to do without fresh air.\"\\nThat was all very interesting  to hear,\" said our aunt.\"\\n She deserved to live as long as the theatre stood, but she couldnot last so long;  and she did not die in the theatre, butrespectably in her bed.\"\\nHer last words were,  moreover, not withoutmeaning.\"\\nShe asked,  \"What will the play be to-morrow?\"\\n  At her death she left about five hundred dollars.\"\\nWe presumethis from the interest,  which came to twenty dollars.\"\\nThis our aunthad destined as a legacy for a worthy old  spinster who had no friends;it was to be devoted to a yearly subscription for a place  in thesecond tier, on the left side, for the Saturday evening, \"for onthat evening  two pieces were always given,\" it said in the will; andthe only condition laid upon  the person who enjoyed the legacy was,that she should think, every Saturday evening,  of our aunt, who waslying in her grave.\"\\n This was our aunt\\'s religion.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  POULTRY MEG\\'S FAMILY  by Hans Christian Andersen  POULTRY MEG was the only person who lived in the new statelydwelling that had been  built for the fowls and ducks belonging tothe manor house.\"\\nIt stood there where once  the old knightly buildinghad stood with its tower, its pointed gables, its moat, and  itsdrawbridge.\"\\nClose by it was a wilderness of trees and thicket; herethe garden had  been, and had stretched out to a great lake, whichwas now moorland.\"\\nCrows and choughs  flew screaming over the old trees,and there were crowds of birds; they did not seem  to get fewer whenany one shot among them, but seemed rather to increase.\"\\nOne heardthe  screaming into the poultry-house, where Poultry Meg sat with theducklings running  to and fro over her wooden shoes.\"\\nShe knew everyfowl and every duck from the moment  it crept out of the shell; and shewas fond of her fowls and her ducks, and proud of  the stately housethat had been built for them.\"\\nHer own little room in the house  wasclean and neat, for that was the wish of the gracious lady to whom thehouse belonged.\"\\n She often came in the company of grand noble guests,to whom she showed \"the hens\\'  and ducks\\' barracks,\" as she calledthe little house.\"\\n Here were a clothes cupboard, and an, arm-chair, and even achest of drawers; and on  these drawers a polished metal plate had beenplaced, whereon was engraved the word  \"Grubbe,\" and this was thename of the noble family that had lived in the house of  old.\"\\nThe brassplate had been found when they were digging the foundation; and theclerk  has said it had no value except in being an old relic.\"\\nThe clerkknew all about the  place, and about the old times, for he had hisknowledge from books, and many a  memorandum had been written and putin his table-drawer.\"\\nBut the oldest of the crows  perhaps knew morethan he, and screamed it out in her own language; but that was  thecrow\\'s language, and the clerk did not understand that, clever as hewas.\"\\n After the hot summer days the mist sometimes hung over themoorland as if a whole lake  were behind the old trees, among which thecrows and the daws were fluttering; and  thus it had looked when thegood Knight Grubbe had lived here- when the old manor house  stood withits thick red walls.\"\\nThe dog-chain used to reach in those days quiteover  the gateway; through the tower one went into a paved passagewhich led to the rooms;  the windows were narrow, and the panes weresmall, even in the great hall where the  dancing used to be; but in thetime of the last Grubbe, there had been no dancing in  the hallwithin the memory of man, although an old drum still lay there thathad served  as part of the music.\"\\nHere stood a quaintly carvedcupboard, in which rare flower-roots  were kept, for my Lady Grubbe wasfond of plants and cultivated trees and shrubs.\"\\nHer  husbandpreferred riding out to shoot wolves and boars; and his littledaughter Marie  always went with him part of the way.\"\\nWhen she was onlyfive years old, she would sit  proudly on her horse, and look saucilyround with her great black eyes.\"\\nIt was a great  amusement to her tohit out among the hunting-dogs with her whip; but her father  wouldrather have seen her hit among the peasant boys, who came running upto stare  at their lord.\"\\n The peasant in the clay hut close by the knightly house had ason named Soren, of the  same age as the gracious little lady.\"\\nTheboy could climb well, and had always to bring  her down the bird\\'snests.\"\\nThe birds screamed as loud as they could, and one of  thegreatest of them hacked him with its beak over the eye so that theblood ran down,  and it was at first thought the eye had beendestroyed; but it had not been injured  after all.\"\\nMarie Grubbe used tocall him her Soren, and that was a great favor, and  was an advantageto Soren\\'s father- poor Jon, who had one day committed a fault, andwas  to be punished by riding on the wooden horse.\"\\nThis same horsestood in the courtyard,  and had four poles for legs, and a singlenarrow plant for a back; on this Jon had  to ride astride, and someheavy bricks were fastened to his feet into the bargain,  that he mightnot sit too comfortably.\"\\nHe made horrible grimaces, and Soren wept  andimplored little Marie to interfere.\"\\nShe immediately ordered thatSoren\\'s father  should be taken down, and when they did not obey her,she stamped on the floor, and  pulled at her father\\'s sleeve till itwas torn to pieces.\"\\nShe would have her way, and  she got her way, andSoren\\'s father was taken down.\"\\n Lady Grubbe, who now came up, parted her little daughter\\'s hairfrom the child\\'s brow,  and looked at her affectionately; but Marie didnot understand why.\"\\n She wanted to go to the hounds, and not to her mother, who wentdown into the garden,  to the lake where the water-lily bloomed, andthe heads of bulrushes nodded amid the  reeds; and she looked at allthis beauty and freshness.\"\\n\"How pleasant!\"\\n she said.\"\\nIn  the gardenstood at that time a rare tree, which she herself had planted.\"\\nItwas called  the blood-beech- a kind of negro growing among the othertrees, so dark brown were  the leaves.\"\\nThis tree required muchsunshine, for in continual shade it would become  bright green like theother trees, and thus lose its distinctive character.\"\\nIn the  loftychestnut trees were many birds\\' nests, and also in the thickets and inthe grassy  meadows.\"\\nIt seemed as though the birds knew that theywere protected here, and that  no one must fire a gun at them.\"\\n Little Marie came here with Soren.\"\\nHe knew how to climb, as wehave already said, and  eggs and fluffy-feathered young birds werebrought down.\"\\nThe birds, great and small,  flew about in terror andtribulation; the peewit from the fields, and the crows and  daws fromthe high trees, screamed and screamed; it was just such din as thefamily  will raise to the present day.\"\\n \"What are you doing, you children?\"\\n cried the gentle lady; \"thatis sinful!\"\\n  Soren stood abashed, and even the little gracious lady looked downa little; but then  he said, quite short and pretty,  \"My father lets me do it!\"\\n  \"Craw-craw!\"\\naway-away from here!\"\\n cried the great black birds, andthey flew away;  but on the following day they came back, for they wereat home here.\"\\n The quiet gentle lady did not remain long at home here on earth,for the good God called  her away; and, indeed, her home was ratherwith Him than in the knightly house; and  the church bells tolledsolemnly when her corpse was carried to the church, and the  eyes ofthe poor people were wet with tears, for she had been good to them.\"\\n When she was gone, no one attended to her plantations, and thegarden ran to waste.\"\\n Grubbe the knight was a hard man, they said;but his daughter, young as she was, knew  how to manage him.\"\\nHe used tolaugh and let her have her way.\"\\nShe was now twelve years  old, andstrongly built.\"\\nShe looked the people through and through with herblack eyes,  rode her horse as bravely as a man, and could fire off hergun like a practiced hunter.\"\\n One day there were great visitors in the neighborhood, thegrandest visitors who could  come.\"\\nThe young King, and his half-brotherand comrade, the Lord Ulric Frederick  Gyldenlowe.\"\\nThey wanted tohunt the wild boar, and to pass a few days at the castle  of Grubbe.\"\\n Gyldenlowe sat at table next to Marie Grubbe, and he took her bythe hand and gave  her a kiss, as if she had been a relation; but shegave him a box on the ear, and told  him she could not bear him, atwhich there was great laughter, as if that had been  a very amusingthing.\"\\n And perhaps it was very amusing, for, five years afterwards,when Marie had fulfilled  her seventeenth year, a messenger arrivedwith a letter, in which Lord Gyldenlowe  proposed for the hand of thenoble young lady.\"\\nThere was a thing for you!\"\\n \"He is the grandest and most gallant gentleman in the wholecountry,\" said Grubbe the  knight; \"that is not a thing to despise.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t care so very much about him,\" said Marie Grubbe; butshe did not despise the  grandest man of all the country, who sat bythe king\\'s side.\"\\n Silver plate, and fine linen and woollen, went off to Copenhagenin a ship, while the  bride made the journey by land in ten days.\"\\nButthe outfit met with contrary winds,  or with no winds at all, forfour months passed before it arrived; and when it came,  my LadyGyldenlowe was gone.\"\\n \"I\\'d rather lie on coarse sacking than lie in his silken beds,\"she declared.\"\\n\"I\\'d  rather walk barefoot than drive with him in acoach!\"\\n  Late one evening in November two women came riding into the townof Aarhuus.\"\\nThey were  the gracious Lady Gyldenlowe (Marie Grubbe)and her maid.\"\\nThey came from the town of  Weile, whither they hadcome in a ship from Copenhagen.\"\\nThey stopped at Lord Grubbe\\'s  stonemansion in Aarhuus.\"\\nGrubbe was not well pleased with this visit.\"\\nMariewas  accosted in hard words; but she had a bedroom given her, and gother beer soup of a  morning; but the evil part of her father\\'s naturewas aroused against her, and she  was not used to that.\"\\nShe was notof a gentle temper, and we often answer as we are  addressed.\"\\nSheanswered openly, and spoke with bitterness and hatred of herhusband,  with whom she declared she would not live; she was toohonorable for that.\"\\n A year went by, but it did not go by pleasantly.\"\\nThere were evilwords between the  father and the daughter, and that ought never to be.Bad words bear bad fruit.\"\\nWhat  could be the end of such a state ofthings?\"\\n \"We two cannot live under the same roof,\" said the father one day.\"\\nGo away from here  to our old manor house; but you had better biteyour tongue off than spread any lies  among the people.\"\\n  And so the two parted.\"\\nShe went with her maid to the old castlewhere she had been  born, and near which the gentle, pious lady, hermother, was lying in the church vault.\"\\n An old cowherd lived in thecourtyard, and was the only other inhabitant of the place.\"\\n In therooms heavy black cobwebs hung down, covered with dust; in thegarden everything  grew just as it would; hops and climbing plantsran like a net between the trees and  bushes, and the hemlock andnettle grew larger and stronger.\"\\nThe blood-beech had been  outgrownby other trees, and now stood in the shade; and its leaves weregreen like  those of the common trees, and its glory had departed.Crows and choughs, in great  close masses, flew past over the tallchestnut trees, and chattered and screamed as  if they had somethingvery important to tell one another- as if they were saying, \"Now  she\\'scome back again, the little girl who had their eggs and their youngones stolen  from them; and as for the thief who had got them down,he had to climb up a leafless  tree, for he sat on a tall ship\\'smast, and was beaten with a rope\\'s end if he did  not behave himself.\"\\n  The clerk told all this in our own times; he had collected itand looked it up in books  and memoranda.\"\\nIt was to be found, with manyother writings, locked up in his  table-drawer.\"\\n \"Upward and downward is the course of the world,\" said he.\"\\n\"Itis strange to hear.\"\\n And we will hear how it went with Marie Grubbe.\"\\nWe need not forthat forget Poultry  Meg, who is sitting in her capital hen-house, inour own time.\"\\nMarie Grubbe sat down  in her times, but not with thesame spirit that old Poultry Meg showed.\"\\n The winter passed away, and the spring and the summer passed away,and the autumn came  again, with the damp, cold sea-fog.\"\\nIt was alonely, desolate life in the old manor  house.\"\\nMarie Grubbe took hergun in her hand and went out to the heath, and shot hares  and foxes,and whatever birds she could hit.\"\\nMore than once she met the noble SirPalle  Dyre, of Norrebak, who was also wandering about with his gun andhis dogs.\"\\nHe was tall  and strong, and boasted of this when they talkedtogether.\"\\nHe could have measured  himself against the deceased Mr.Brockenhuus, of Egeskov, of whom the people still  talked.\"\\nPalle Dyrehad, after the example of Brockenhuus, caused an iron chain with  ahunting-horn to be hung in his gateway; and when he came ridinghome, he used to seize  the chain, and lift himself and his horsefrom the ground, and blow the horn.\"\\n \"Come yourself, and see me do that, Dame Marie,\" he said.\"\\n\\'One canbreathe fresh and  free at Norrebak.\"\\n When she went to his castle is not known, but on the altarcandlestick in the church  of Norrebak it was inscribed that theywere the gift of Palle Dyre and Marie Grubbe,  of Norrebak Castle.\"\\n A great stout man was Palle Dyre.\"\\nHe drank like a sponge.\"\\nHe waslike a tub that could  never get full; he snored like a whole sty ofpigs, and he looked red and bloated.\"\\n \"He is treacherous and malicious,\" said Dame Pally Dyre,Grubbe\\'s daughter.\"\\nSoon she  was weary of her life with him, but thatdid not make it better.\"\\n One day the table was spread, and the dishes grew cold.\"\\nPalle Dyrewas out hunting  foxes, and the gracious lady was nowhere to befound.\"\\nTowards midnight Palle Dyre came  home, but Dame Dyre cameneither at midnight, nor next morning.\"\\nShe had turned her  back uponNorrebak, and had ridden away without saying good-bye.\"\\n It was gray, wet weather; the wind grew cold, and a flight ofblack screaming birds  flew over her head.\"\\nThey were not so homeless asshe.\"\\n First she journeyed southward, quite down into the German land.A couple of golden  rings with costly stones were turned into money;and then she turned to the east, and  then she turned again and wenttowards the west.\"\\nShe had no food before her eyes, and  murmuredagainst everything, even against the good God himself, so wretched washer  soul.\"\\nSoon her body became wretched too, and she was scarcely ableto move a foot.\"\\n The peewit flew up as she stumbled over the mound ofearth where it had built its nest.\"\\n The bird cried, as it always cried,\"You thief!\"\\nyou thief!\"\\n She had never stolen her  neighbor\\'s goods; butas a little girl she had caused eggs and young birds to be  takenfrom the trees, and she thought of that now.\"\\n From where she lay she could see the sand-dunes.\"\\nBy the seashorelived fishermen; but  she could not get so far, she was so ill.\"\\nThegreat white sea-mews flew over her head,  and screamed as the crows anddaws screamed at home in the garden of the manor house.\"\\n The birds flewquite close to her, and at last it seemed to her as if they becameblack  as crows, and then all was night before her eyes.\"\\n When she opened her eyes again, she was being lifted andcarried.\"\\nA great strong man  had taken her up in his arms, and shewas looking straight into his bearded face.\"\\nHe  had a scar over oneeye, which seemed to divide the eyebrow into two parts.\"\\nWeak as  shewas, he carried her to the ship, where he got a rating for it from thecaptain.\"\\n The next day the ship sailed away.\"\\nMadame Grubbe had not beenput ashore, so she sailed  away with it.\"\\nBut she will return, willshe not?\"\\nYes, but where, and when?\"\\n The clerk could tell about this too, and it was not a storywhich he patched together  himself.\"\\nHe had the whole strange historyout of an old authentic book, which we  ourselves can take out andread.\"\\nThe Danish historian, Ludwig Holberg, who has written  so manyuseful books and merry comedies, from which we can get such a goodidea of his  times and their people, tells in his letters of MarieGrubbe, where and how he met  her.\"\\nIt is well worth hearing; but forall that, we don\\'t at all forget Poultry Meg,  who is sittingcheerful and comfortable in the charming fowl-house.\"\\n The ship sailed away with Marie Grubbe.\"\\nThat\\'s where we left off.\"\\n Long years went by.\"\\n The plague was raging at Copenhagen; it was in the year 1711.The Queen of Denmark  went away to her German home, the King quittedthe capital, and everybody who could  do so hurried away.\"\\nThe students,even those who had board and lodging gratis, left  the city.\"\\nOne ofthese students, the last who had remained in the free college, at  lastwent away too.\"\\nIt was two o\\'clock in the morning.\"\\nHe was carryinghis knapsack,  which was better stacked with books and writings thanwith clothes.\"\\nA damp mist hung  over the town; not a person was to beseen in the streets; the street-doors around  were marked with crosses,as a sign that the plague was within, or that all the inmates  weredead.\"\\nA great wagon rattled past him; the coachman brandished hiswhip, and the  horses flew by at a gallop.\"\\nThe wagon was filled withcorpses.\"\\nThe young student kept  his hand before his face, and smelt atsome strong spirits that he had with him on  a sponge in a little brassscent-case.\"\\nOut of a small tavern in one of the streets  there weresounds of singing and of unhallowed laughter, from people who drankthe night  through to forget that the plague was at their doors, andthat they might be put into  the wagon as the others had been.\"\\nThestudent turned his steps towards the canal at  the castle bridge, wherea couple of small ships were lying; one of these was  weighinganchor, to get away from the plague-stricken city.\"\\n \"If God spares our lives and grants us a fair wind, we are goingto Gronmud, near  Falster,\" said the captain; and he asked the nameof the student who wished to go with  him.\"\\n \"Ludwig Holberg,\" answered the student; and the name soundedlike any other.\"\\nBut now  there sounds in it one of the proudest namesof Denmark; then it was the name of a  young, unknown student.\"\\n The ship glided past the castle.\"\\nIt was not yet bright day when itwas in the open  sea.\"\\nA light wind filled the sails, and the youngstudent sat down with his face turned  towards the fresh wind, and wentto sleep, which was not exactly the most prudent thing  he could havedone.\"\\n Already on the third day the ship lay by the island of Falster.\"\\n \"Do you know any one here with whom I could lodge cheaply?\"\\nHolberg asked the captain.\"\\n \"I should think you would do well to go to the ferry-woman inBorrehaus,\" answered  the captain.\"\\n\"If you want to be very civil toher, her name is Mother Soren Sorensen  Muller.\"\\nBut it may happenthat she may fly into a fury if you are too polite to her.\"\\n The manis in custody for a crime, and that\\'s why she manages the ferry-boatherself\\ufffeshe has fists of her own.\"\\n  The student took his knapsack and betook himself to theferry-house.\"\\nThe house door  was not locked- it opened, and he wentinto a room with a brick floor, where a bench,  with a great coverletof leather, formed the chief article of furniture.\"\\nA white hen,  whohad a brood of chickens, was fastened to the bench, and had overturnedthe pipkin  of water, so that the wet ran across the floor.\"\\nTherewere no people either here or  in the adjoining room; only a cradlestood there, in which was a child.\"\\nThe ferry-boat  came back withonly one person in it.\"\\nWhether that person was a man or a woman wasnot  an easy matter to determine.\"\\nThe person in question was wrapped ina great cloak, and  wore a kind of hood.\"\\nPresently the boat lay to.\"\\n It was a woman who got out of it and came into the room.\"\\nShelooked very stately when  she straightened her back; two proud eyeslooked forth from beneath her black eyebrows.\"\\n It was Mother Soren, theferry-wife.\"\\nThe crows and daws might have called out another  namefor her, which we know better.\"\\n She looked morose, and did not seem to care to talk; but this muchwas settled, that  the student should board in her house for anindefinite time, while things looked so  bad in Copenhagen.\"\\n This or that honest citizen would often come to the ferry-housefrom the neighboring  little town.\"\\nThere came Frank the cutler, andSivert the exciseman.\"\\nThey drank a mug  of beer in the ferry-house, andused to converse with the student, for he was a clever  young man,who knew his \"Practica,\" as they called it; he could read Greek andLatin,  and was well up in learned subjects.\"\\n \"The less one knows, the less it presses upon one,\" said MotherSoren.\"\\n \"You have to work hard,\" said Holberg one day, when she wasdipping clothes in the  strong soapy water, and was obliged herselfto split the logs for the fire.\"\\n \"That\\'s my affair,\" she replied.\"\\n \"Have you been obliged to toil in this way from your childhood?\"\\n  \"You can read that from my hands,\" she replied, and held out herhands, that were small  indeed, but hard and strong, with bitten nails.\"\\nYou are learned, and can read.\"\\n  At Christmas-time it began to snow heavily.\"\\nThe cold came on,the wind blue sharp,  as if there were vitriol in it to wash thepeople\\'s faces.\"\\nMother Soren did not let  that disturb her; she threwher cloak around her, and drew her hood over her head.\"\\n Early in theafternoon- it was already dark in the house- she laid wood and turf onthe  hearth, and then she sat down to darn her stockings, for there wasno one to do it  for her.\"\\nTowards evening she spoke more words to thestudent than it was customary  with her to use; she spoke of herhusband.\"\\n \"He killed a sailor of Dragor by mischance, and for that he has towork for three years  in irons.\"\\nHe\\'s only a common sailor, andtherefore the law must take its course.\"\\n  \"The law is there for people of high rank, too,\" said Holberg.\"\\n \"Do you think so?\"\\n said Mother Soren; then she looked into thefire for a while; but  after a time she began to speak again.\"\\n\"Have youheard of Kai Lykke, who caused a church  to be pulled down, and whenthe clergyman, Master Martin, thundered from the pulpit  about it, hehad him put in irons, and sat in judgment upon him, and condemnedhim to  death?\"\\nYes, and the clergyman was obliged to bow his head tothe stroke.\"\\nAnd yet Kai  Lykke went scot-free.\"\\n  \"He had a right to do as he did in those times,\" said Holberg;\"but now we have left  those times behind us.\"\\n  \"You may get a fool to believe that,\" cried Mother Soren; andshe got up and went into  the room where the child lay.\"\\nShe lifted upthe child, and laid it down more comfortably.\"\\n Then she arranged thebed-place of the student.\"\\nHe had the green coverlet, for he felt  thecold more than she, though he was born in Norway.\"\\n On New Year\\'s morning it was a bright sunshiny day.\"\\nThe frosthad been so strong, and  was still so strong, that the fallen snowhad become a hard mass, and one could walk  upon it.\"\\nThe bells of thelittle town were tolling for church.\"\\nStudent Holberg wrapped  himselfup in his woollen cloak, and wanted to go to the town.\"\\n Over the ferry-house the crows and daws were flying with loudcries; one could hardly  hear the church bells for their screaming.Mother Soren stood in front of the house,  filling a brass pot withsnow, which she was going to put on the fire to get drinking  water.She looked up to the crowd of birds, and thought her own thoughts.\"\\n Student Holberg went to church.\"\\nOn his way there and on his returnhe passed by the  house of tax-collector Sivert, by the town-gate.\"\\nHerehe was invited to take a mug  of brown beer with treacle and sugar.\"\\nThediscourse fell upon Mother Soren, but the  tax collector did not knowmuch about her, and, indeed, few knew much about her.\"\\nShe  did notbelong to the island of Falster, he said; she had a little property ofher own  at one time.\"\\nHer husband was a common sailor, a fellow of avery hot temper, and had  killed a sailor of Dragor; and he beat hiswife, and yet she defended him.\"\\n \"I should not endure such treatment,\" said the tax-collector\\'swife.\"\\n\"I am come of  more respectable people.\"\\nMy father wasstocking-weaver to the Court.\"\\n  \"And consequently you have married a governmental official,\"said Holberg, and made  a bow to her and to the collector.\"\\n It was on Twelfth Night, the evening of the festival of theThree Kings, Mother Soren  lit up for Holberg a three-king candle, thatis, a tallow candle with three wicks,  which she had herself prepared.\"\\n \"A light for each man,\" said Holberg.\"\\n \"For each man?\"\\n repeated the woman, looking sharply at him.\"\\n \"For each of the wise men from the East,\" said Holberg.\"\\n \"You mean it that way,\" said she, and then she was silent for along time.\"\\nBut on this  evening he learned more about her than he hadyet known.\"\\n \"You speak very affectionately of your husband,\" observed Holberg,\"and yet the people  say that he ill-uses you every day.\"\\n  \"That\\'s no one\\'s business but mine,\" she replied.\"\\n\"The blows mighthave done me good  when I was a child; now, I suppose, I get them formy sins.\"\\nBut I know what good he  has done me,\" and she rose up.\"\\nWhen I lay sick upon the desolate heath, and no one  would have pityon me, and no one would have anything to do with me, except thecrows  and daws, which came to peck me to bits, he carried me in hisarms, and had to bear  hard words because of the burden he brought onboard ship.\"\\nIt\\'s not in my nature to  be sick, and so I got well.\"\\nEveryman has his own way, and Soren has his; but the horse  must not bejudged by the halter.\"\\nTaking one thing with another, I have lived  moreagreeably with him than with the man whom they called the most nobleand gallant  of the King\\'s subjects.\"\\nI have had the StadtholderGyldenlowe, the King\\'s half-brother,  for my husband; and afterwardsI took Palle Dyre.\"\\nOne is as good as another, each in  his own way, andI in mine.\"\\nThat was a long gossip, but now you know all about me.\"\\n  And with those words she left the room.\"\\n It was Marie Grubbe!\"\\nso strangely had fate played with her.\"\\nShedid not live to see  many anniversaries of the festival of the ThreeKings; Holberg has recorded that she  died in June, 1716; but he hasnot written down, for he did not know, that a number  of great blackbirds circled over the ferry-house, when Mother Soren, as she wascalled,  was lying there a corpse.\"\\nThey did not scream, as if they knewthat at a burial silence  should be observed.\"\\nSo soon as she lay in theearth, the birds disappeared; but on  the same evening in Jutland, atthe old manor house, an enormous number of crows and  choughs wereseen; they all cried as loud as they could, as if they had someannouncement  to make.\"\\nPerhaps they talked of him who, as a little boy,had taken away their eggs  and their young; of the peasant\\'s son, whohad to wear an iron garter, and of the noble  young lady, who endedby being a ferryman\\'s wife.\"\\n \"Brave!\"\\nbrave!\"\\n they cried.\"\\n And the whole family cried, \"Brave!\"\\nbrave!\"\\n when the old house waspulled down.\"\\n \"They are still crying, and yet there\\'s nothing to cry about,\"said the clerk, when  he told the story.\"\\n\"The family is extinct, thehouse has been pulled down, and where  it stood is now the statelypoultry-house, with gilded weathercocks, and the old  Poultry Meg.She rejoices greatly in her beautiful dwelling.\"\\nIf she had not comehere,\"  the old clerk added, \"she would have had to go into thework-house.\"\\n  The pigeons cooed over her, the turkey-cocks gobbled, and theducks quacked.\"\\n \"Nobody knew her,\" they said; \"she belongs to no family.\"\\nIt\\'s purecharity that she  is here at all.\"\\nShe has neither a drake father nora hen mother, and has no descendants.\"\\n  She came of a great family, for all that; but she did not know it,and the old clerk  did not know it, though he had so much written down;but one of the old crows knew  about it, and told about it.\"\\nShe hadheard from her own mother and grandmother about  Poultry Meg\\'s motherand grandmother.\"\\nAnd we know the grandmother too.\"\\nWe saw her  ride,as child, over the bridge, looking proudly around her, as if the wholeworld  belonged to her, and all the birds\\' nests in it; and we sawher on the heath, by the  sand-dunes; and, last of all, in theferry-house.\"\\nThe granddaughter, the last of her  race, had come back tothe old home, where the old castle had stood, where the black  wildbirds were screaming; but she sat among the tame birds, and these knewher and  were fond of her.\"\\nPoultry Meg had nothing left to wish for;she looked forward with  pleasure to her death, and she was oldenough to die.\"\\n \"Grave, grave!\"\\n cried the crows.\"\\n And Poultry Meg has a good grave, which nobody knew except the oldcrow, if the old  crow is not dead already.\"\\n And now we know the story of the old manor house, of its oldproprietors, and of all  Poultry Meg\\'s family.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  SHE WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE mayor stood at the open window.\"\\nHe looked smart, for hisshirt-frill, in which  he had stuck a breast-pin, and his ruffles, werevery fine.\"\\nHe had shaved his chin  uncommonly smooth, although he hadcut himself slightly, and had stuck a piece of  newspaper over theplace.\"\\n\"Hark \\'ee, youngster!\"\\n cried he.\"\\n The boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a poorwasher-woman, who was  just going past the house.\"\\nHe stopped, andrespectfully took off his cap.\"\\nThe peak  of this cap was broken inthe middle, so that he could easily roll it up and put it  in hispocket.\"\\nHe stood before the mayor in his poor but clean andwell-mended clothes,  with heavy wooden shoes on his feet, looking ashumble as if it had been the king  himself.\"\\n \"You are a good and civil boy,\" said the mayor.\"\\n\"I suppose yourmother is busy washing  the clothes down by the river, and you aregoing to carry that thing to her that you  have in your pocket.\"\\nIt isvery bad for your mother.\"\\nHow much have you got in it?\"\\n  \"Only half a quartern,\" stammered the boy in a frightened voice.\"\\n \"And she has had just as much this morning already?\"\\n  \"No, it was yesterday,\" replied the boy.\"\\n \"Two halves make a whole,\" said the mayor.\"\\n\"She\\'s good fornothing.\"\\nWhat a sad thing  it is with these people.\"\\nTell your mothershe ought to be ashamed of herself.\"\\nDon\\'t  you become a drunkard, but Iexpect you will though.\"\\nPoor child!\"\\nthere, go now.\"\\n  The boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while the windfluttered his golden  hair till the locks stood up straight.\"\\nHeturned round the corner of the street into  the little lane that led tothe river, where his mother stood in the water by her washing  bench,beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar.\"\\nThe floodgates at themill had been  drawn up, and as the water rolled rapidly on, the sheetswere dragged along by the  stream, and nearly overturned the bench,so that the washer-woman was obliged to lean  against it to keep itsteady.\"\\n\"I have been very nearly carried away,\" she said; \"it  is agood thing that you are come, for I want something to strengthen me.It is cold  in the water, and I have stood here six hours.\"\\nHave youbrought anything for me?\"\\n  The boy drew the bottle from his pocket, and the mother put itto her lips, and drank  a little.\"\\n \"Ah, how much good that does, and how it warms me,\" she said;\"it is as good as a hot  meal, and not so dear.\"\\nDrink a little, my boy;you look quite pale; you are shivering  in your thin clothes, andautumn has really come.\"\\nOh, how cold the water is!\"\\nI hope  I shallnot be ill.\"\\nBut no, I must not be afraid of that.\"\\nGive me a littlemore, and  you may have a sip too, but only a sip; you must not getused to it, my poor, dear  child.\"\\n She stepped up to the bridge onwhich the boy stood as she spoke, and came  on shore.\"\\nThe water drippedfrom the straw mat which she had bound round her body,  and from hergown.\"\\n\"I work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands,\" said she, \"butI  do it willingly, that I may be able to bring you up honestly andtruthfully, my dear  boy.\"\\n  At the same moment, a woman, rather older than herself, cametowards them.\"\\nShe was  a miserable-looking object, lame of one leg, andwith a large false curl hanging down  over one of her eyes, which wasblind.\"\\nThis curl was intended to conceal the blind  eye, but it madethe defect only more visible.\"\\nShe was a friend of the laundress, andwas  called, among the neighbors, \"Lame Martha, with the curl.\"\\n \"Oh,you poor thing; how  you do work, standing there in the water!\"\\n sheexclaimed.\"\\n\"You really do need something  to give you a littlewarmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you  take.\"\\nAnd then Martha repeated to the laundress, in a very few minutes,all that the  mayor had said to her boy, which she had overheard; andshe felt very angry that any  man could speak, as he had done, of amother to her own child, about the few drops  she had taken; and shewas still more angry because, on that very day, the mayor was  going tohave a dinner-party, at which there would be wine, strong, richwine, drunk  by the bottle.\"\\n\"Many will take more than they ought, butthey don\\'t call that drinking!\"\\n They are all right, you are good fornothing indeed!\"\\n cried Martha indignantly.\"\\n \"And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?\"\\n said thewasher-woman, and  her lips trembled as she spoke.\"\\n\"He says you havea mother who is good for nothing.\"\\n Well, perhaps he is right, but heshould not have said it to my child.\"\\nHow much has  happened to mefrom that house!\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said Martha; \"I remember you were in service there, andlived in the house when  the mayor\\'s parents were alive; how many yearsago that is.\"\\nBushels of salt have been  eaten since then, and peoplemay well be thirsty,\" and Martha smiled.\"\\n\"The mayor\\'s  greatdinner-party to-day ought to have been put off, but the news cametoo late.\"\\nThe  footman told me the dinner was already cooked, when aletter came to say that the  mayor\\'s younger brother in Copenhagen isdead.\"\\n  \"Dead!\"\\n cried the laundress, turning pale as death.\"\\n \"Yes, certainly,\" replied Martha; \"but why do you take it somuch to heart?\"\\nI suppose  you knew him years ago, when you were inservice there?\"\\n  \"Is he dead?\"\\n she exclaimed.\"\\n\"Oh, he was such a kind, good-heartedman, there are not  many like him,\" and the tears rolled down hercheeks as she spoke.\"\\nThen she cried,  \"Oh, dear me; I feel quite ill:everything is going round me, I cannot bear it.\"\\nIs  the bottleempty?\"\\n and she leaned against the plank.\"\\n \"Dear me, you are ill indeed,\" said the other woman.\"\\n\"Come,cheer up; perhaps it will  pass off.\"\\nNo, indeed, I see you are reallyill; the best thing for me to do is to lead  you home.\"\\n  \"But my washing yonder?\"\\n  \"I will take care of that.\"\\nCome, give me your arm.\"\\nThe boy canstay here and take care  of the linen, and I\\'ll come back and finishthe washing; it is but a trifle.\"\\n  The limbs of the laundress shook under her, and she said, \"Ihave stood too long in  the cold water, and I have had nothing to eatthe whole day since the morning.\"\\nO kind  Heaven, help me to get home; Iam in a burning fever.\"\\nOh, my poor child,\" and she burst  into tears.And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to  andwatching the damp linen.\"\\n The two women walked very slowly.\"\\nThe laundress slipped andtottered through the lane,  and round the corner, into the street wherethe mayor lived; and just as she reached  the front of his house, shesank down upon the pavement.\"\\nMany persons came round her,  and LameMartha ran into the house for help.\"\\nThe mayor and his guests came tothe window.\"\\n \"Oh, it is the laundress,\" said he; \"she has had a little drop toomuch.\"\\nShe is good  for nothing.\"\\nIt is a sad thing for her pretty littleson.\"\\nI like the boy very well;  but the mother is good for nothing.\"\\n  After a while the laundress recovered herself, and they led her toher poor dwelling,  and put her to bed.\"\\nKind Martha warmed a mug ofbeer for her, with butter and sugar\\ufffeshe considered this the bestmedicine- and then hastened to the river, washed and  rinsed, badlyenough, to be sure, but she did her best.\"\\nThen she drew the linenashore,  wet as it was, and laid it in a basket.\"\\nBefore evening, shewas sitting in the poor  little room with the laundress.\"\\nThe mayor\\'scook had given her some roasted potatoes  and a beautiful piece offat for the sick woman.\"\\nMartha and the boy enjoyed these good  thingsvery much; but the sick woman could only say that the smell was verynourishing,  she thought.\"\\nBy-and-by the boy was put to bed, in the samebed as the one in which  his mother lay; but he slept at her feet,covered with an old quilt made of blue and  white patchwork.\"\\nThelaundress felt a little better by this time.\"\\nThe warm beer  hadstrengthened her, and the smell of the good food had been pleasantto her.\"\\n \"Many thanks, you good soul,\" she said to Martha.\"\\n\"Now the boyis asleep, I will tell  you all.\"\\nHe is soon asleep.\"\\nHow gentle andsweet he looks as he lies there with his  eyes closed!\"\\nHe does not knowhow his mother has suffered; and Heaven grant he never  may know it.I was in service at the counsellor\\'s, the father of the mayor, andit  happened that the youngest of his sons, the student, came home.\"\\nIwas a young wild  girl then, but honest; that I can declare in thesight of Heaven.\"\\nThe student was merry  and gay, brave andaffectionate; every drop of blood in him was good and honorable;  abetter man never lived on earth.\"\\nHe was the son of the house, and Iwas only a maid;  but he loved me truly and honorably, and he toldhis mother of it.\"\\nShe was to him as  an angel upon earth; she was sowise and loving.\"\\nHe went to travel, and before he started  he placeda gold ring on my finger; and as soon as he was out of the house, mymistress  sent for me.\"\\nGently and earnestly she drew me to her, andspake as if an angel were  speaking.\"\\nShe showed me clearly, in spiritand in truth, the difference there was  between him and me.\"\\n\\'He ispleased now,\\' she said, \\'with your pretty face;

but I knewshe was right, and the thought pressed heavily upon me.\"\\nI  kissed herhand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to myroom,  and threw myself on the bed.\"\\nI passed through a dreadfulnight; God knows what I  suffered, and how I struggled.\"\\nThe followingSunday I went to the house of God to pray  for light to direct my path.It seemed like a providence that as I stepped out of church  Ericcame towards me; and then there remained not a doubt in my mind.\"\\nWewere suited  to each other in rank and circumstances.\"\\nHe was, eventhen, a man of good means.\"\\nI  went up to him, and took his hand, andsaid, \\'Do you still feel the same for me?\\' \\'Yes;

but the misfortunes of this world, were  unknown to methen.\"\\nAt Michaelmas we were married, and for the first year  everythingwent well with us.\"\\nWe had a journeyman and an apprentice, and you wereour  servant, Martha.\"\\n  \"Ah, yes, and you were a dear, good mistress,\" said Martha, \"Ishall never forget how  kind you and your husband were to me.\"\\n  \"Yes, those were happy years when you were with us, although wehad no children at  first.\"\\nThe student I never met again.\"\\nYet I saw himonce, although he did not see me.\"\\n He came to his mother\\'s funeral.\"\\nIsaw him, looking pale as death, and deeply troubled,  standing at hergrave;

so itwas bought.\"\\nThe builder and carpenter made an  estimate that the newhouse would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to build.\"\\nEric  hadcredit, so he borrowed the money in the chief town.\"\\nBut the captain,who was bringing  it to him, was shipwrecked, and the money lost.Just about this time, my dear sweet  boy, who lies sleeping there,was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe  lingering illness.For three quarters of a year I was obliged to dress and undress  him.We were backward in our payments, we borrowed more money, and all thatwe had was  lost and sold, and then my husband died.\"\\nSince then Ihave worked, toiled, and striven  for the sake of the child.\"\\nI havescrubbed and washed both coarse and fine linen, but  I have not beenable to make myself better off; and it was God\\'s will.\"\\nIn His own timeHe  will take me to Himself, but I know He will never forsake myboy.\"\\n Then she fell asleep.\"\\n In the morning she felt much refreshed,and strong enough, as she thought, to go on  with her work.\"\\nBut as soonas she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized  her; sheclutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward,and  fell.\"\\nHer head rested on dry land, but her feet were in the water;her wooden shoes,  which were only tied on by a wisp of straw, werecarried away by the stream, and thus  she was found by Martha whenshe came to bring her some coffee.\"\\n In the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by themayor, to say that she  must come to him immediately, as he hadsomething to tell her.\"\\nIt was too late; a surgeon  had been sent for toopen a vein in her arm, but the poor woman was dead.\"\\n \"She has drunk herself to death,\" said the cruel mayor.\"\\nIn theletter, containing the  news of his brother\\'s death, it was stated thathe had left in his will a legacy of  six hundred dollars to theglovemaker\\'s widow, who had been his mother\\'s maid, to be  paid withdiscretion, in large or small sums to the widow or her child.\"\\n \"There was something between my brother and her, I remember,\" saidthe mayor; \"it is  a good thing that she is out of the way, for now theboy will have the whole.\"\\nI will  place him with honest people tobring him up, that he may become a respectable working  man.\"\\n And theblessing of God rested upon these words.\"\\nThe mayor sent for the boy tocome  to him, and promised to take care of him, but most cruellyadded that it was a good  thing that his mother was dead, for \"shewas good for nothing.\"\\n They carried her to  the churchyard, thechurchyard in which the poor were buried.\"\\nMartha strewed sand on  thegrave and planted a rose-tree upon it, and the boy stood by her side.\"\\n \"Oh, my poor mother!\"\\n he cried, while the tears rolled down hischeeks.\"\\n\"Is it true  what they say, that she was good for nothing?\"\\n  \"No, indeed, it is not true,\" replied the old servant, raising hereyes to heaven;

\"not in reality anyposition.\"\\nThere are many  in a town far above a master builder inposition.\"\\nYou may be an upright man, but even  as a master you willonly be ranked among common men.\"\\nI know better what to do than  that.\"\\nIwill be an architect, which will place me among those who possessriches and  intellect, and who speculate in art.\"\\nI shall certainly haveto rise by my own endeavors  from a bricklayer\\'s laborer, or as acarpenter\\'s apprentice- a lad wearing a paper  cap, although I now weara silk hat.\"\\nI shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the  journeymen,and they will call me \\'thou,\\' which will be an insult.\"\\nI shallendure it,  however, for I shall look upon it all as a mererepresentation, a masquerade, a mummery,  which to-morrow, that is,when I myself as a journeyman, shall have served my time,  will vanish,and I shall go my way, and all that has passed will be nothing tome.\"\\nThen  I shall enter the academy, and get instructed in drawing, andbe called an architect.\"\\n I may even attain to rank, and havesomething placed before or after my name, and I  shall build asothers have done before me.\"\\nBy this there will be always \\'something\\'to  make me remembered, and is not that worth living for?\"\\n  \"Not in my opinion,\" said the fourth; \"I will never follow thelead of others, and  only imitate what they have done.\"\\nI will be agenius, and become greater than all of  you together.\"\\nI will create anew style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting  housessuitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in the country,and thus  suit national feeling and the developments of the age,besides building a storey for  my own genius.\"\\n  \"But supposing the climate and the material are not good formuch,\" said the fifth  brother, \"that would be very unfortunate foryou, and have an influence over your  experiments.\"\\nNationality mayassert itself until it becomes affectation, and the  developments ofa century may run wild, as youth often does.\"\\nI see clearly that noneof  you will ever really be anything worth notice, however you maynow fancy it.\"\\nBut do  as you like, I shall not imitate you.\"\\nI mean tokeep clear of all these things, and  criticize what you do.\"\\nIn everyaction something imperfect may be discovered,  something not right,which I shall make it my business to find out and expose; that  will besomething, I fancy.\"\\n And he kept his word, and became a critic.\"\\n People said of this fifth brother, \"There is something veryprecise about him; he has  a good head-piece, but he does nothing.\"\\n Andon that very account they thought he must  be something.\"\\n Now, you see, this is a little history which will never end; aslong as the world exists,  there will always be men like these fivebrothers.\"\\nAnd what became of them?\"\\nWere they  each nothing orsomething?\"\\nYou shall hear; it is quite a history.\"\\n The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered thateach brick, when  finished, brought him in a small coin, if only acopper one; and many copper pieces,  if placed one upon another, can bechanged into a shining shilling; and at whatever  door a person knocks,who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker\\'s,  thebutcher\\'s, or the tailor\\'s, the door flies open, and he can get all hewants.\"\\nSo  you see the value of bricks.\"\\nSome of the bricks, however,crumbled to pieces, or were  broken, but the elder brother found ause for even these.\"\\n On the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the sea-coast, apoor woman named  Margaret wished to build herself a house, so allthe imperfect bricks were given to  her, and a few whole ones withthem; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted man,  although he neverachieved anything higher than making bricks.\"\\nThe poor woman  builtherself a little house- it was small and narrow, and the window wasquite crooked,  the door too low, and the straw roof might have beenbetter thatched.\"\\nBut still it  was a shelter, and from within you couldlook far over the sea, which dashed wildly  against the sea-wall onwhich the little house was built.\"\\nThe salt waves sprinkled  their whitefoam over it, but it stood firm, and remained long after he who hadgiven  the bricks to build it was dead and buried.\"\\n The second brother of course knew better how to build than poorMargaret, for he served  an apprenticeship to learn it.\"\\nWhen his timewas up, he packed up his knapsack, and  went on his travels, singingthe journeyman\\'s song,-  \"While young, I can wander without a care,  And build new houses everywhere;  Fair and bright are my dreams of home,  Always thought of wherever I roam.\"\\n Hurrah for a workman\\'s life of glee!\"\\n There\\'s a loved one at home who thinks of me;  Home and friends I can ne\\'er forget,  And I mean to be a master yet.\"\\nAnd that is what he did.\"\\nOn his return home, he became  a masterbuilder,- built one house after another in the town, till theyformed quite  a street, which, when finished, became really an ornamentto the town.\"\\nThese houses  built a house for him in return, which wasto be his own.\"\\nBut how can houses build  a house?\"\\nIf the houses wereasked, they could not answer; but the people would  understand, andsay, \"Certainly the street built his house for him.\"\\n It was not  verylarge, and the floor was of lime; but when he danced with his bride onthe  lime-covered floor, it was to him white and shining, and fromevery stone in the wall  flowers seemed to spring forth and decoratethe room as with the richest tapestry.\"\\n It was really a pretty house,and in it were a happy pair.\"\\nThe flag of the corporation  flutteredbefore it, and the journeymen and apprentices shouted \"Hurrah.\"\\n He hadgained  his position, he had made himself something, and at last hedied, which was \"something\"  too.\"\\n Now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had beenfirst a carpenter\\'s  apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as anerrand boy, but afterwards went to the  academy, and risen to be anarchitect, a high and noble gentleman.\"\\nAh yes, the houses  of the newstreet, which the brother who was a master builder erected, may havebuilt  his house for him, but the street received its name from thearchitect, and the  handsomest house in the street became his property.That was something, and he was  \"something,\" for he had a list oftitles before and after his name.\"\\nHis children were  called \"wellborn,\"and when he died, his widow was treated as a lady of position,  andthat was \"something.\"\\n His name remained always written at the cornerof the street,  and lived in every one\\'s mouth as its name.\"\\nYes, thisalso was something.\"\\n  And what about the genius of the family- the fourth brother- whowanted to invent  something new and original?\"\\nHe tried to build a loftystorey himself, but it fell to  pieces, and he fell with it and brokehis neck.\"\\nHowever, he had a splendid funeral,  with the city flagsand music in the procession; flowers were strewn on the  pavement,and three orations were spoken over his grave, each one longer thanthe other.\"\\n He would have liked this very much during his life, as wellas the poems about him  in the papers, for he liked nothing so wellas to be talked of.\"\\nA monument was also  erected over his grave.\"\\nIt wasonly another storey over him, but that was \"something,\"  Now he wasdead, like the three other brothers.\"\\n The youngest- the critic- outlived them all, which was quite rightfor him.\"\\nIt gave  him the opportunity of having the last word, which tohim was of great importance.\"\\n People always said he had a goodhead-piece.\"\\nAt last his hour came, and he died, and  arrived at thegates of heaven.\"\\nSouls always enter these gates in pairs; so hefound  himself standing and waiting for admission with another; and whoshould it be but old  dame Margaret, from the house on the dyke!\"\\n\"It isevidently for the sake of contrast  that I and this wretched soulshould arrive here exactly at the same time,\" said the  critic.\"\\n\"Praywho are you, my good woman?\"\\n said he; \"do you want to get in heretoo?\"\\n  And the old woman curtsied as well as she could; she thought itmust be St.\"\\nPeter himself  who spoke to her.\"\\n\"I am a poor old woman,\"she said, \"without my family.\"\\nI am old  Margaret, that lived in thehouse on the dyke.\"\\n  \"Well, and what have you done- what great deed have youperformed down below?\"\\n  \"I have done nothing at all in the world that could give me aclaim to have these doors  open for me,\" she said.\"\\n\"It would be onlythrough mercy that I can be allowed to slip  in through the gate.\"\\n  \"In what manner did you leave the world?\"\\n he asked, just for thesake of saying  something; for it made him feel very weary to standthere and wait.\"\\n \"How I left the world?\"\\n she replied; \"why, I can scarcely tellyou.\"\\nDuring the last  years of my life I was sick and miserable, andI was unable to bear creeping out of  bed suddenly into the frost andcold.\"\\nLast winter was a hard winter, but I have got  over it all now.There were a few mild days, as your honor, no doubt, knows.\"\\nThe icelay  thickly on the lake, as far one could see.\"\\nThe people came fromthe town, and walked  upon it, and they say there were dancing andskating upon it, I believe, and a great  feasting.\"\\nThe sound ofbeautiful music came into my poor little room where I lay.\"\\n Towardsevening, when the moon rose beautifully, though not yet in her fullsplendor,  I glanced from my bed over the wide sea; and there, justwhere the sea and sky met,  rose a curious white cloud.\"\\nI lay lookingat the cloud till I observed a little black  spot in the middle ofit, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what  itmeant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is notoften seen, I knew  it, and a shuddering seized me.\"\\nTwice in my lifehad I seen this same thing, and I  knew that there would be an awfulstorm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm  the poor people whowere now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry.\"\\n Youngand old, the whole city, were there; who was to warn them, if no onenoticed the  sign, or knew what it meant as I did?\"\\nI was so alarmed,that I felt more strength and  life than I had done for some time.\"\\nIgot out of bed, and reached the window; I could  not crawl anyfarther from weakness and exhaustion; but I managed to open thewindow.\"\\n I saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice;I saw the beautiful  flags waving in the wind; I heard the boysshouting, \\'Hurrah!\\' and the lads and lasses  singing, and everythingfull of merriment and joy.\"\\nBut there was the white cloud with  theblack spot hanging over them.\"\\nI cried out as loudly as I could, but noone heard  me; I was too far off from the people.\"\\nSoon would thestorm burst, the ice break, and  all who were on it be irretrievablylost.\"\\nThey could not hear me, and to go to them  was quite out of mypower.\"\\nOh, if I could only get them safe on land!\"\\nThen came  thethought, as if from heaven, that I would rather set fire to my bed,and let the  house be burnt down, than that so many people shouldperish miserably.\"\\nI got a light,  and in a few moments the red flamesleaped up as a beacon to them.\"\\nI escaped fortunately  as far as thethreshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I couldgo  no farther.\"\\nThe flames rushed out towards me, flickered on thewindow, and rose high  above the roof.\"\\nThe people on the ice becameaware of the fire, and ran as fast as  possible to help a poor sickwoman, who, as they thought, was being burnt to death.\"\\n There was notone who did not run.\"\\nI heard them coming, and I also at the sametime  was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavyartillery.\"\\nThe spring  flood was lifting the ice covering, whichbrake into a thousand pieces.\"\\nBut the people  had reached the sea-wall,where the sparks were flying round.\"\\nI had saved them all;  but Isuppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up hereto the gates  of paradise.\"\\nI am told they are open to poor creaturessuch as I am, and I have now  no house left on earth; but I do notthink that will give me a claim to be admitted  here.\"\\n  Then the gates were opened, and an angel led the old woman in.\"\\nShehad dropped one  little straw out of her straw bed, when she set iton fire to save the lives of so  many.\"\\nIt had been changed into thepurest gold- into gold that constantly grew and  expanded intoflowers and fruit of immortal beauty.\"\\n \"See,\" said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, \"this iswhat the poor woman  has brought.\"\\nWhat dost thou bring?\"\\nI know thouhast accomplished nothing, not even  made a single brick.\"\\nEven ifthou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very  likely, whenmade, the brick would be useless, unless done with a good will,which is  always something.\"\\nBut thou canst not return to earth, and Ican do nothing for thee.\"\\n  Then the poor soul, the old mother who had lived in the house onthe dyke, pleaded  for him.\"\\nShe said, \"His brother made all the stoneand bricks, and sent them to me  to build my poor little dwelling,which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like  me.\"\\nCould not allthese bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him?\"\\n Itis an act of mercy; he is wanting it now; and here is the veryfountain of mercy.\"\\n  \"Then,\" said the angel, \"thy brother, he who has been lookedupon as the meanest of  you all, he whose honest deeds to thee appearedso humble,- it is he who has sent you  this heavenly gift.\"\\nThou shaltnot be turned away.\"\\nThou shalt have permission to stand  without thegate and reflect, and repent of thy life on earth; but thou shaltnot be  admitted here until thou hast performed one good deed ofrepentance, which will indeed  for thee be something.\"\\n  \"I could have expressed that better,\" thought the critic; but hedid not say it aloud,  which for him was SOMETHING, after all.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  SOUP FROM A SAUSAGE SKEWER  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"WE had such an excellent dinner yesterday,\" said an old mouseof the female sex to  another who had not been present at the feast.\"\\n\"Isat number twenty-one below the  mouse-king, which was not a bad place.Shall I tell you what we had?\"\\nEverything was  first rate.\"\\nMouldy bread,tallow candle, and sausage.\"\\nAnd then, when we had finished  thatcourse, the same came on all over again; it was as good as two feasts.We were  very sociable, and there was as much joking and fun as if wehad been all of one family  circle.\"\\nNothing was left but the sausageskewers, and this formed a subject of  conversation, till at last itturned to the proverb, \\'Soup from sausage skins;\\' or,  as the people inthe neighboring country call it, \\'Soup from a sausage skewer.\\'  Everyone had heard the proverb, but no one had ever tasted the soup, muchless prepared  it.\"\\nA capital toast was drunk to the inventor of thesoup, and some one said he ought  to be made a relieving officer to thepoor.\"\\nWas not that witty?\"\\nThen the old mouse-king  rose and promisedthat the young lady-mouse who should learn how best to prepare  thismuch-admired and savory soup should be his queen, and a year and a dayshould be  allowed for the purpose.\"\\n  \"That was not at all a bad proposal,\" said the other mouse; \"buthow is the soup made?\"\\n  \"Ah, that is more than I can tell you.\"\\nAll the young lady micewere asking the same  question.\"\\nThey wished very much to be queen,but they did not want to take the trouble  of going out into theworld to learn how to make soup, which was absolutely necessary  tobe done first.\"\\nBut it is not every one who would care to leave herfamily, or her  happy corner by the fire-side at home, even to bemade queen.\"\\nIt is not always easy  to find bacon and cheese-rind inforeign lands every day, and it is not pleasant to  have to endurehunger, and be perhaps, after all, eaten up alive by the cat.\"\\n  \"Most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged themajority from going out  into the world to collect the requiredinformation.\"\\nOnly four mice gave notice that  they were ready to setout on the journey.\"\\nThey were young and lively, but poor.\"\\nEach  of themwished to visit one of the four divisions of the world, so that itmight be  seen which was the most favored by fortune.\"\\nEvery one tooka sausage skewer as a  traveller\\'s staff, and to remind them of theobject of their journey.\"\\nThey left home  early in May, and none of themreturned till the first of May in the following year,  and then onlythree of them.\"\\nNothing was seen or heard of the fourth, although theday  of decision was close at hand.\"\\n\"Ah, yes, there is always sometrouble mixed up with  the greatest pleasure,\" said the mouse-king; buthe gave orders that all the mice  within a circle of many milesshould be invited at once.\"\\nThey were to assemble in the  kitchen, andthe three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them, while asausage  skewer, covered with crape, was to be stuck up instead ofthe missing mouse.\"\\nNo one  dared to express an opinion until the kingspoke, and desired one of them to go on  with her story.\"\\nAnd now weshall hear what she said.\"\\n WHAT THE FIRST LITTLE MOUSE  SAW AND HEARD ON HER TRAVELS  \"When I first went out into the world,\" said the little mouse,\"I fancied, as so many  of my age do, that I already knew everything,but it was not so.\"\\nIt takes years to  acquire great knowledge.\"\\nI wentat once to sea in a ship bound for the north.\"\\nI had  been told that theship\\'s cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea, and it is  easyenough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon, and large tubs ofsalt meat and  mouldy flour.\"\\nThere I found plenty of delicate food, butno opportunity for learning  how to make soup from a sausage skewer.\"\\nWesailed on for many days and nights; the  ship rocked fearfully, andwe did not escape without a wetting.\"\\nAs soon as we arrived  at the portto which the ship was bound, I left it, and went on shore at a placefar  towards the north.\"\\nIt is a wonderful thing to leave your ownlittle corner at home,  to hide yourself in a ship where there are sureto be some nice snug corners for shelter,  then suddenly to findyourself thousands of miles away in a foreign land.\"\\nI saw  largepathless forests of pine and birch trees, which smelt so strong that Isneezed  and thought of sausage.\"\\nThere were great lakes also whichlooked as black as ink at  a distance, but were quite clear when I cameclose to them.\"\\nLarge swans were floating  upon them, and I thought atfirst they were only foam, they lay so still; but when  I saw them walkand fly, I knew what they were directly.\"\\nThey belong to the goosespecies,  one can see that by their walk.\"\\nNo one can attempt todisguise family descent.\"\\nI kept  with my own kind, and associatedwith the forest and field mice, who, however, knew  very little,especially about what I wanted to know, and which had actually made  metravel abroad.\"\\nThe idea that soup could be made from a sausageskewer was to them  such an out-of-the-way, unlikely thought, that itwas repeated from one to another  through the whole forest.\"\\nTheydeclared that the problem would never be solved, that  the thing was animpossibility.\"\\nHow little I thought that in this place, on the  veryfirst night, I should be initiated into the manner of its preparation.\"\\n \"It was the height of summer, which the mice told me was thereason that the forest  smelt so strong, and that the herbs were sofragrant, and the lakes with the white  swimming swans so dark, and yetso clear.\"\\nOn the margin of the wood, near to three  or four houses, apole, as large as the mainmast of a ship, had been erected, and fromthe  summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons; it wasthe Maypole.\"\\nLads and  lasses danced round the pole, and tried to outdothe violins of the musicians with  their singing.\"\\nThey were as merry asever at sunset and in the moonlight, but I took  no part in themerry-making.\"\\nWhat has a little mouse to do with a Maypole dance?\"\\nIsat  in the soft moss, and held my sausage skewer tight.\"\\nThe moon threwits beams  particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered withexceedingly fine moss.\"\\nI may  almost venture to say that it was as fineand soft as the fur of the mouse-king, but  it was green, which is acolor very agreeable to the eye.\"\\nAll at once I saw the most  charminglittle people marching towards me.\"\\nThey did not reach higher than myknee;  they looked like human beings, but were better proportioned, andthey called  themselves elves.\"\\nTheir clothes were very delicate andfine, for they were made of  the leaves of flowers, trimmed with thewings of flies and gnats, which had not a bad  effect.\"\\nBy their manner,it appeared as if they were seeking for something.\"\\nI knew  not what,till at last one of them espied me and came towards me, and theforemost  pointed to my sausage skewer, and said, \\'There, that isjust what we want; see, it  is pointed at the top; is it notcapital?\\' and the longer he looked at my pilgrim\\'s  staff, the moredelighted he became.\"\\n\\'I will lend it to you,\\' said I, \\'but not tokeep.\\'  \"\\'Oh no, we won\\'t keep it!\\' they all cried; and then they seizedthe skewer, which  I gave up to them, and danced with it to the spotwhere the delicate moss grew, and  set it up in the middle of thegreen.\"\\nThey wanted a maypole, and the one they now had  seemed cutout on purpose for them.\"\\nThen they decorated it so beautifully that itwas  quite dazzling to look at.\"\\nLittle spiders spun golden threadsaround it, and then it  was hung with fluttering veils and flags sodelicately white that they glittered like  snow in the moonshine.\"\\nAfterthat they took colors from the butterfly\\'s wing, and  sprinkled themover the white drapery \"which gleamed as if covered with flowers  anddiamonds, so that I could not recognize my sausage skewer at all.\"\\nSucha maypole  had never been seen in all the world as this.\"\\nThen came agreat company of real elves.\"\\n Nothing could be finer than theirclothes, and they invited me to be present at the  feast; but I wasto keep at a certain distance, because I was too large for them.Then  commenced such music that it sounded like a thousand glass bells,and was so full and  strong that I thought it must be the song of theswans.\"\\nI fancied also that I heard  the voices of the cuckoo and theblack-bird, and it seemed at last as if the whole  forest sent forthglorious melodies- the voices of children, the tinkling of bells,and  the songs of the birds; and all this wonderful melody came fromthe elfin maypole.\"\\n My sausage peg was a complete peal of bells.\"\\nIcould scarcely believe that so much  could have been produced fromit, till I remembered into what hands it had fallen.\"\\n I was so muchaffected that I wept tears such as a little mouse can weep, but theywere  tears of joy.\"\\nThe night was far too short for me; there are nolong nights there in  summer, as we often have in this part of theworld.\"\\nWhen the morning dawned, and the  gentle breeze rippled theglassy mirror of the forest lake, all the delicate veils  and flagsfluttered away into thin air; the waving garlands of the spider\\'s web,the  hanging bridges and galleries, or whatever else they may becalled, vanished away as  if they had never been.\"\\nSix elves broughtme back my sausage skewer, and at the same  time asked me to make anyrequest, which they would grant if in their power; so I begged  them,if they could, to tell me how to make soup from a sausage skewer.\"\\n \"\\'How do we make it?\\' said the chief of the elves with a smile.\\'Why you have just  seen it; you scarcely knew your sausage skeweragain, I am sure.\\'  \"They think themselves very wise, thought I to myself.\"\\nThen I toldthem all about it,  and why I had travelled so far, and also whatpromise had been made at home to the  one who should discover themethod of preparing this soup.\"\\n\\'What use will it be,\\' I  asked, \\'to themouse-king or to our whole mighty kingdom that I have seen all  thesebeautiful things?\"\\nI cannot shake the sausage peg and say, Look, hereis the skewer,  and now the soup will come.\"\\nThat would only produce adish to be served when people  were keeping a fast.\\'  \"Then the elf dipped his finger into the cup of a violet, and saidto me, \\'Look here,  I will anoint your pilgrim\\'s staff, so that whenyou return to your own home and enter  the king\\'s castle, you have onlyto touch the king with your staff, and violets will  spring forth andcover the whole of it, even in the coldest winter time; so I think  Ihave given you really something to carry home, and a little morethan something.\\'\"  But before the little mouse explained what this something morewas, she stretched her  staff out to the king, and as it touched himthe most beautiful bunch of violets sprang  forth and filled theplace with perfume.\"\\nThe smell was so powerful that the  mouse-kingordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their tailsinto  the fire, that there might be a smell of burning, for the perfumeof the violets was  overpowering, and not the sort of scent thatevery one liked.\"\\n \"But what was the something more of which you spoke just now?\"\\nasked the mouse-king.\"\\n \"Why,\" answered the little mouse, \"I think it is what they call\\'effect;\\'\" and  thereupon she turned the staff round, and behold nota single flower was to be seen  upon it!\"\\nShe now only held the nakedskewer, and lifted it up as a conductor lifts  his baton at aconcert.\"\\n\"Violets, the elf told me,\" continued the mouse, \"are for  thesight, the smell, and the touch; so we have only now to produce theeffect of hearing  and tasting;\" and then, as the little mouse beattime with her staff, there came sounds  of music, not such music as washeard in the forest, at the elfin feast, but such as  is often heard inthe kitchen- the sounds of boiling and roasting.\"\\nIt came  quitesuddenly, like wind rushing through the chimneys, and seemed as ifevery pot and  kettle were boiling over.\"\\nThe fire-shovel clattered downon the brass fender; and then,  quite as suddenly, all was still,-nothing could be heard but the light, vapory song  of the tea-kettle,which was quite wonderful to hear, for no one could  rightlydistinguish whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or goingto stop.\"\\n And the little pot steamed, and the great pot simmered, butwithout any regard for  each; indeed there seemed no sense in thepots at all.\"\\nAnd as the little mouse waved  her baton still morewildly, the pots foamed and threw up bubbles, and boiled over;  whileagain the wind roared and whistled through the chimney, and at lastthere was  such a terrible hubbub, that the little mouse let herstick fall.\"\\n \"That is a strange sort of soup,\" said the mouse-king; \"shall wenot now hear about  the preparation?\"\\n  \"That is all,\" answered the little mouse, with a bow.\"\\n \"That all!\"\\n said the mouse-king; \"then we shall be glad to hearwhat information the  next may have to give us.\"\\n  WHAT THE SECOND MOUSE HAD TO TELL  \"I was born in the library, at a castle,\" said the second mouse.\"\\nVery few members  of our family ever had the good fortune to getinto the dining-room, much less the  store-room.\"\\nOn my journey, andhere to-day, are the only times I have ever seen a  kitchen.\"\\nWe wereoften obliged to suffer hunger in the library, but then we gained  agreat deal of knowledge.\"\\nThe rumor reached us of the royal prizeoffered to those  who should be able to make soup from a sausageskewer.\"\\nThen my old grandmother sought  out a manuscript which,however, she could not read, but had heard it read, and in  it waswritten, \\'Those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers.\\' Shethen asked  me if I was a poet.\"\\nI felt myself quite innocent of anysuch pretensions.\"\\nThen she  said I must go out and make myself apoet.\"\\nI asked again what I should be required  to do, for it seemedto me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of asausage  skewer.\"\\nMy grandmother had heard a great deal of reading inher day, and she told me  three principal qualifications werenecessary- understanding, imagination, and  feeling.\"\\n\\'If you can manageto acquire these three, you will be a poet, and the  sausage-skewersoup will be quite easy to you.\\'  \"So I went forth into the world, and turned my steps towards thewest, that I might  become a poet.\"\\nUnderstanding is the mostimportant matter in everything.\"\\nI knew that,  for the two otherqualifications are not thought much of; so I went first to seek  forunderstanding.\"\\nWhere was I to find it?\"\\n\\'Go to the ant and learnwisdom,\\' said the  great Jewish king.\"\\nI knew that from living in alibrary.\"\\nSo I went straight on till  I came to the first greatant-hill, and then I set myself to watch, that I might become  wise.The ants are a very respectable people, they are wisdom itself.\"\\nAllthey do is  like the working of a sum in arithmetic, which comes right.\\'To work and to lay eggs,\\'  say they, and to provide for posterity,is to live out your time properly;\\' and that  they truly do.\"\\nThey aredivided into the clean and the dirty ants, their rank is pointed  outby a number, and the ant-queen is number ONE; and her opinion is theonly correct  one on everything; she seems to have the whole wisdomof the world in her, which was  just the important matter I wished toacquire.\"\\nShe said a great deal which was no doubt  very clever; yetto me it sounded like nonsense.\"\\nShe said the ant-hill was the  loftiestthing in the world, and yet close to the mound stood a tall tree,which no  one could deny was loftier, much loftier, but no mentionwas made of the tree.\"\\nOne  evening an ant lost herself on this tree;she had crept up the stem, not nearly to  the top, but higher thanany ant had ever ventured; and when at last she returned home  she saidthat she had found something in her travels much higher than theant-hill.\"\\n The rest of the ants considered this an insult to thewhole community; so she was  condemned to wear a muzzle and to livein perpetual solitude.\"\\nA short time afterwards  another ant got onthe tree, and made the same journey and the same discovery, but  shespoke of it cautiously and indefinitely, and as she was one of thesuperior ants  and very much respected, they believed her, and when shedied they erected an eggshell  as a monument to her memory, for theycultivated a great respect for science.\"\\nI saw,\"  said the little mouse,\"that the ants were always running to and fro with her burdens  ontheir backs.\"\\nOnce I saw one of them drop her load; she gave herselfa great deal  of trouble in trying to raise it again, but she could notsucceed.\"\\nThen two others  came up and tried with all their strengthto help her, till they nearly dropped their  own burdens in doing so;then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help,  for everyone must think of himself first.\"\\nAnd the ant-queen remarked that theirconduct  that day showed that they possessed kind hearts and goodunderstanding.\"\\n\\'These two  qualities,\\' she continued, \\'place us ants inthe highest degree above all other  reasonable beings.\"\\nUnderstandingmust therefore be seen among us in the most prominent  manner, and mywisdom is greater than all.\\' And so saying she raised herself on hertwo  hind legs, that no one else might be mistaken for her.\"\\nI could nottherefore make an  error, so I ate her up.\"\\nWe are to go to the antsto learn wisdom, and I had got the  queen.\"\\n \"I now turned and went nearer to the lofty tree already mentioned,which was an oak.\"\\n It had a tall trunk with a wide-spreading top, andwas very old.\"\\nI knew that a living  being dwelt here, a dryad as she iscalled, who is born with the tree and dies with  it.\"\\nI had heard thisin the library, and here was just such a tree, and in it  anoak-maiden.\"\\nShe uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight ofme so near to  her; like many women, she was very much afraid ofmice.\"\\nAnd she had more real cause  for fear than they have, for I mighthave gnawed through the tree on which her life  depended.\"\\nI spoke toher in a kind and friendly manner, and begged her to take  courage.At last she took me up in her delicate hand, and then I told herwhat had brought  me out into the world, and she promised me thatperhaps on that very evening she should  be able to obtain for me oneof the two treasures for which I was seeking.\"\\nShe told  me thatPhantaesus was her very dear friend, that he was as beautiful as thegod of  love, that he remained often for many hours with her underthe leafy boughs of the  tree which then rustled and waved more thanever over them both.\"\\nHe called her his  dryad, she said, and the treehis tree; for the grand old oak, with its gnarled trunk,  was just tohis taste.\"\\nThe root, spreading deep into the earth, the top risinghigh  in the fresh air, knew the value of the drifted snow, the keenwind, and the warm  sunshine, as it ought to be known.\"\\n\\'Yes,\\' continuedthe dryad, \\'the birds sing up above  in the branches, and talk toeach other about the beautiful fields they have visited  in foreignlands; and on one of the withered boughs a stork has built hisnest,- it  is beautifully arranged, and besides it is pleasant tohear a little about the land  of the pyramids.\"\\nAll this pleasesPhantaesus, but it is not enough for him; I am obliged  to relate tohim of my life in the woods; and to go back to my childhood, when Iwas  little, and the tree so small and delicate that astinging-nettle could overshadow  it, and I have to tell everythingthat has happened since then till now that the tree  is so large andstrong.\"\\nSit you down now under the green bindwood and pay attention,when  Phantaesus comes I will find an opportunity to lay hold of hiswing and to pull out  one of the little feathers.\"\\nThat feather youshall have; a better was never given to  any poet, it will be quiteenough for you.\\'  \"And when Phantaesus came the feather was plucked, and,\" saidthe little mouse, \"I  seized and put it in water, and kept it theretill it was quite soft.\"\\nIt was very heavy  and indigestible, but Imanaged to nibble it up at last.\"\\nIt is not so easy to nibble  one\\'sself into a poet, there are so many things to get through.\"\\nNow,however, I had  two of them, understanding and imagination; and throughthese I knew that the third  was to be found in the library.\"\\nA greatman has said and written that there are novels  whose sole and only useappeared to be that they might relieve mankind of overflowing  tears- akind of sponge, in fact, for sucking up feelings and emotions.\"\\nIremembered  a few of these books, they had always appeared temptingto the appetite; they had been  much read, and were so greasy, thatthey must have absorbed no end of emotions in  themselves.\"\\nI retracedmy steps to the library, and literally devoured a whole novel,  thatis, properly speaking, the interior or soft part of it; the crust,or binding,  I left.\"\\nWhen I had digested not only this, but a second, Ifelt a stirring within me;  then I ate a small piece of a thirdromance, and felt myself a poet.\"\\nI said it to myself,  and toldothers the same.\"\\nI had head-ache and back-ache, and I cannot tell whataches  besides.\"\\nI thought over all the stories that may be said to beconnected with sausage  pegs, and all that has ever been writtenabout skewers, and sticks, and staves, and  splinters came to mythoughts; the ant-queen must have had a wonderfully  clearunderstanding.\"\\nI remembered the man who placed a white stick in hismouth by which  he could make himself and the stick invisible.\"\\nIthought of sticks as hobby-horses,  staves of music or rhyme, ofbreaking a stick over a man\\'s back, and heaven knows how  many morephrases of the same sort relating to sticks, staves, and skewers.All my  thoughts rein on skewers, sticks of wood, and staves; and asI am, at last, a poet,  and I have worked terribly hard to makemyself one, I can of course make poetry on  anything.\"\\nI shall thereforebe able to wait upon you every day in the week with a  poetical historyof a skewer.\"\\nAnd that is my soup.\"\\n  \"In that case,\" said the mouse-king, \"we will hear what thethird mouse has to say.\"\\n  \"Squeak, squeak,\" cried a little mouse at the kitchen door; it wasthe fourth, and  not the third, of the four who were contending for theprize, one whom the rest supposed  to be dead.\"\\nShe shot in like anarrow, and overturned the sausage peg that had been  covered withcrape.\"\\nShe had been running day and night.\"\\nShe had watched anopportunity  to get into a goods train, and had travelled by therailway; and yet she had arrived  almost too late.\"\\nShe pressed forward,looking very much ruffled.\"\\nShe had lost her  sausage skewer, but nother voice; for she began to speak at once as if they only waited  forher, and would hear her only, and as if nothing else in the worldwas of the least  consequence.\"\\nShe spoke out so clearly and plainly,and she had come in so suddenly,  that no one had time to stop her orto say a word while she was speaking.\"\\nAnd now let  us hear what shesaid.\"\\n WHAT THE FOURTH MOUSE, WHO SPOKE  BEFORE THE THIRD, HAD TO TELL  \"I started off at once to the largest town,\" said she, \"but thename of it has escaped  me.\"\\nI have a very bad memory for names.\"\\nI wascarried from the railway, with some  forfeited goods, to the jail,and on arriving I made my escape, and ran into the house  of theturnkey.\"\\nThe turnkey was speaking of his prisoners, especially ofone who had  uttered thoughtless words.\"\\nThese words had given rise toother words, and at length  they were written down and registered: \\'Thewhole affair is like making soup of sausage  skewers,\\' said he, \\'butthe soup may cost him his neck.\\'  \"Now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner,\" continuedthe little mouse, \"and  I watched my opportunity, and slipped intohis apartment, for there is a mouse-hole  to be found behind everyclosed door.\"\\nThe prisoner looked pale; he had a great beard  and large,sparkling eyes.\"\\nThere was a lamp burning, but the walls were soblack that  they only looked the blacker for it.\"\\nThe prisoner scratchedpictures and verses with  white chalk on the black walls, but I did notread the verses.\"\\nI think he found his  confinement wearisome, so that Iwas a welcome guest.\"\\nHe enticed me with bread-crumbs,  withwhistling, and with gentle words, and seemed so friendly towards me,that by  degrees I gained confidence in him, and we became friends;he divided his bread and  water with me, gave me cheese and sausage,and I really began to love him.\"\\nAltogether,  I must own that it was avery pleasant intimacy.\"\\nHe let me run about on his hand, and  on hisarm, and into his sleeve; and I even crept into his beard, and hecalled me his  little friend.\"\\nI forgot what I had come out into theworld for; forgot my sausage skewer  which I had laid in a crack in thefloor- it is lying there still.\"\\nI wished to stay  with him always whereI was, for I knew that if I went away the poor prisoner would  haveno one to be his friend, which is a sad thing.\"\\nI stayed, but he didnot.\"\\nHe spoke  to me so mournfully for the last time, gave me double asmuch bread and cheese as usual,  and kissed his hand to me.\"\\nThen hewent away, and never came back.\"\\nI know nothing more  of his history.\"\\n \"The jailer took possession of me now.\"\\nHe said something aboutsoup from a sausage  skewer, but I could not trust him.\"\\nHe took me inhis hand certainly, but it was to  place me in a cage like atread-mill.\"\\nOh how dreadful it was!\"\\nI had to run round and  roundwithout getting any farther in advance, and only to make everybodylaugh.\"\\nThe  jailer\\'s grand-daughter was a charming little thing.\"\\nShehad curly hair like the  brightest gold, merry eyes, and such a smilingmouth.\"\\n \"\\'You poor little mouse,\\' said she, one day as she peeped intomy cage, \\'I will set  you free.\\' She then drew forth the ironfastening, and I sprang out on the window-sill,  and from thence to theroof.\"\\nFree!\"\\nfree!\"\\nthat was all I could think of; not of the  objectof my journey.\"\\nIt grew dark, and as night was coming on I found alodging in  an old tower, where dwelt a watchman and an owl.\"\\nI had noconfidence in either of them,  least of all in the owl, which is like acat, and has a great failing, for she eats  mice.\"\\nOne may however bemistaken sometimes; and so was I, for this was a respectable  andwell-educated old owl, who knew more than the watchman, and even asmuch as I did  myself.\"\\nThe young owls made a great fuss abouteverything, but the only rough words  she would say to them were,\\'You had better go and make some soup from sausage skewers.\\'  She wasvery indulgent and loving to her children.\"\\nHer conduct gave me suchconfidence  in her, that from the crack where I sat I called out\\'squeak.\\' This confidence of mine  pleased her so much that she assuredme she would take me under her own protection,  and that not a creatureshould do me harm.\"\\nThe fact was, she wickedly meant to keep  me inreserve for her own eating in winter, when food would be scarce.\"\\nYetshe was a  very clever lady-owl; she explained to me that thewatchman could only hoot with the  horn that hung loose at his side;and then she said he is so terribly proud of it,  that he imagineshimself an owl in the tower;- wants to do great things, but  onlysucceeds in small; all soup on a sausage skewer.\"\\nThen I begged the owlto give  me the recipe for this soup.\"\\n\\'Soup from a sausage skewer,\\'said she, \\'is only a proverb  amongst mankind, and may be understood inmany ways.\"\\nEach believes his own way the  best, and after all, theproverb signifies nothing.\\' \\'Nothing!\\' I exclaimed.\"\\nI was  quitestruck.\"\\nTruth is not always agreeable, but truth is above everythingelse, as  the old owl said.\"\\nI thought over all this, and saw quiteplainly that if truth was  really so far above everything else, it mustbe much more valuable than soup from a  sausage skewer.\"\\nSo I hastenedto get away, that I might be home in time, and bring  what washighest and best, and above everything- namely, the truth.\"\\nThe miceare an  enlightened people, and the mouse-king is above them all.\"\\nHe istherefore capable of  making me queen for the sake of truth.\"\\n  \"Your truth is a falsehood,\" said the mouse who had not yetspoken; \"I can prepare  the soup, and I mean to do so.\"\\n  HOW IT WAS PREPARED  \"I did not travel,\" said the third mouse; \"I stayed in thiscountry: that was the right  way.\"\\nOne gains nothing by travelling-everything can be acquired here quite as easily;  so I stayed athome.\"\\nI have not obtained what I know from supernatural beings.\"\\nI  haveneither swallowed it, nor learnt it from conversing with owls.\"\\nIhave got it all  from my reflections and thoughts.\"\\nWill you now set thekettle on the fire- so?\"\\nNow  pour the water in- quite full- up to thebrim; place it on the fire; make up a good  blaze; keep it burning,that the water may boil; it must boil over and over.\"\\nThere,  now Ithrow in the skewer.\"\\nWill the mouse-king be pleased now to dip histail into the  boiling water, and stir it round with the tail.\"\\nThelonger the king stirs it, the  stronger the soup will become.\"\\nNothingmore is necessary, only to stir it.\"\\n  \"Can no one else do this?\"\\n asked the king.\"\\n \"No,\" said the mouse; \"only in the tail of the mouse-king isthis power contained.\"\\n  And the water boiled and bubbled, as the mouse-king stood closebeside the kettle.\"\\n It seemed rather a dangerous performance; but heturned round, and put out his tail,  as mice do in a dairy, when theywish to skim the cream from a pan of milk with their  tails andafterwards lick it off.\"\\nBut the mous  1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE ANGEL  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"WHENEVER a good child dies, an angel of God comes down fromheaven, takes the dead  child in his arms, spreads out his greatwhite wings, and flies with him over all the  places which the childhad loved during his life.\"\\nThen he gathers a large handful of  flowers,which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom more brightlyin  heaven than they do on earth.\"\\nAnd the Almighty presses theflowers to His heart, but  He kisses the flower that pleases Himbest, and it receives a voice, and is able to  join the song of thechorus of bliss.\"\\n  These words were spoken by an angel of God, as he carried a deadchild up to heaven,  and the child listened as if in a dream.\"\\nThen theypassed over well-known spots, where  the little one had often played,and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers.\"\\n \"Which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplantedthere?\"\\n asked the  angel.\"\\n Close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some wickedhand had broken the  stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung fadedand withered on the trailing branches.\"\\n \"Poor rose-bush!\"\\n said the child, \"let us take it with us toheaven, that it may bloom  above in God\\'s garden.\"\\n  The angel took up the rose-bush; then he kissed the child, and thelittle one half  opened his eyes.\"\\nThe angel gathered also somebeautiful flowers, as well as a few humble  buttercups andheart\\'s-ease.\"\\n \"Now we have flowers enough,\" said the child; but the angel onlynodded, he did not  fly upward to heaven.\"\\n It was night, and quite still in the great town.\"\\nHere theyremained, and the angel  hovered over a small, narrow street, inwhich lay a large heap of straw, ashes, and  sweepings from thehouses of people who had removed.\"\\nThere lay fragments of  plates,pieces of plaster, rags, old hats, and other rubbish not pleasant tosee.\"\\nAmidst  all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces of abroken flower-pot, and to  a lump of earth which had fallen out ofit.\"\\nThe earth had been kept from falling to  pieces by the roots of awithered field-flower, which had been thrown amongst the  rubbish.\"\\n \"We will take this with us,\" said the angel, \"I will tell youwhy as we fly along.\"\\n  And as they flew the angel related the history.\"\\n \"Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor sick boy;he had been afflicted  from his childhood, and even in his best days hecould just manage to walk up and down  the room on crutches once ortwice, but no more.\"\\nDuring some days in summer, the  sunbeams would lieon the floor of the cellar for about half an hour.\"\\nIn this spot  thepoor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine, andwatching the red blood  through his delicate fingers as he held thembefore his face.\"\\nThen he would say he  had been out, yet he knewnothing of the green forest in its spring verdure, till a  neighbor\\'sson brought him a green bough from a beech-tree.\"\\nThis he would placeover  his head, and fancy that he was in the beech-wood while the sunshone, and the birds  carolled gayly.\"\\nOne spring day the neighbor\\'s boybrought him some field-flowers, and  among them was one to which theroot still adhered.\"\\nThis he carefully planted in a  flower-pot, andplaced in a window-seat near his bed.\"\\nAnd the flower had beenplanted  by a fortunate hand, for it grew, put forth fresh shoots,and blossomed every year.\"\\n It became a splendid flower-garden to thesick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.\"\\n He watered it, andcherished it, and took care it should have the benefit of  everysunbeam that found its way into the cellar, from the earliestmorning ray to the  evening sunset.\"\\nThe flower entwined itself evenin his dreams- for him it bloomed,  for him spread its perfume.\"\\nAndit gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned,  even in death,when the Lord called him.\"\\nHe has been one year with God.\"\\nDuring thattime  the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten,till at length cast out  among the sweepings into the street, on theday of the lodgers\\' removal.\"\\nAnd this poor  flower, withered andfaded as it is, we have added to our nosegay, because it gave  morereal joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen.\"\\n  \"But how do you know all this?\"\\n asked the child whom the angel wascarrying to heaven.\"\\n \"I know it,\" said the angel, \"because I myself was the poor sickboy who walked upon  crutches, and I know my own flower well.\"\\n  Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorioushappy face of the angel,  and at the same moment they foundthemselves in that heavenly home where all is  happiness and joy.\"\\nAndGod pressed the dead child to His heart, and wings were given  him sothat he could fly with the angel, hand in hand.\"\\nThen the Almightypressed all  the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the witheredfield-flower, and it received  a voice.\"\\nThen it joined in the song ofthe angels, who surrounded the throne, some  near, and others in adistant circle, but all equally happy.\"\\nThey all joined in the  chorusof praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and thepoor  field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap ofrubbish in a narrow,  dark street.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BEETLE WHO WENT ON HIS TRAVELS  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once an Emperor who had a horse shod with gold.\"\\nHe had agolden shoe on each  foot, and why was this?\"\\nHe was a beautifulcreature, with slender legs, bright,  intelligent eyes, and a mane thathung down over his neck like a veil.\"\\nHe had carried  his master throughfire and smoke in the battle-field, with the bullets whistling  roundhim; he had kicked and bitten, and taken part in the fight, when theenemy advanced;  and, with his master on his back, he had dashed overthe fallen foe, and saved the  golden crown and the Emperor\\'s life,which was of more value than the brightest gold.\"\\n This is the reason ofthe Emperor\\'s horse wearing golden shoes.\"\\n A beetle came creeping forth from the stable, where the farrierhad been shoeing the  horse.\"\\n\"Great ones, first, of course,\" said he,\"and then the little ones; but size  is not always a proof ofgreatness.\"\\n He stretched out his thin leg as he spoke.\"\\n \"And pray what do you want?\"\\n asked the farrier.\"\\n \"Golden shoes,\" replied the beetle.\"\\n \"Why, you must be out of your senses,\" cried the farrier.\"\\nGolden shoes for you,  indeed!\"\\n  \"Yes, certainly; golden shoes,\" replied the beetle.\"\\n\"Am I not justas good as that  great creature yonder, who is waited upon and brushed,and has food and drink placed  before him?\"\\nAnd don\\'t I belong to theroyal stables?\"\\n  \"But why does the horse have golden shoes?\"\\n asked the farrier; \"ofcourse you  understand the reason?\"\\n  \"Understand!\"\\nWell, I understand that it is a personal slight tome,\" cried the beetle.\"\\n \"It is done to annoy me, so I intend to goout into the world and seek my fortune.\"\\n  \"Go along with you,\" said the farrier.\"\\n \"You\\'re a rude fellow,\" cried the beetle, as he walked out ofthe stable; and then  he flew for a short distance, till he foundhimself in a beautiful flower-garden, all  fragrant with roses andlavender.\"\\nThe lady-birds, with red and black shells on their  backs,and delicate wings, were flying about, and one of them said, \"Is itnot sweet  and lovely here?\"\\nOh, how beautiful everything is.\"\\n  \"I am accustomed to better things,\" said the beetle.\"\\n\"Do youcall this beautiful?\"\\nWhy,  there is not even a dung-heap.\"\\n Then he wenton, and under the shadow of a large haystack  he found a caterpillarcrawling along.\"\\n\"How beautiful this world is!\"\\n said the  caterpillar.\"\\nThe sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it.\"\\nAnd soon I shall go to sleep,and  die as they call it, but I shall wake up with beautiful wings tofly with, like a  butterfly.\"\\n  \"How conceited you are!\"\\n exclaimed the beetle.\"\\n\"Fly about as abutterfly, indeed!\"\\nwhat  of that.\"\\nI have come out of the Emperor\\'sstable, and no one there, not even the  Emperor\\'s horse, who, infact, wears my cast-off golden shoes, has any idea of  flying,excepting myself.\"\\nTo have wings and fly!\"\\nwhy, I can do thatalready;\" and so  saying, he spread his wings and flew away.\"\\n\"I don\\'twant to be disgusted,\" he said  to himself, \"and yet I can\\'t helpit.\"\\n Soon after, he fell down upon an extensive lawn,  and for a timepretended to sleep, but at last fell asleep in earnest.\"\\nSuddenly aheavy  shower of rain came falling from the clouds.\"\\nThe beetle wokeup with the noise and  would have been glad to creep into the earth forshelter, but he could not.\"\\nHe was  tumbled over and over with the rain,sometimes swimming on his stomach and sometimes  on his back; and asfor flying, that was out of the question.\"\\nHe began to doubt whether  heshould escape with his life, so he remained, quietly lying where hewas.\"\\nAfter a  while the weather cleared up a little, and the beetle wasable to rub the water from  his eyes, and look about him.\"\\nHe sawsomething gleaming, and he managed to make his  way up to it.\"\\nIt waslinen which had been laid to bleach on the grass.\"\\nHe crept into  a foldof the damp linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place tolie in as  the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so heremained lying there for a whole  day and night, and the rain kept onall the time.\"\\nTowards morning he crept out of his  hiding-place,feeling in a very bad temper with the climate.\"\\nTwo frogs weresitting  on the linen, and their bright eyes actually glistened withpleasure.\"\\n \"Wonderful weather this,\" cried one of them, \"and so refreshing.This linen holds the  water together so beautifully, that my hindlegs quiver as if I were going to swim.\"\\n  \"I should like to know,\" said another, \"If the swallow who fliesso far in her many  journeys to foreign lands, ever met with a betterclimate than this.\"\\nWhat delicious  moisture!\"\\nIt is as pleasant as lyingin a wet ditch.\"\\nI am sure any one who does not  enjoy this has nolove for his fatherland.\"\\n  \"Have you ever been in the Emperor\\'s stable?\"\\n asked the beetle.\"\\nThere the moisture  is warm and refreshing; that\\'s the climate for me,but I could not take it with me  on my travels.\"\\nIs there not even adunghill here in this garden, where a person of  rank, like myself,could take up his abode and feel at home?\"\\n But the frogs either  didnot or would not understand him.\"\\n \"I never ask a question twice,\" said the beetle, after he hadasked this one three  times, and received no answer.\"\\nThen he went ona little farther and stumbled against  a piece of broken crockery-ware,which certainly ought not to have been lying there.\"\\n But as it wasthere, it formed a good shelter against wind and weather to  severalfamilies of earwigs who dwelt in it.\"\\nTheir requirements were not many,they  were very sociable, and full of affection for their children,so much so that each  mother considered her own child the mostbeautiful and clever of them all.\"\\n \"Our dear son has engaged himself,\" said one mother, \"dearinnocent boy; his greatest  ambition is that he may one day creepinto a clergyman\\'s ear.\"\\nThat is a very artless  and loveable wish;and being engaged will keep him steady.\"\\nWhat happiness for a  mother!\"\\n  \"Our son,\" said another, \"had scarcely crept out of the egg,when he was off on his  travels.\"\\nHe is all life and spirits, I expecthe will wear out his horns with running.\"\\n How charming this is for amother, is it not Mr.\"\\nBeetle?\"\\n for she knew the stranger  by hishorny coat.\"\\n \"You are both quite right,\" said he; so they begged him to walkin, that is to come  as far as he could under the broken piece ofearthenware.\"\\n \"Now you shall also see my little earwigs,\" said a third and afourth mother, \"they  are lovely little things, and highly amusing.They are never ill-behaved, except when  they are uncomfortable intheir inside, which unfortunately often happens at their  age.\"\\n  Thus each mother spoke of her baby, and their babies talkedafter their own fashion,  and made use of the little nippers theyhave in their tails to nip the beard of the  beetle.\"\\n \"They are always busy about something, the little rogues,\" saidthe mother, beaming  with maternal pride; but the beetle felt it abore, and he therefore inquired the way  to the nearest dung-heap.\"\\n \"That is quite out in the great world, on the other side of theditch,\" answered an  earwig, \"I hope none of my children will ever goso far, it would be the death of me.\"\\n  \"But I shall try to get so far,\" said the beetle, and he walkedoff without taking  any formal leave, which is considered a politething to do.\"\\n When he arrived at the ditch, he met several friends, all thembeetles; \"We live here,\"  they said, \"and we are very comfortable.May we ask you to step down into this rich  mud, you must be fatiguedafter your journey.\"\\n  \"Certainly,\" said the beetle, \"I shall be most happy; I havebeen exposed to the rain,  and have had to lie upon linen, andcleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me;  I have also painsin one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece ofbroken  crockery.\"\\nIt is really quite refreshing to be with one\\'s ownkindred again.\"\\n  \"Perhaps you came from a dung-heap,\" observed the oldest of them.\"\\n \"No, indeed, I came from a much grander place,\" replied thebeetle; \"I came from the  emperor\\'s stable, where I was born, withgolden shoes on my feet.\"\\nI am travelling on  a secret embassy, butyou must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my secret.\"\\n  Then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud, where sat threeyoung-lady beetles,  who tittered, because they did not know what tosay.\"\\n \"None of them are engaged yet,\" said their mother, and thebeetle maidens tittered  again, this time quite in confusion.\"\\n \"I have never seen greater beauties, even in the royal stables,\"exclaimed the beetle,  who was now resting himself.\"\\n \"Don\\'t spoil my girls,\" said the mother; \"and don\\'t talk tothem, pray, unless you  have serious intentions.\"\\n  But of course the beetle\\'s intentions were serious, and after awhile our friend was  engaged.\"\\nThe mother gave them her blessing, andall the other beetles cried \"hurrah.\"\\n  Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage, for there wasno reason to delay.\"\\n The following day passed very pleasantly, andthe next was tolerably comfortable; but  on the third it becamenecessary for him to think of getting food for his wife, and,  perhaps,for children.\"\\n \"I have allowed myself to be taken in,\" said our beetle tohimself, \"and now there\\'s  nothing to be done but to take them in, inreturn.\"\\n  No sooner said than done.\"\\nAway he went, and stayed away all dayand all night, and  his wife remained behind a forsaken widow.\"\\n \"Oh,\" said the other beetles, \"this fellow that we have receivedinto our family is  nothing but a complete vagabond.\"\\nHe has gone awayand left his wife a burden upon our  hands.\"\\n  \"Well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my otherdaughters,\" said the  mother.\"\\n\"Fie on the villain that forsook her!\"\\n  In the mean time the beetle, who had sailed across the ditch ona cabbage leaf, had  been journeying on the other side.\"\\nIn themorning two persons came up to the ditch.\"\\n When they saw him theytook him up and turned him over and over, looking very learned  all thetime, especially one, who was a boy.\"\\n\"Allah sees the black beetle inthe black  stone, and the black rock.\"\\nIs not that written in theKoran?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n Then he translated the beetle\\'s name into Latin, and said agreat deal upon the  creature\\'s nature and history.\"\\nThe secondperson, who was older and a scholar, proposed  to carry the beetlehome, as they wanted just such good specimens as this.\"\\nOur  beetleconsidered this speech a great insult, so he flew suddenly out ofthe speaker\\'s  hand.\"\\nHis wings were dry now, so they carried him to agreat distance, till at last  he reached a hothouse, where a sash ofthe glass roof was partly open, so he quietly  slipped in and buriedhimself in the warm earth.\"\\n\"It is very comfortable here,\" he  said tohimself, and soon after fell asleep.\"\\nThen he dreamed that theemperor\\'s horse  was dying, and had left him his golden shoes, and alsopromised that he should have  two more.\"\\nAll this was very delightful,and when the beetle woke up he crept forth  and looked around him.\"\\nWhata splendid place the hothouse was!\"\\nAt the back, large  palm-treeswere growing; and the sunlight made the leaves- look quite glossy;  andbeneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green, and of flowers redlike flame,  yellow as amber, or white as new-fallen snow!\"\\n\"What awonderful quantity of plants,\"  cried the beetle; \"how good they willtaste when they are decayed!\"\\nThis is a capital  store-room.\"\\nTheremust certainly be some relations of mine living here; I will justsee  if I can find any one with whom I can associate.\"\\nI\\'m proud,certainly; but I\\'m also  proud of being so.\"\\nThen he prowled about inthe earth, and thought what a pleasant  dream that was about thedying horse, and the golden shoes he had inherited.\"\\nSuddenly  a handseized the beetle, and squeezed him, and turned him round and round.The  gardener\\'s little son and his playfellow had come into thehothouse, and, seeing the  beetle, wanted to have some fun with him.First, he was wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and  put into a warm trousers\\'pocket.\"\\nHe twisted and turned about with all his might, but  he got agood squeeze from the boy\\'s hand, as a hint for him to keep quiet.Then the  boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of thegarden.\"\\nHere the beetle  was put into an old broken wooden shoe, inwhich a little stick had been fastened  upright for a mast, and to thismast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted.\"\\n Now he was asailor, and had to sail away.\"\\nThe lake was not very large, but tothe beetle  it seemed an ocean, and he was so astonished at its sizethat he fell over on his back,  and kicked out his legs.\"\\nThen thelittle ship sailed away; sometimes the current of  the water seized it,but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turnedup  his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land.But at last, just  as it went merrily out again, the two boys werecalled, and so angrily, that they  hastened to obey, and ran away asfast as they could from the pond, so that the little  ship was leftto its fate.\"\\nIt was carried away farther and farther from the shore,till  it reached the open sea.\"\\nThis was a terrible prospect for thebeetle, for he could  not escape in consequence of being bound to themast.\"\\nThen a fly came and paid him  a visit.\"\\n\"What beautifulweather,\" said the fly; \"I shall rest here and sun myself.\"\\n You musthave a pleasant time of it.\"\\n  \"You speak without knowing the facts,\" replied the beetle;\"don\\'t you see that I am  a prisoner?\"\\n  \"Ah, but I\\'m not a prisoner,\" remarked the fly, and away he flew.\"\\n \"Well, now I know the world,\" said the beetle to himself; \"it\\'s anabominable world;  I\\'m the only respectable person in it.\"\\nFirst, theyrefuse me my golden shoes; then  I have to lie on damp linen, and tostand in a draught; and to crown all, they fasten  a wife upon me.Then, when I have made a step forward in the world, and found out  acomfortable position, just as I could wish it to be, one of thesehuman boys comes  and ties me up, and leaves me to the mercy of thewild waves, while the emperor\\'s  favorite horse goes prancing aboutproudly on his golden shoes.\"\\nThis vexes me more  than anything.\"\\nButit is useless to look for sympathy in this world.\"\\nMy career has  beenvery interesting, but what\\'s the use of that if nobody knowsanything about it?\"\\n The world does not deserve to be made acquaintedwith my adventures, for it ought to  have given me golden shoes whenthe emperor\\'s horse was shod, and I stretched out my  feet to beshod, too.\"\\nIf I had received golden shoes I should have been anornament  to the stable; now I am lost to the stable and to theworld.\"\\nIt is all over with me.\"\\n  But all was not yet over.\"\\nA boat, in which were a few young girls,came rowing up.\"\\n \"Look, yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along,\"said one of the younger girls.\"\\n \"And there\\'s a poor little creature bound fast in it,\" saidanother.\"\\n The boat now came close to our beetle\\'s ship, and the younggirls fished it out of  the water.\"\\nOne of them drew a small pair ofscissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted  without hurting thebeetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the  grass.\"\\nThere,\" she said, \"creep away, or fly, if thou canst.\"\\nIt is asplendid thing  to have thy liberty.\"\\n Away flew the beetle, straightthrough the open window of a large  building; there he sank down, tiredand exhausted, exactly on the mane of the emperor\\'s  favorite horse,who was standing in his stable; and the beetle found himself at  homeagain.\"\\nFor some time he clung to the mane, that he might recoverhimself.\"\\n\"Well,\"  he said, \"here I am, seated on the emperor\\'s favoritehorse,- sitting upon him as if  I were the emperor himself.\"\\nBut whatwas it the farrier asked me?\"\\nAh, I remember now,-  that\\'s a goodthought,- he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse.The  answer is quite clear to me, now.\"\\nThey were given to the horseon my account.\"\\n And  this reflection put the beetle into a good temper.The sun\\'s rays also came streaming  into the stable, and shone uponhim, and made the place lively and bright.\"\\n\"Travelling  expands themind very much,\" said the beetle.\"\\n\"The world is not so bad afterall, if  you know how to take things as they come.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BELL  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the narrow streets of a large town people often heard in theevening, when the sun  was setting, and his last rays gave a goldentint to the chimney-pots, a strange noise  which resembled the sound ofa church bell; it only lasted an instant, for it was lost  in thecontinual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose from thetown.\"\\n\"The evening  bell is ringing,\" people used to say; \"the sun issetting!\"\\n Those who walked outside  the town, where the houses wereless crowded and interspersed by gardens and little  fields, saw theevening sky much better, and heard the sound of the bell much  moreclearly.\"\\nIt seemed as though the sound came from a church, deep in thecalm,  fragrant wood, and thither people looked with devout feelings.\"\\n A considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, \"I reallywonder if there is a  church out in the wood.\"\\nThe bell has indeed astrange sweet sound!\"\\nShall we go there  and see what the cause of itis?\"\\n The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed  to themextraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willowtrees on the  border of the wood they sat down, looked up into thegreat branches and thought they  were now really in the wood.\"\\nAconfectioner from the town also came out and put up  a stall there;then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall, whichwas  covered with pitch to protect it from the rain, but the clapperwas wanting.\"\\n When people came home they used to say that it had been veryromantic, and that really  means something else than merely taking tea.Three persons declared that they had gone  as far as the end of thewood; they had always heard the strange sound, but there it  seemedto them as if it came from the town.\"\\nOne of them wrote verses aboutthe bell,  and said that it was like the voice of a mother speakingto an intelligent and beloved  child; no tune, he said, was sweeterthan the sound of the bell.\"\\n The emperor of the country heard of it, and declared that he whowould really find  out where the sound came from should receive thetitle of \"Bellringer to the World,\"  even if there was no bell at all.\"\\n Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendidberth; but only one of  them came back with some sort of explanation.None of them had gone far enough, nor  had he, and yet he said that thesound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow  tree.\"\\nIt was awisdom owl, which continually knocked its head against the tree, buthe  was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollowtrunk of the tree was  the cause of the noise.\"\\n He was appointed \"Bellringer to the World,\" and wrote every year ashort dissertation  on the owl, but by this means people did not becomeany wiser than they had been before.\"\\n It was just confirmation-day.\"\\nThe clergyman had delivered abeautiful and touching  sermon, the candidates were deeply moved by it;it was indeed a very important day  for them; they were all at oncetransformed from mere children to grown-up people;  the childish soulwas to fly over, as it were, into a more reasonable being.\"\\n The sun shone most brightly; and the sound of the great unknownbell was heard more  distinctly than ever.\"\\nThey had a mind to gothither, all except three.\"\\nOne of them  wished to go home and try onher ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were  the cause of herbeing confirmed this time, otherwise she would not have been allowedto  go.\"\\nThe second, a poor boy, had borrowed a coat and a pair of bootsfrom the son of  his landlord to be confirmed in, and he had toreturn them at a certain time.\"\\nThe third  said that he never wentinto strange places if his parents were not with him; he had  alwaysbeen a good child, and wished to remain so, even after beingconfirmed, and they  ought not to tease him for this; they, however,did it all the same.\"\\nThese three,  therefore did not go; the otherswent on.\"\\nThe sun was shining, the birds were singing,  and theconfirmed children sang too, holding each other by the hand, forthey had no  position yet, and they were all equal in the eyes ofGod.\"\\nTwo of the smallest soon  became tired and returned to the town;two little girls sat down and made garlands  of flowers, they,therefore, did not go on.\"\\nWhen the others arrived at the willow  trees,where the confectioner had put up his stall, they said: \"Now we areout here;  the bell does not in reality exist- it is only somethingthat people imagine!\"\\n  Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully andsolemnly from the  wood that four or five made up their minds to gostill further on.\"\\nThe wood was very  thickly grown.\"\\nIt was difficult toadvance: wood lilies and anemones grew almost too  high; floweringconvolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree totree;  while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played.That was very beautiful!\"\\n But the way was unfit for the girls; theywould have torn their dresses.\"\\nLarge rocks,  covered with moss ofvarious hues, were lying about; the fresh spring water rippled  forthwith a peculiar sound.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think that can be the bell,\" saidone of the  confirmed children, and then he lay down and listened.\"\\nWe must try to find out if  it is!\"\\n And there he remained, and let theothers walk on.\"\\n They came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches; alarge crab-apple tree  spread its branches over it, as if it intendedto pour all its fruit on the roof, upon  which roses were blooming; thelong boughs covered the gable, where a little bell was  hanging.\"\\nWasthis the one they had heard?\"\\nAll agreed that it must be so, except onewho  said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard atsuch a distance, and that  it had quite a different sound to that whichhad so touched men\\'s hearts.\"\\n He who spoke was a king\\'s son, and therefore the others saidthat such a one always  wishes to be cleverer than other people.\"\\n Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitudeof the wood produced  a feeling of reverence in his breast; but stillhe heard the little bell about which  the others rejoiced, andsometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could  hear thesounds from the confectioner\\'s stall, where the others were singing attea.\"\\n But the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger; soon itseemed to him as if an  organ played an accompaniment- the sound camefrom the left, from the side where the  heart is.\"\\nNow something rustledamong the bushes, and a little boy stood before the  king\\'s son, inwooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach  tohis wrists.\"\\nThey knew each other: the boy was the one who had not beenable to go  with them because he had to take the coat and boots back tohis landlord\\'s son.\"\\nThat  he had done, and had started again in hiswooden shoes and old clothes, for the sound  of the bell was tooenticing- he felt he must go on.\"\\n \"We might go together,\" said the king\\'s son.\"\\nBut the poor boy withthe wooden shoes  was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short sleevesof his jacket, and said that he was  afraid he could not walk sofast; besides, he was of opinion that the bell ought to  be sought atthe right, for there was all that was grand and magnificent.\"\\n \"Then we shall not meet,\" said the king\\'s son, nodding to the poorboy, who went into  the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns torehis shabby clothes and scratched  his hands, face, and feet untilthey bled.\"\\nThe king\\'s son also received several good  scratches, butthe sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will nowfollow,  for he was a quick fellow.\"\\n\"I will and must find the bell,\" hesaid, \"if I have to  go to the end of the world.\"\\n  Ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth.\"\\nShall we beat him?\"\\n  they said.\"\\n\"Shall we thrash him?\"\\nHe is a king\\'sson!\"\\n  But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, wherethe most wonderful  flowers were growing; there were standing whitestar lilies with blood-red stamens,  sky-blue tulips shining when thewind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples like  large glitteringsoap bubbles: only think how resplendent these trees were in  thesunshine!\"\\nAll around were beautiful green meadows, where hart and hindplayed in  the grass.\"\\nThere grew magnificent oaks and beech-trees;and if the bark was split of  any of them, long blades of grass grewout of the clefts; there were also large smooth  lakes in the wood,on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings.\"\\n Theking\\'s son often stood still and listened; sometimes he thought thatthe sound of  the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes,but soon he found that this  was a mistake, and that the bell wasringing still farther in the wood.\"\\nThen the sun  set, the clouds wereas red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on  hisknees, sang an evening hymn and said: \"I shall never find what I amlooking for!\"\\n Now the sun is setting, and the night, the dark night, isapproaching.\"\\nYet I may perhaps  see the round sun once more before hedisappears beneath the horizon.\"\\nI will climb  up these rocks, theyare as high as the highest trees!\"\\n And then, taking hold of  thecreepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, wherewater-snakes were  wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked athim: he reached the top before the sun,  seen from such a height, hadquite set.\"\\n\"Oh, what a splendour!\"\\n The sea, the great  majestic sea,which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched outbefore  him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar andthere where sea and heaven  met- all melted together in the mostglowing colours; the wood was singing, and his  heart too.\"\\nThe whole ofnature was one large holy church, in which the trees and  hoveringclouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvetcarpet, and  heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flamecolour vanished as soon as the  sun disappeared, but millions ofstars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and  the king\\'s sonstretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towardsthe  wood.\"\\nThen suddenly the poor boy with the short-sleeved jacket andthe wooden shoes  appeared; he had arrived just as quickly on theroad he had chosen.\"\\nAnd they ran towards  each other and took oneanother\\'s hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy,  andabove them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surroundedthem, singing  hallelujahs and rejoicing.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BELL-DEEP  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"DING-DONG!\"\\nding-dong!\"\\n It sounds up from the \"bell-deep\" in theOdense-Au.\"\\nEvery  child in the old town of Odense, on the island ofFunen, knows the Au, which washes  the gardens round about the town,and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam  to thewater-mill.\"\\nIn the Au grow the yellow water-lilies and brownfeathery reeds;  the dark velvety flag grows there, high and thick; oldand decayed willows, slanting  and tottering, hang far out over thestream beside the monk\\'s meadow and by the  bleaching ground; butopposite there are gardens upon gardens, each different from  the rest,some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls\\' pleasuregrounds,  often displaying cabbage and other kitchen plants; and hereand there the gardens  cannot be seen at all, for the great elder treesthat spread themselves out by the  bank, and hang far out over thestreaming waters, which are deeper here and there than  an oar canfathom.\"\\nOpposite the old nunnery is the deepest place, which is calledthe  \"bell-deep,\" and there dwells the old water spirit, the \"Au-mann.\"\\nThis spirit sleeps  through the day while the sun shines down uponthe water; but in starry and moonlit  nights he shows himself.\"\\nHe isvery old.\"\\nGrandmother says that she has heard her own  grandmother tellof him; he is said to lead a solitary life, and to have nobody withwhom  he can converse save the great old church Bell.\"\\nOnce the Bellhung in the church tower;  but now there is no trace left of thetower or of the church, which was called St.\"\\n Alban\\'s.\"\\n \"Ding-dong!\"\\nding-dong!\"\\n sounded the Bell, when the tower stillstood there; and one  evening, while the sun was setting, and theBell was swinging away bravely, it broke  loose and came flying downthrough the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy  beam.\"\\n \"Ding-dong!\"\\nding-dong!\"\\nNow I\\'ll retire to rest!\"\\n sang the Bell,and flew down into  the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and that is whythe place is called the \"bell-deep.\"\\n  But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep.\"\\nDown in the Au-mann\\'shaunt it sounds and  rings, so that the tones sometimes pierce upwardthrough the waters; and many people  maintain that its strains forebodethe death of some one; but that is not true, for  the Bell is onlytalking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer alone.\"\\n And what is the Bell telling?\"\\nIt is old, very old, as we havealready observed; it  was there long before grandmother\\'s grandmotherwas born; and yet it is but a child  in comparison with the Au-mann,who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with  his hose ofeel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons, anda  wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard; but he looksvery pretty for all  that.\"\\n What the Bell tells?\"\\nTo repeat it all would require years anddays; for year by year  it is telling the old stories, sometimesshort ones, sometimes long ones, according  to its whim; it tells ofold times, of the dark hard times, thus:  \"In the church of St.\"\\nAlban, the monk had mounted up into thetower.\"\\nHe was young and  handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly.\"\\nHelooked through the loophole out upon the  Odense-Au, when the bed ofthe water was yet broad, and the monks\\' meadow was still  a lake.\"\\nHelooked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the nuns\\' hillopposite,  where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth fromthe nun\\'s cell.\"\\nHe had known  the nun right well, and he thought ofher, and his heart beat quicker as he thought.\"\\n Ding-dong!\"\\nding-dong!\"\\n  Yes, this was the story the Bell told.\"\\n \"Into the tower came also the dapper man-servant of the bishop;and when I, the Bell,  who am made of metal, rang hard and loud, andswung to and fro, I might have beaten  out his brains.\"\\nHe sat downclose under me, and played with two little sticks as if  they hadbeen a stringed instrument; and he sang to it.\"\\n\\'Now I may sing itout aloud,  though at other times I may not whisper it.\"\\nI may sing ofeverything that is kept  concealed behind lock and bars.\"\\nYonder it iscold and wet.\"\\nThe rats are eating her  up alive!\"\\nNobody knows of it!Nobody hears of it!\"\\nNot even now, for the bell is ringing  andsinging its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!\\'  \"There was a King in those days.\"\\nThey called him Canute.\"\\nHebowed himself before bishop  and monk; but when he offended the freepeasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they  seized their weaponsand put him to flight like a wild beast.\"\\nHe sought shelter in  thechurch, and shut gate and door behind him.\"\\nThe violent band surroundedthe church;  I heard tell of it.\"\\nThe crows, ravens and magpiesstarted up in terror at the yelling  and shouting that soundedaround.\"\\nThey flew into the tower and out again, they looked  downupon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of thechurch, and  screamed out aloud what they saw there.\"\\nKing Canuteknelt before the altar in prayer;  his brothers Eric and Benedict stoodby him as a guard with drawn swords; but the King\\'s  servant, thetreacherous Blake, betrayed his master.\"\\nThe throng in front of thechurch  knew where they could hit the King, and one of them flung astone through a pane of  glass, and the King lay there dead!\"\\nThecries and screams of the savage horde and of  the birds sounded throughthe air, and I joined in it also; for I sang \\'Ding-dong!\"\\n ding-dong!\\'  \"The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees thebirds around it, and  understands their language.\"\\nThe wind roars inupon it through windows and loopholes;  and the wind knowseverything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all  things,and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out intothe world,  \\'Ding-dong!\"\\nding-dong!\\'  \"But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not ableany longer to ring  it out.\"\\nI became so tired, so heavy, that thebeam broke, and I flew out into the  gleaming Au, where the water isdeepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and  alone; and yearby year I tell him what I have heard and what I know.\"\\n Ding-dong!ding-dong\"  Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in theOdense-Au.\"\\nThat is what  grandmother told us.\"\\n But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rungdown there, for that  it could not do so; and that no Au-mann dweltyonder, for there was no Au-mann at all!\"\\n And when all the other churchbells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not really  the bellsthat are sounding, but that it is the air itself which sends forth thenotes;  and grandmother said to us that the Bell itself said it was theair who told it to  him, consequently they are agreed on that point,and this much is sure.\"\\n \"Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself,\" theyboth say.\"\\n The air knows everything.\"\\nIt is around us, it is in us, it talksof our thoughts and  of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them thandoes the Bell down in the depths of  the Odense-Au where the Au-manndwells.\"\\nIt rings it out in the vault of heaven, far,  far out,forever and ever, till the heaven bells sound \"Ding-dong!\"\\nding-dong!\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BIRD OF POPULAR SONG  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT is winter-time.\"\\nThe earth wears a snowy garment, and looks likemarble hewn out  of the rock; the air is bright and clear; the windis sharp as a well-tempered sword,  and the trees stand like branchesof white coral or blooming almond twigs, and here  it is keen as on thelofty Alps.\"\\n The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, andin the glitter of  innumerable twinkling stars.\"\\n But we sit in the warm room, by the hot stove, and talk aboutthe old times.\"\\nAnd we  listen to this story:  By the open sea was a giant\\'s grave; and on the grave-mound sat atmidnight the spirit  of the buried hero, who had been a king.\"\\nThegolden circlet gleamed on his brow, his  hair fluttered in the wind,and he was clad in steel and iron.\"\\nHe bent his head  mournfully, andsighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.\"\\n And a ship came sailing by.\"\\nPresently the sailors lowered theanchor and landed.\"\\nAmong  them was a singer, and he approached theroyal spirit, and said,  \"Why mournest thou, and wherefore dost thou suffer thus?\"\\n  And the dead man answered,  \"No one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead andforgotten.\"\\nSong doth not carry  them forth over the lands, nor into thehearts of men; therefore I have no rest and  no peace.\"\\n  And he spoke of his works, and of his warlike deeds, which hiscontemporaries had known,  but which had not been sung, because therewas no singer among his companions.\"\\n Then the old bard struck the strings of his harp, and sang ofthe youthful courage  of the hero, of the strength of the man, and ofthe greatness of his good deeds.\"\\nThen  the face of the dead one gleamedlike the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.\"\\nGladly  and of goodcourage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, and vanishedlike the  glancing of the northern light.\"\\nNought was to be seen but thegreen turfy mound, with  the stones on which no Runic record has beengraven; but at the last sound of the harp  there soared over thehill, as though he had fluttered from the harp, a little bird,  acharming singing-bird, with ringing voice of the thrush, with themoving voice pathos  of the human heart, with a voice that told ofhome, like the voice that is heard by  the bird of passage.\"\\nThesinging-bird soared away, over mountain and valley, over field  andwood- he was the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies.\"\\n We hear his song- we hear it now in the room while the whitebees are swarming without,  and the storm clutches the windows.\"\\nThebird sings not alone the requiem of heroes;  he sings also sweet gentlesongs of love, so many and so warm, of Northern fidelity  and truth.\"\\nHehas stories in words and in tones; he has proverbs and snatches ofproverbs;  songs which, like Runes laid under a dead man\\'s tongue,force him to speak; and thus  Popular Song tells of the land of hisbirth.\"\\n In the old heathen days, in the times of the Vikings, thepopular speech was enshrined  in the harp of the bard.\"\\n In the days of knightly castles, when the strongest fist heldthe scales of justice,  when only might was right, and a peasant anda dog were of equal importance, where  did the Bird of Song findshelter and protection?\"\\nNeither violence nor stupidity gave  him athought.\"\\n But in the gabled window of the knightly castle, the lady of thecastle sat with the  parchment roll before her, and wrote down theold recollections in song and legend,  while near her stood the oldwoman from the wood, and the travelling peddler who went  wanderingthrough the country.\"\\nAs these told their tales, there fluttered aroundthem,  with twittering and song, the Bird of Popular Song, who neverdies so long as the earth  has a hill upon which his foot may rest.\"\\n And now he looks in upon us and sings.\"\\nWithout are the night andthe snow-storm.\"\\nHe  lays the Runes beneath our tongues, and we know theland of our home.\"\\nHeaven speaks  to us in our native tongue, in thevoice of the Bird of Popular Song.\"\\nThe old  remembrances awake, thefaded colors glow with a fresh lustre, and story and song pour  us ablessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts, so that theevening  becomes as a Christmas festival.\"\\n The snow-flakes chase each other, the ice cracks, the stormrules without, for he has  the might, he is lord- but not the LORD OFALL.\"\\n It is winter time.\"\\nThe wind is sharp as a two-edged sword, thesnow-flakes chase each  other; it seems as though it had been snowingfor days and weeks, and the snow lies  like a great mountain over thewhole town, like a heavy dream of the winter night.\"\\n Everything onthe earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of the church, thesymbol  of faith, arises over the snow grave, and gleams in the blueair and in the bright  sunshine.\"\\n And over the buried town fly the birds of heaven, the small andthe great;

and we are quite near the roaring.\"\\nBefore usrises a great  mound of sand- a mountain we have long seen, and towardswhich we are wending our way,  driving slowly along through the deepsand.\"\\nOn this mountain of sand is a lofty old  building- the convent ofBorglum.\"\\nIn one of its wings (the larger one) there is still  a church.And at this convent we now arrive in the late evening hour; but theweather  is clear in the bright June night around us, and the eye canrange far, far over field  and moor to the Bay of Aalborg, over heathand meadow, and far across the deep blue  sea.\"\\n Now we are there, and roll past between barns and other farmbuildings; and at the  left of the gate we turn aside to the Old CastleFarm, where the lime trees stand in  lines along the walls, and,sheltered from the wind and weather, grow so luxuriantly  that theirtwigs and leaves almost conceal the windows.\"\\n We mount the winding staircase of stone, and march through thelong passages under  the heavy roof-beams.\"\\nThe wind moans verystrangely here, both within and without.\"\\n It is hardly known how, butthe people say- yes, people say a great many things when  they arefrightened or want to frighten others- they say that the old deadchoir-men  glide silently past us into the church, where mass issung.\"\\nThey can be heard in the  rushing of the storm, and their singingbrings up strange thoughts in the hearers\\ufffethoughts of the old timesinto which we are carried back.\"\\n On the coast a ship is stranded; and the bishop\\'s warriors arethere, and spare not  those whom the sea has spared.\"\\nThe sea washesaway the blood that has flowed from the  cloven skulls.\"\\nThe strandedgoods belong to the bishop, and there is a store of goods  here.\"\\nThesea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for theconvent cellar,  and in the convent is already good store of beer andmead.\"\\nThere is plenty in the  kitchen- dead game and poultry, hamsand sausages; and fat fish swim in the ponds  without.\"\\n The Bishop of Borglum is a mighty lord.\"\\nHe has greatpossessions, but still he longs  for more- everything must bow beforethe mighty Olaf Glob.\"\\nHis rich cousin at Thyland  is dead, and hiswidow is to have the rich inheritance.\"\\nBut how comes it that  onerelation is always harder towards another than even strangers wouldbe?\"\\nThe widow\\'s  husband had possessed all Thyland, with theexception of the church property.\"\\nHer son  was not at home.\"\\nIn hisboyhood he had already started on a journey, for his desire  was to seeforeign lands and strange people.\"\\nFor years there had been no newsof him.\"\\n Perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would nevercome back to his home,  to rule where his mother then ruled.\"\\n \"What has a woman to do with rule?\"\\n said the bishop.\"\\n He summoned the widow before a law court; but what did he gainthereby?\"\\nThe widow had  never been disobedient to the law, and wasstrong in her just rights.\"\\n Bishop Olaf of Borglum, what dost thou purpose?\"\\nWhat writestthou on yonder smooth  parchment, sealing it with thy seal, andintrusting it to the horsemen and servants,  who ride away, far away,to the city of the Pope?\"\\n It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships, and soonicy winter will come.\"\\n Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed thehorsemen and servants  back to their home.\"\\nThey came from Rome with apapal decree- a ban, or bull, against  the widow who had dared tooffend the pious bishop.\"\\n\"Cursed be she and all that belongs  to her.Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church.\"\\nLet no manstretch  forth a helping hand to her, and let friends and relationsavoid her as a plague and  a pestilence!\"\\n  \"What will not bend must break,\" said the Bishop of Borglum  And all forsake the widow; but she holds fast to her God.\"\\nHe isher helper and defender.\"\\n One servant only- an old maid- remained faithful to her; andwith the old servant,  the widow herself followed the plough; and thecrop grew, although the land had been  cursed by the Pope and by thebishop.\"\\n \"Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!\"\\ncried the Bishop of Borglum.\"\\n \"Now will I lay the hand of the Pope uponthee, to summon thee before the tribunal  that shall condemn thee!\"\\n  Then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to herto a wagon, and mounted  up on the wagon, with her old servant, andtravelled away across the heath out of the  Danish land.\"\\nAs astranger she came into a foreign country, where a strange tongue  wasspoken and where new customs prevailed.\"\\nFarther and farther shejourneyed, to where  green hills rise into mountains, and the vineclothes their sides.\"\\nStrange merchants  drive by her, and they lookanxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise.\"\\nThey  fear anattack from the armed followers of the robber-knights.\"\\nThe two poorwomen, in  their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen, travelfearlessly through the dangerous  sunken road and through thedarksome forest.\"\\nAnd now they were in Franconia.\"\\nAnd there  met thema stalwart knight, with a train of twelve armed followers.\"\\nHepaused, gazed  at the strange vehicle, and questioned the women as tothe goal of their journey and  the place whence they came.\"\\nThen oneof them mentioned Thyland in Denmark, and spoke  of her sorrows, of herwoes, which were soon to cease, for so Divine Providence had  willedit.\"\\nFor the stranger knight is the widow\\'s son!\"\\nHe seized her hand, heembraced  her, and the mother wept.\"\\nFor years she had not been ableto weep, but had only bitten  her lips till the blood started.\"\\n It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships, and soonwill icy winter come.\"\\n The sea rolled wine-tubs to the shore for the bishop\\'s cellar.In the kitchen the deer  roasted on the spit before the fire.\"\\nAtBorglum it was warm and cheerful in the heated  rooms, while coldwinter raged without, when a piece of news was brought to thebishop.\"\\n \"Jens Glob, of Thyland, has come back, and his mother withhim.\"\\n Jens Glob laid a  complaint against the bishop, and summonedhim before the temporal and the spiritual  court.\"\\n \"That will avail him little,\" said the bishop.\"\\n\"Best leave off thyefforts, knight  Jens.\"\\n  Again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships.\"\\nIcywinter comes again,  and the \"white bees\" are swarming, and sting thetraveller\\'s face till they melt.\"\\n \"Keen weather to-day!\"\\n say the people, as they step in.\"\\n Jens Glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought, that he singesthe skirt of his wide  garment.\"\\n \"Thou Borglum bishop,\" he exclaims, \"I shall subdue thee afterall!\"\\nUnder the shield  of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but JensGlob shall reach thee!\"\\n  Then he writes a letter to his brother-in-law, Olaf Hase, inSallingland, and prays  that knight to meet him on Christmas eve, atmass, in the church at Widberg.\"\\nThe bishop  himself is to read themass, and consequently will journey from Borglum to Thyland;  andthis is known to Jens Glob.\"\\n Moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow.\"\\nThe marshwill bear horse and rider,  the bishop with his priests and armedmen.\"\\nThey ride the shortest way, through the  waving reeds, where thewind moans sadly.\"\\n Blow thy brazen trumpet, thou trumpeter clad in fox-skin!\"\\nitsounds merrily in the  clear air.\"\\nSo they ride on over heath andmoorland- over what is the garden of Fata  Morgana in the hot summer,though now icy, like all the country- towards the church  of Widberg.\"\\n The wind is blowing his trumpet too- blowing it harder and harder.He blows up a storm\\ufffea terrible storm- that increases more and more.Towards the church they ride, as fast  as they may through the storm.The church stands firm, but the storm careers on over  field andmoorland, over land and sea.\"\\n Borglum\\'s bishop reaches the church; but Olaf Hase will scarcedo so, however hard  he may ride.\"\\nHe journeys with his warriors onthe farther side of the bay, in order  that he may help Jens Glob,now that the bishop is to be summoned before the judgment  seat ofthe Highest.\"\\n The church is the judgment hall; the altar is the council table.The lights burn clear  in the heavy brass candelabra.\"\\nThe storm readsout the accusation and the sentence,  roaming in the air over moorand heath, and over the rolling waters.\"\\nNo ferry-boat  can sail overthe bay in such weather as this.\"\\n Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.\"\\nThere he dismisses hiswarriors, presents them  with their horses and harness, and givesthem leave to ride home and greet his wife.\"\\n He intends to risk hislife alone in the roaring waters; but they are to bear witness  for himthat it is not his fault if Jens Glob stands without reinforcementin the church  at Widberg.\"\\nThe faithful warriors will not leave him,but follow him out into the deep  waters.\"\\nTen of them are carried away;but Olaf Hase and two of the youngest men reach  the farther side.\"\\nTheyhave still four miles to ride.\"\\n It is past midnight.\"\\nIt is Christmas.\"\\nThe wind has abated.\"\\nThechurch is lighted up;  the gleaming radiance shines through thewindow-frames, and pours out over meadow and  heath.\"\\nThe mass haslong been finished, silence reigns in the church, and the wax is  hearddropping from the candles to the stone pavement.\"\\nAnd now Olaf Hasearrives.\"\\n In the forecourt Jens Glob greets him kindly, and says,  \"I have just made an agreement with the bishop.\"\\n  \"Sayest thou so?\"\\n replied Olaf Hase.\"\\n\"Then neither thou nor thebishop shall quit this  church alive.\"\\n  And the sword leaps from the scabbard, and Olaf Hase deals ablow that makes the panel  of the church door, which Jens Globhastily closes between them, fly in fragments.\"\\n \"Hold, brother!\"\\nFirst hear what the agreement was that I made.\"\\nIhave slain the bishop  and his warriors and priests.\"\\nThey will haveno word more to say in the matter, nor  will I speak again of all thewrong that my mother has endured.\"\\n  The long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red; but there is aredder gleam upon the  pavement, where the bishop lies with clovenskull, and his dead warriors around him,  in the quiet of the holyChristmas night.\"\\n And four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in theconvent of Borglum.\"\\nThe  murdered bishop and the slain warriors andpriests are displayed under a black canopy,  surrounded by candelabradecked with crape.\"\\nThere lies the dead man, in the black cloak  wroughtwith silver; the crozier in the powerless hand that was once somighty.\"\\nThe  incense rises in clouds, and the monks chant the funeralhymn.\"\\nIt sounds like a wail\\ufffeit sounds like a sentence of wrath andcondemnation, that must be heard far over the  land, carried by thewind- sung by the wind- the wail that sometimes is silent, but  neverdies; for ever again it rises in song, singing even into our owntime this legend  of the Bishop of Borglum and his hard nephew.\"\\nIt isheard in the dark night by the  frightened husbandman, driving by inthe heavy sandy road past the convent of Borglum.\"\\n It is heard by thesleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at Borglum.\"\\nAnd  notonly to the ear of superstition is the sighing and the tread ofhurrying feet audible  in the long echoing passages leading to theconvent door that has long been locked.\"\\n The door still seems toopen, and the lights seem to flame in the brazen candlesticks;  thefragrance of incense arises; the church gleams in its ancientsplendor; and the  monks sing and say the mass over the slain bishop,who lies there in the black  silver-embroidered mantle, with thecrozier in his powerless hand; and on his pale  proud forehead gleamsthe red wound like fire, and there burn the worldly mind and  thewicked thoughts.\"\\n Sink down into his grave- into oblivion- ye terrible shapes of thetimes of old!\"\\n Hark to the raging of the angry wind, sounding above the rollingsea!\"\\nA storm approaches  without, calling aloud for human lives.\"\\nThesea has not put on a new mind with the  new time.\"\\nThis night it is ahorrible pit to devour up lives, and to-morrow, perhaps,  it may be aglassy mirror- even as in the old time that we have buried.\"\\nSleepsweetly,  if thou canst sleep!\"\\n Now it is morning.\"\\n The new time flings sunshine into the room.\"\\nThe wind still keepsup mightily.\"\\nA wreck  is announced- as in the old time.\"\\n During the night, down yonder by Lokken, the little fishingvillage with the red-tiled  roofs- we can see it up here from thewindow- a ship has come ashore.\"\\nIt has struck,  and is fast embedded inthe sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board,  andformed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all on board aresaved, and  reach the land, and are wrapped in warm blankets; andto-day they are invited to the  farm at the convent of Borglum.\"\\nIncomfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and  friendly faces.They are addressed in the language of their country, and the  pianosounds for them with melodies of their native land; and before thesehave died  away, the chord has been struck, the wire of thought thatreaches to the land of the  sufferers announces that they arerescued.\"\\nThen their anxieties are dispelled; and  at even they joinin the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.Waltzes  and Styrian dances are given, and Danish popular songs, andmelodies of foreign lands  in these modern times.\"\\n Blessed be thou, new time!\"\\nSpeak thou of summer and of purergales!\"\\nSend thy sunbeams  gleaming into our hearts and thoughts!\"\\nOn thyglowing canvas let them be painted- the  dark legends of the rough hardtimes that are past!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BOTTLE NECK  by Hans Christian Andersen  CLOSE to the corner of a street, among other abodes of poverty,stood an exceedingly  tall, narrow house, which had been so knockedabout by time that it seemed out of joint  in every direction.\"\\nThishouse was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest poverty  wasapparent in the garret lodging in the gable.\"\\nIn front of the littlewindow, an old  bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine, which had not evena proper water-glass, but  instead of it the broken neck of a bottle,turned upside down, and a cork stuck in  to make it hold the water withwhich it was filled.\"\\nAn old maid stood at the window;  she had hungchickweed over the cage, and the little linnet which it containedhopped  from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily.\"\\n \"Yes, it\\'s all very well for you to sing,\" said the bottle neck:that is, he did not  really speak the words as we do, for the neck of abottle cannot speak; but he thought  them to himself in his own mind,just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.\"\\n \"Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured;you should feel what  it is like to lose your body, and only have aneck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck  in it, as I have: youwouldn\\'t sing then, I know.\"\\nAfter all, it is just as well that  thereare some who can be happy.\"\\nI have no reason to sing, nor could Ising now if I  were ever so happy; but when I was a whole bottle, andthey rubbed me with a cork,  didn\\'t I sing then?\"\\nI used to be calleda complete lark.\"\\nI remember when I went out  to a picnic with thefurrier\\'s family, on the day his daughter was betrothed,- it  seemsas if it only happened yesterday.\"\\nI have gone through a great dealin my time,  when I come to recollect: I have been in the fire and inthe water, I have been deep  in the earth, and have mounted higher inthe air than most other people, and now I  am swinging here, outsidea bird-cage, in the air and the sunshine.\"\\nOh, indeed, it  would beworth while to hear my history; but I do not speak it aloud, for agood reason\\ufffebecause I cannot.\"\\n  Then the bottle neck related his history, which was reallyrather remarkable; he, in  fact, related it to himself, or, at least,thought it in his own mind.\"\\nThe little bird  sang his own song merrily;in the street below there was driving and running to and  fro, everyone thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; butthe bottle  neck thought deeply.\"\\nHe thought of the blazing furnace inthe factory, where he had  been blown into life; he remembered howhot it felt when he was placed in the heated  oven, the home from whichhe sprang, and that he had a strong inclination to leap out  againdirectly; but after a while it became cooler, and he found himselfvery  comfortable.\"\\nHe had been placed in a row, with a whole regimentof his brothers and  sisters all brought out of the same furnace;some of them had certainly been blown  into champagne bottles, andothers into beer bottles, which made a little difference  between them.In the world it often happens that a beer bottle may contain themost  precious wine, and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking,but even in decay it  may always be seen whether a man has been wellborn.\"\\nNobility remains noble, as a  champagne bottle remains thesame, even with blacking in its interior.\"\\nWhen the bottles  were packedour bottle was packed amongst them; it little expected then tofinish its  career as a bottle neck, or to be used as a water-glassto a bird\\'s-cage, which is,  after all, a place of honor, for it isto be of some use in the world.\"\\nThe bottle did  not behold the light ofday again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the  winemerchant\\'s cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, whichcaused some  very curious sensations.\"\\nThere it lay empty, and without acork, and it had a peculiar  feeling, as if it wanted something it knewnot what.\"\\nAt last it was filled with rich  and costly wine, a corkwas placed in it, and sealed down.\"\\nThen it was labelled  \"firstquality,\" as if it had carried off the first prize at anexamination; besides,  the wine and the bottle were both good, andwhile we are young is the time for poetry.\"\\n There were sounds of songwithin the bottle, of things it could not understand, of  green sunnymountains, where the vines grow and where the merry vine-dresserslaugh,  sing, and are merry.\"\\n\"Ah, how beautiful is life.\"\\n All thesetones of joy and song in  the bottle were like the working of a youngpoet\\'s brain, who often knows not the  meaning of the tones which aresounding within him.\"\\nOne morning the bottle found a  purchaser in thefurrier\\'s apprentice, who was told to bring one of the best bottles  ofwine.\"\\nIt was placed in the provision basket with ham and cheese andsausages.\"\\nThe  sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put intothe basket by the furrier\\'s  daughter herself, for she packed it.\"\\nShewas young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed,  and a smile lingeredround her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes.\"\\nShe had delicatehands,  beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still.\"\\nIt couldeasily be seen that she  was a very lovely girl, and as yet she was notengaged.\"\\nThe provision basket lay in  the lap of the young girl asthe family drove out to the forest, and the neck of the  bottlepeeped out from between the folds of the white napkin.\"\\nThere was thered wax  on the cork, and the bottle looked straight at the younggirl\\'s face, and also at the  face of the young sailor who sat nearher.\"\\nHe was a young friend, the son of a portrait  painter.\"\\nHe hadlately passed his examination with honor, as mate, and the nextmorning  he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast.\"\\nThere hadbeen a great deal of talk  on this subject while the basket was beingpacked, and during this conversation the  eyes and the mouth of thefurrier\\'s daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.\"\\n The youngpeople wandered away into the green wood, and talked together.\"\\nWhatdid they  talk about?\"\\nThe bottle could not say, for he was in theprovision basket.\"\\nIt remained  there a long time; but when at last itwas brought forth it appeared as if something  pleasant had happened,for every one was laughing; the furrier\\'s daughter laughed too,  butshe said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.\"\\nThen herfather took the  bottle and the cork-screw into his hands.\"\\nWhat astrange sensation it was to have the  cork drawn for the first time!The bottle could never after that forget the performance  of thatmoment; indeed there was quite a convulsion within him as the corkflew out,  and a gurgling sound as the wine was poured forth into theglasses.\"\\n \"Long life to the betrothed,\" cried the papa, and every glasswas emptied to the dregs,  while the young sailor kissed hisbeautiful bride.\"\\n \"Happiness and blessing to you both,\" said the old people-fatherand mother, and the  young man filled the glasses again.\"\\n \"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year,\" he cried; andwhen the glasses were  empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, andsaid, \"Thou hast been present here  on the happiest day of my life;thou shalt never be used by others!\"\\n So saying, he  hurled it high inthe air.\"\\n The furrier\\'s daughter thought she should never see it again,but she was mistaken.\"\\n It fell among the rushes on the borders of alittle woodland lake.\"\\nThe bottle neck  remembered well how long itlay there unseen.\"\\n\"I gave them wine, and they gave me muddy  water,\" hehad said to himself, \"but I suppose it was all well meant.\"\\n He couldno longer  see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; butfor a long time he could  hear them rejoicing and singing.\"\\nAt lengththere came by two peasant boys, who peeped  in among the reeds andspied out the bottle.\"\\nThen they took it up and carried it home  withthem, so that once more it was provided for.\"\\nAt home in their woodencottage these  boys had an elder brother, a sailor, who was about tostart on a long voyage.\"\\nHe had  been there the day before to sayfarewell, and his mother was now very busy packing  up various thingsfor him to take with him on his voyage.\"\\nIn the evening his fatherwas  going to carry the parcel to the town to see his son once more,and take him a farewell  greeting from his mother.\"\\nA small bottle hadalready been filled with herb tea, mixed  with brandy, and wrapped in aparcel; but when the boys came in they brought with them  a largerand stronger bottle, which they had found.\"\\nThis bottle would hold somuch more  than the little one, and they all said the brandy would beso good for complaints of  the stomach, especially as it was mixed withmedical herbs.\"\\nThe liquid which they now  poured into the bottle wasnot like the red wine with which it had once been filled;  these werebitter drops, but they are of great use sometimes-for the stomach.\"\\nThenew  large bottle was to go, not the little one: so the bottle oncemore started on its  travels.\"\\nIt was taken on board (for Peter Jensenwas one of the crew) the very same  ship in which the young mate was tosail.\"\\nBut the mate did not see the bottle: indeed,  if he had hewould not have known it, or supposed it was the one out of whichthey had  drunk to the felicity of the betrothed and to the prospect ofa marriage on his own  happy return.\"\\nCertainly the bottle no longerpoured forth wine, but it contained  something quite as good; and so ithappened that whenever Peter Jensen brought it out,  his messmates gaveit the name of \"the apothecary,\" for it contained the best medicine  tocure the stomach, and he gave it out quite willingly as long as a dropremained.\"\\n Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbedwith a cork, and it was  called a great lark,\" \"Peter Jensen\\'s lark.\"\\n  Long days and months rolled by, during which the bottle stoodempty in a corner, when  a storm arose- whether on the passage out orhome it could not tell, for it had never  been ashore.\"\\nIt was aterrible storm, great waves arose, darkly heaving and tossing  thevessel to and fro.\"\\nThe main mast was split asunder, the ship spranga leak, and  the pumps became useless, while all around was black asnight.\"\\nAt the last moment,  when the ship was sinking, the young matewrote on a piece of paper, \"We are going  down: God\\'s will be done.\"\\nThen he wrote the name of his betrothed, his own name, and  that of theship.\"\\nThen he put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened to be athand,  corked it down tightly, and threw it into the foaming sea.\"\\nHeknew not that it was  the very same bottle from which the goblet of joyand hope had once been filled for  him, and now it was tossing on thewaves with his last greeting, and a message from  the dead.\"\\nThe shipsank, and the crew sank with her; but the bottle flew on like abird,  for it bore within it a loving letter from a loving heart.\"\\nAndas the sun rose and  set, the bottle felt as at the time of its firstexistence, when in the heated glowing  stove it had a longing to flyaway.\"\\nIt outlived the storms and the calm, it struck  against no rocks,was not devoured by sharks, but drifted on for more than a  year,sometimes towards the north, sometimes towards the south, just asthe current  carried it.\"\\nIt was in all other ways its own master, buteven of that one may get tired.\"\\n The written leaf, the last farewell ofthe bridegroom to his bride, would only bring  sorrow when once itreached her hands; but where were those hands, so soft and  delicate,which had once spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in thegreen wood,  on the day of her betrothal?\"\\nAh, yes!\"\\nwhere was thefurrier\\'s daughter?\"\\nand where was  the land which might lie nearestto her home?\"\\n The bottle knew not, it travelled onward and onward, and at lastall this wandering  about became wearisome; at all events it was notits usual occupation.\"\\nBut it had to  travel, till at length itreached land- a foreign country.\"\\nNot a word spoken in this  countrycould the bottle understand; it was a language it had never beforeheard, and  it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language.The bottle was fished out  of the water, and examined on all sides.\"\\nThelittle letter contained within it was  discovered, taken out, andturned and twisted in every direction; but the people could  notunderstand what was written upon it.\"\\nThey could be quite sure that thebottle had  been thrown overboard from a vessel, and that somethingabout it was written on this  paper: but what was written?\"\\nthat was thequestion,- so the paper was put back into  the bottle, and then bothwere put away in a large cupboard of one of the great houses  of thetown.\"\\nWhenever any strangers arrived, the paper was taken out andturned over  and over, so that the address, which was only written inpencil, became almost  illegible, and at last no one coulddistinguish any letters on it at all.\"\\nFor a whole  year the bottleremained standing in the cupboard, and then it was taken up to theloft,  where it soon became covered with dust and cobwebs.\"\\nAh!\"\\nhowoften then it thought of  those better days- of the times when in thefresh, green wood, it had poured forth  rich wine; or, while rockedby the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom a secret,  a letter,a last parting sigh.\"\\nFor full twenty years it stood in the loft, andit might  have stayed there longer but that the house was going to berebuilt.\"\\nThe bottle was  discovered when the roof was taken off; theytalked about it, but the bottle did not  understand what they said- alanguage is not to be learnt by living in a loft, even  for twentyyears.\"\\n\"If I had been down stairs in the room,\" thought the bottle, \"Imight  have learnt it.\"\\n It was now washed and rinsed, which process wasreally quite necessary,  and afterwards it looked clean andtransparent, and felt young again in its old age;  but the paperwhich it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing.They  filled the bottle with seeds, though it scarcely knew what hadbeen placed in it.\"\\nThen  they corked it down tightly, and carefullywrapped it up.\"\\nThere not even the light  of a torch or lantern couldreach it, much less the brightness of the sun or moon.\"\\n \"And yet,\"thought the bottle, \"men go on a journey that they may see as muchas possible,  and I can see nothing.\"\\n However, it did something quiteas important; it travelled  to the place of its destination, and wasunpacked.\"\\n \"What trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder!\"\\nsaid one, and very likely  it is broken after all.\"\\n But the bottlewas not broken, and, better still, it understood  every word that wassaid: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the  winemerchant\\'s; in the forest and on the ship,- it was the only good oldlanguage it  could understand.\"\\nIt had returned home, and the languagewas as a welcome greeting.\"\\n For very joy, it felt ready to jump outof people\\'s hands, and scarcely noticed that  its cork had beendrawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried  to acellar, to be left there and forgotten.\"\\n\"There\\'s no place like home,even if it\\'s  a cellar.\"\\n It never occurred to him to think that hemight lie there for years, he  felt so comfortable.\"\\nFor many long yearshe remained in the cellar, till at last some  people came to carry awaythe bottles, and ours amongst the number.\"\\n Out in the garden there was a great festival.\"\\nBrilliant lamps hungin festoons from  tree to tree; and paper lanterns, through which thelight shone till they looked like  transparent tulips.\"\\nIt was abeautiful evening, and the weather mild and clear.\"\\nThe  stars twinkled;and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by  theshadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with agolden rim:  it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.The illumination extended even  to the most retired of the gardenwalks, at least not so retired that any one need  lose himself there.In the borders were placed bottles, each containing a light, and  amongthem the bottle with which we are acquainted, and whose fate it was,one day,  to be only a bottle neck, and to serve as a water-glass toa bird\\'s-cage.\"\\nEverything  here appeared lovely to our bottle, for itwas again in the green wood, amid joy and  feasting; again it heardmusic and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially  inthat part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanternsdisplayed  their brilliant colors.\"\\nIt stood in a distant walkcertainly, but a place pleasant  for contemplation; and it carried alight; and was at once useful and ornamental.\"\\nIn  such an hour it iseasy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a  goodthing it is to be able to do so.\"\\nClose before the bottle passed asingle pair,  like the bridal pair- the mate and the furrier\\'sdaughter- who had so long ago wandered  in the wood.\"\\nIt seemed to thebottle as if he were living that time over again.\"\\nNot  only theguests but other people were walking in the garden, who were allowedto witness  the splendor and the festivities.\"\\nAmong the latter camean old maid, who seemed to  be quite alone in the world.\"\\nShe wasthinking, like the bottle, of the green wood,  and of a young betrothedpair, who were closely connected with herself; she was  thinking ofthat hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, whenshe  had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours arenever to be forgotten,  let a maiden be as old as she may.\"\\nBut shedid not recognize the bottle, neither did  the bottle notice the oldmaid.\"\\nAnd so we often pass each other in the world when we  meet, asdid these two, even while together in the same town.\"\\n The bottle was taken from the garden, and again sent to a winemerchant, where it was  once more filled with wine, and sold to anaeronaut, who was to make an ascent in his  balloon on the followingSunday.\"\\nA great crowd assembled to witness the sight; military  musichad been engaged, and many other preparations made.\"\\nThe bottle sawit all from  the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit.\"\\nTherabbit was quite excited because  he knew that he was to be taken up,and let down again in a parachute.\"\\nThe bottle,  however, knew nothingof the \"up,\" or the \"down;\" he saw only that the balloon  wasswelling larger and larger till it could swell no more, and began torise and be  restless.\"\\nThen the ropes which held it were cut through,and the aerial ship rose in  the air with the aeronaut and the basketcontaining the bottle and the rabbit, while  the music sounded andall the people shouted \"Hurrah.\"\\n  \"This is a wonderful journey up into the air,\" thought the bottle;\"it is a new way  of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear ofstriking against anything.\"\\n  Thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid who wasin the garden saw  it also; for she stood at the open window of thegarret, by which hung the cage  containing the linnet, who then hadno water-glass, but was obliged to be contented  with an old cup.\"\\nInthe window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed  alittle on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid wasleaning out of  the window, that she might see.\"\\nAnd she did seedistinctly the aeronaut in the balloon,  and how he let down the rabbitin the parachute, and then drank to the health of all  the spectatorsin the wine from the bottle.\"\\nAfter doing this, he hurled it highinto  the air.\"\\nHow little she thought that this was the very samebottle which her friend  had thrown aloft in her honor, on that happyday of rejoicing, in the green wood, in  her youthful days.\"\\nThebottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before  itwas aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in itslife.\"\\nSteeples  and roofs lay far, far beneath it, and the peoplelooked as tiny as possible.\"\\nThen  it began to descend much more rapidlythan the rabbit had done, made somersaults in  the air, and felt itselfquite young and unfettered, although it was half full of wine.\"\\n Butthis did not last long.\"\\nWhat a journey it was!\"\\nAll the people couldsee the bottle;  for the sun shone upon it.\"\\nThe balloon was already faraway, and very soon the bottle  was far away also; for it fell upon aroof, and broke in pieces.\"\\nBut the pieces had  got such an impetus inthem, that they could not stop themselves.\"\\nThey went jumping  androlling about, till at last they fell into the court-yard, and werebroken into  still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottlemanaged to keep whole, and it was  broken off as clean as if it hadbeen cut with a diamond.\"\\n \"That would make a capital bird\\'s glass,\" said one of thecellar-men; but none of them  had either a bird or a cage, and it wasnot to be expected they would provide one just  because they hadfound a bottle neck that could be used as a glass.\"\\nBut the old maidwho  lived in the garret had a bird, and it really might be useful toher; so the bottle  neck was provided with a cork, and taken up to her;and, as it often happens in life,  the part that had been uppermost wasnow turned downwards, and it was filled with fresh  water.\"\\nThen theyhung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered  moremerrily than ever.\"\\n \"Ah, you have good reason to sing,\" said the bottle neck, whichwas looked upon as  something very remarkable, because it had been in aballoon; nothing further was known  of its history.\"\\nAs it hung there inthe bird\\'s-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur  of the people inthe street below, as well as the conversation of the old maid in theroom  within.\"\\nAn old friend had just come to visit her, and theytalked, not about the bottle  neck, but of the myrtle in the window.\"\\n \"No, you must not spend a dollar for your daughter\\'s bridalbouquet,\" said the old  maid; \"you shall have a beautiful littlebunch for a nosegay, full of blossoms.\"\\nDo  you see how splendidly thetree has grown?\"\\nIt has been raised from only a little sprig  ofmyrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and fromwhich I was to make  my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed:but that day never came; the eyes were  closed which were to havebeen my light and joy through life.\"\\nIn the depths of the  sea mybeloved sleeps sweetly; the myrtle has become an old tree, and I ama still older  woman.\"\\nBefore the sprig you gave me faded, I took aspray, and planted it in the earth;  and now, as you see, it has becomea large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall  at last appear at awedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter.\"\\n  There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke ofthe beloved of her youth,  and of their betrothal in the wood.\"\\nManythoughts came into her mind; but the thought  never came, that quiteclose to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those  oldentimes,- the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted for joywhen the  cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.\"\\nBut thebottle neck did not recognize  the old maid; he had not beenlistening to what she had related, perhaps because he  was thinkingso much about her.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BRAVE TIN SOLDIER  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were allbrothers, for they had been  made out of the same old tin spoon.\"\\nTheyshouldered arms and looked straight before  them, and wore a splendiduniform, red and blue.\"\\nThe first thing in the world they  ever heardwere the words, \"Tin soldiers!\"\\n uttered by a little boy, who clappedhis  hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, wastaken off.\"\\nThey  were given him for a birthday present, and he stood atthe table to set them up.\"\\nThe  soldiers were all exactly alike,excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left  to the last, andthen there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so theymade  him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be veryremarkable.\"\\n The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered withother playthings, but the  most attractive to the eye was a prettylittle paper castle.\"\\nThrough the small windows  the rooms could beseen.\"\\nIn front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded  apiece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent atransparent lake.\"\\nSwans,  made of wax, swam on the lake, and werereflected in it.\"\\nAll this was very pretty,  but the prettiest of allwas a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the  castle; she,also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, witha narrow  blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf.\"\\nIn front ofthese was fixed a  glittering tinsel rose, as large as her wholeface.\"\\nThe little lady was a dancer, and  she stretched out both herarms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier  couldnot see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only oneleg.\"\\n\"That  is the wife for me,\" he thought; \"but she is too grand, andlives in a castle, while  I have only a box to live in, five-and-twentyof us altogether, that is no place for  her.\"\\nStill I must try andmake her acquaintance.\"\\n Then he laid himself at full length  on thetable behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peepat the little  delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg withoutlosing her balance.\"\\nWhen  evening came, the other tin soldiers were allplaced in the box, and the people of  the house went to bed.\"\\nThen theplaythings began to have their own games together,  to pay visits, tohave sham fights, and to give balls.\"\\nThe tin soldiers rattled in  theirbox; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they couldnot open the  lid.\"\\nThe nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the penciljumped about the table.\"\\nThere  was such a noise that the canary woke upand began to talk, and in poetry too.\"\\nOnly  the tin soldier and thedancer remained in their places.\"\\nShe stood on tiptoe, with  her legsstretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg.\"\\nHe never took hiseyes from  her for even a moment.\"\\nThe clock struck twelve, and, witha bounce, up sprang the lid  of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff,there jumped up a little black goblin; for  the snuff-box was a toypuzzle.\"\\n \"Tin soldier,\" said the goblin, \"don\\'t wish for what does notbelong to you.\"\\n But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.\"\\n \"Very well; wait till to-morrow, then,\" said the goblin.\"\\n When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tinsoldier in the window.\"\\n Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, orthe draught, is not known, but the window  flew open, and out fellthe tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into  thestreet beneath.\"\\nIt was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards,his helmet and  his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and hisone leg up in the air.\"\\nThe servant  maid and the little boy went downstairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere  to be seen,although once they nearly trod upon him.\"\\nIf he had called out, \"Here Iam,\"  it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out forhelp while he wore  a uniform.\"\\n Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster andfaster, till there was a  heavy shower.\"\\nWhen it was over, two boyshappened to pass by, and one of them said,  \"Look, there is a tinsoldier.\"\\nHe ought to have a boat to sail in.\"\\n  So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldierin it, and sent  him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran bythe side of it, and clapped  their hands.\"\\nGood gracious, what largewaves arose in that gutter!\"\\nand how fast the  stream rolled on!\"\\nfor therain had been very heavy.\"\\nThe paper boat rocked up and down,  andturned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldiertrembled; yet he  remained firm; his countenance did not change; helooked straight before him, and  shouldered his musket.\"\\nSuddenly theboat shot under a bridge which formed a part of  a drain, and then itwas as dark as the tin soldier\\'s box.\"\\n \"Where am I going now?\"\\n thought he.\"\\n\"This is the black goblin\\'sfault, I am sure.\"\\nAh,  well, if the little lady were only here withme in the boat, I should not care for  any darkness.\"\\n  Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain.\"\\n \"Have you a passport?\"\\n asked the rat, \"give it to me at once.\"\\n Butthe tin soldier  remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever.The boat sailed on and the rat  followed it.\"\\nHow he did gnash his teethand cry out to the bits of wood and straw,  \"Stop him, stop him; he hasnot paid toll, and has not shown his pass.\"\\n But the stream  rushed onstronger and stronger.\"\\nThe tin soldier could already see daylightshining  where the arch ended.\"\\nThen he heard a roaring sound quiteterrible enough to frighten  the bravest man.\"\\nAt the end of thetunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a  steep place, whichmade it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us.\"\\nHe was  tooclose to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldiercould only  hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving aneyelid, to show that he was  not afraid.\"\\nThe boat whirled round threeor four times, and then filled with water  to the very edge; nothingcould save it from sinking.\"\\nHe now stood up to his neck in  water,while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft andloose with  the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier\\'shead.\"\\nHe thought of the  elegant little dancer whom he should never seeagain, and the words of the song sounded  in his ears-  \"Farewell, warrior!\"\\never brave,  Drifting onward to thy grave.\"\\n  Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank intothe water and immediately  afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish.Oh how dark it was inside the fish!\"\\nA  great deal darker than in thetunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued  firm, andlay at full length shouldering his musket.\"\\nThe fish swam to and fro,making  the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quitestill.\"\\nAfter a while, a flash  of lightning seemed to pass through him,and then the daylight approached, and a voice  cried out, \"I declarehere is the tin soldier.\"\\n The fish had been caught, taken to  themarket and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut himopen with  a large knife.\"\\nShe picked up the soldier and held him by thewaist between her finger  and thumb, and carried him into the room.They were all anxious to see this wonderful  soldier who hadtravelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud.\"\\nTheyplaced  him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen in theworld!- there he was  in the very same room from the window of which hehad fallen, there were the same  children, the same playthings,standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the  elegant littledancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held  upthe other, so she was as firm as himself.\"\\nIt touched the tin soldierso much to see  her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept themback.\"\\nHe only looked at her and  they both remained silent.\"\\nPresentlyone of the little boys took up the tin soldier,  and threw him into thestove.\"\\nHe had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have  beenthe fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box.\"\\nThe flameslighted up  the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible,but whether it proceeded  from the real fire or from the fire of lovehe could not tell.\"\\nThen he could see that  the bright colors were fadedfrom his uniform, but whether they had been washed off  during hisjourney or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say.\"\\nHe lookedat  the little lady, and she looked at him.\"\\nHe felt himself meltingaway, but he still  remained firm with his gun on his shoulder.Suddenly the door of the room flew open  and the draught of aircaught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right  into thestove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flamesand was gone.\"\\n The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the nextmorning, when the maid servant  took the ashes out of the stove, shefound him in the shape of a little tin heart.\"\\n But of the little dancernothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black  as acinder.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BUCKWHEAT  by Hans Christian Andersen  VERY often, after a violent thunder-storm, a field of buckwheatappears blackened and  singed, as if a flame of fire had passed overit.\"\\nThe country people say that this  appearance is caused bylightning; but I will tell you what the sparrow says, and  thesparrow heard it from an old willow-tree which grew near a field ofbuckwheat, and  is there still.\"\\nIt is a large venerable tree, thougha little crippled by age.\"\\nThe  trunk has been split, and out of thecrevice grass and brambles grow.\"\\nThe tree bends  for-ward slightly, andthe branches hang quite down to the ground just like green  hair.Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not only rye and barley, butoats,-pretty  oats that, when ripe, look like a number of little goldencanary-birds sitting on a  bough.\"\\nThe corn has a smiling look and theheaviest and richest ears bend their heads  low as if in pioushumility.\"\\nOnce there was also a field of buckwheat, and this field  wasexactly opposite to old willow-tree.\"\\nThe buckwheat did not bend likethe other grain,  but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem.\"\\nI am as valuable as any other  corn,\" said he, \"and I am muchhandsomer; my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom  of the appleblossom, and it is a pleasure to look at us.\"\\nDo you know of anythingprettier  than we are, you old willow-tree?\"\\n  And the willow-tree nodded his head, as if he would say, \"Indeed Ido.\"\\n  But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said,\"Stupid tree; he is so old  that grass grows out of his body.\"\\n  There arose a very terrible storm.\"\\nAll the field-flowers foldedtheir leaves together,  or bowed their little heads, while the stormpassed over them, but the buckwheat stood  erect in its pride.\"\\n\"Bendyour head as we do,\" said the flowers.\"\\n \"I have no occasion to do so,\" replied the buckwheat.\"\\n \"Bend your head as we do,\" cried the ears of corn; \"the angel ofthe storm is coming;  his wings spread from the sky above to theearth beneath.\"\\nHe will strike you down before  you can cry for mercy.\"\\n  \"But I will not bend my head,\" said the buckwheat.\"\\n \"Close your flowers and bend your leaves,\" said the oldwillow-tree.\"\\n\"Do not look at  the lightning when the cloud bursts; evenmen cannot do that.\"\\nIn a flash of lightning  heaven opens, and we canlook in; but the sight will strike even human beings blind.\"\\n Whatthen must happen to us, who only grow out of the earth, and are soinferior to  them, if we venture to do so?\"\\n  \"Inferior, indeed!\"\\n said the buckwheat.\"\\n\"Now I intend to have apeep into heaven.\"\\n  Proudly and boldly he looked up, while thelightning flashed across the sky as if the  whole world were in flames.\"\\n When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the cornraised their drooping  heads in the pure still air, refreshed by therain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed  in the field, burnt toblackness by the lightning.\"\\nThe branches of the old  willow-treerustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leavesas  if the old willow were weeping.\"\\nThen the sparrows asked why he wasweeping, when all  around him seemed so cheerful.\"\\n\"See,\" they said,how the sun shines, and the clouds  float in the blue sky.\"\\nDo you notsmell the sweet perfume from flower and bush?\"\\n Wherefore do you weep,old willow-tree?\"\\n Then the willow told them of the haughty pride  ofthe buckwheat, and of the punishment which followed in consequence.\"\\n This is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when Ibegged them to relate  some tale to me.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE BUTTERFLY  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as maybe supposed, he wanted  to choose a very pretty one from among theflowers.\"\\nHe glanced, with a very critical  eye, at all the flower-beds,and found that the flowers were seated quietly and  demurely on theirstalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; butthere  was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his searchwould become very wearisome.\"\\n The butterfly did not like to take toomuch trouble, so he flew off on a visit to the  daisies.\"\\nThe Frenchcall this flower \"Marguerite,\" and they say that the little  daisycan prophesy.\"\\nLovers pluck off the leaves, and as they pluck eachleaf, they ask  a question about their lovers; thus: \"Does he or shelove me?- Ardently?\"\\nDistractedly?\"\\n Very much?\"\\nA little?\"\\nNot at all?\"\\nand so on.\"\\nEvery one speaks these words in his own  language.\"\\nThebutterfly came also to Marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck offher  leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought therewas always more to  be done by kindness.\"\\n \"Darling Marguerite daisy,\" he said to her, \"you are the wisestwoman of all the flowers.\"\\n Pray tell me which of the flowers I shallchoose for my wife.\"\\nWhich will be my bride?\"\\n When I know, I will flydirectly to her, and propose.\"\\n  But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he shouldcall her a woman  when she was only a girl; and there is a greatdifference.\"\\nHe asked her a second time,  and then a third; but sheremained dumb, and answered not a word.\"\\nThen he would wait  nolonger, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once.\"\\nIt was in theearly spring,  when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full bloom.\"\\n \"They are very pretty,\" thought the butterfly; \"charming littlelasses; but they are  rather formal.\"\\n  Then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the eldergirls.\"\\nHe next flew to  the anemones; these were rather sour to histaste.\"\\nThe violet, a little too sentimental.\"\\n The lime-blossoms, toosmall, and besides, there was such a large family of them.\"\\n Theapple-blossoms, though they looked like roses, bloomed to-day, butmight fall off  to-morrow, with the first wind that blew; and hethought that a marriage with one of  them might last too short atime.\"\\nThe pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was  white andred, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidenswho have  a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.\"\\nHewas just about to make  her an offer, when, close by the maiden, he sawa pod, with a withered flower hanging  at the end.\"\\n \"Who is that?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n \"That is my sister,\" replied the pea-blossom.\"\\n \"Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day,\" said he; and heflew away directly,  for he felt quite shocked.\"\\n A honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in full bloom; butthere were so many girls  like her, with long faces and sallowcomplexions.\"\\nNo; he did not like her.\"\\nBut which  one did he like?\"\\n Spring went by, and summer drew towards its close; autumn came;but he had not decided.\"\\n The flowers now appeared in their mostgorgeous robes, but all in vain; they had not  the fresh, fragrantair of youth.\"\\nFor the heart asks for fragrance, even when it is  nolonger young; and there is very little of that to be found in thedahlias or the  dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly turned tothe mint on the ground.\"\\nYou know,  this plant has no blossom; but it issweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head  to foot, with thescent of a flower in every leaf.\"\\n \"I will take her,\" said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.But the mint stood  silent and stiff, as she listened to him.\"\\nAt lastshe said,-  \"Friendship, if you please; nothing more.\"\\nI am old, and you areold, but we may live  for each other just the same; as to marrying- no;don\\'t let us appear ridiculous at  our age.\"\\n  And so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all.\"\\nHe hadbeen too long choosing,  which is always a bad plan.\"\\nAnd thebutterfly became what is called an old bachelor.\"\\n It was late in the autumn, with rainy and cloudy weather.\"\\nThe coldwind blew over the  bowed backs of the willows, so that they creakedagain.\"\\nIt was not the weather for  flying about in summer clothes;but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it.\"\\nHe  had got ashelter by chance.\"\\nIt was in a room heated by a stove, and as warmas summer.\"\\n He could exist here, he said, well enough.\"\\n \"But it is not enough merely to exist,\" said he, \"I needfreedom, sunshine, and a little  flower for a companion.\"\\n  Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admiredby those in the room,  who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, in a boxof curiosities.\"\\nThey could not do  more for him.\"\\n \"Now I am perched on a stalk, like the flowers,\" said thebutterfly.\"\\n\"It is not very  pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it issomething like being married; for here  I am stuck fast.\"\\n And with thisthought he consoled himself a little.\"\\n \"That seems very poor consolation,\" said one of the plants inthe room, that grew in  a pot.\"\\n \"Ah,\" thought the butterfly, \"one can\\'t very well trust theseplants in pots; they  have too much to do with mankind.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE CHILD IN THE GRAVE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT was a very sad day, and every heart in the house felt thedeepest grief; for the  youngest child, a boy of four years old, thejoy and hope of his parents, was dead.\"\\n Two daughters, the elder ofwhom was going to be confirmed, still remained: they were  both good,charming girls; but the lost child always seems the dearest; andwhen it  is youngest, and a son, it makes the trial still more heavy.The sisters mourned as  young hearts can mourn, and were especiallygrieved at the sight of their parents\\'  sorrow.\"\\nThe father\\'s heartwas bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the  deep grief.Day and night she had attended to the sick child, nursing and carryingit  in her bosom, as a part of herself.\"\\nShe could not realize thefact that the child was  dead, and must be laid in a coffin to restin the ground.\"\\nShe thought God could not  take her darling little onefrom her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes  and herbelief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said inher feverish  agony, \"God does not know it.\"\\nHe has hard-heartedministering spirits on earth, who  do according to their own will,and heed not a mother\\'s prayers.\"\\n Thus in her great  grief she fellaway from her faith in God, and dark thoughts arose in her mindrespecting  death and a future state.\"\\nShe tried to believe that man wasbut dust, and that with  his life all existence ended.\"\\nBut these doubtswere no support to her, nothing on which  she could rest, and shesunk into the fathomless depths of despair.\"\\nIn her darkest  hours sheceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who werestill left  to her.\"\\nThe tears of her husband fell on her forehead,but she took no notice of him;  her thoughts were with her deadchild; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the  remembrances ofthe little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.\"\\n The day of the little child\\'s funeral came.\"\\nFor nightspreviously the mother had not  slept, but in the morning twilight ofthis day she sunk from weariness into a deep  sleep; in the mean timethe coffin was carried into a distant room, and there nailed  down,that she might not hear the blows of the hammer.\"\\nWhen she awoke, andwanted to  see her child, the husband, with tears, said, \"We haveclosed the coffin; it was  necessary to do so.\"\\n  \"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?\"\\nshe said with groans  and tears.\"\\n The coffin was carried to the grave, and the disconsolate mothersat with her young  daughters.\"\\nShe looked at them, but she saw themnot; for her thoughts were far away  from the domestic hearth.\"\\nShe gaveherself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and  fro, as the seatosses a ship without compass or rudder.\"\\nSo the day of the funeralpassed  away, and similar days followed, of dark, wearisome pain.With tearful eyes and  mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters andthe afflicted husband looked upon her  who would not hear their wordsof comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could  they speak,when they were themselves so full of grief?\"\\nIt seemed as if shewould never  again know sleep, and yet it would have been her bestfriend, one who would have  strengthened her body and poured peace intoher soul.\"\\nThey at last persuaded her to  lie down, and then she wouldlie as still as if she slept.\"\\n One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to herbreathing, he quite  believed that she had at length found rest andrelief in sleep.\"\\nHe folded his arms  and prayed, and soon sunkhimself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice  that hiswife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from thehouse, to go  where her thoughts constantly lingered- to the grave ofher child.\"\\nShe passed through  the garden, to a path across a fieldthat led to the churchyard.\"\\nNo one saw her as  she walked, nor didshe see any one; for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of  herwanderings.\"\\nIt was a lovely starlight night in the beginning ofSeptember, and the  air was mild and still.\"\\nShe entered thechurchyard, and stood by the little grave,  which looked like a largenosegay of fragrant flowers.\"\\nShe sat down, and bent her head  low overthe grave, as if she could see her child through the earth thatcovered him\\ufffeher little boy, whose smile was so vividly before her,and the gentle expression of  whose eyes, even on his sick-bed, shecould not forget.\"\\nHow full of meaning that glance  had been, as sheleaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no  longerstrength to raise!\"\\nAs she had sat by his little cot, so now she satby his grave;  and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell uponit.\"\\n \"Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child,\" said avoice quite close to her,-  a voice that sounded so deep and clear,that it went to her heart.\"\\n She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a blackcloak, with a hood closely  drawn over his face; but her keen glancecould distinguish the face under the hood.\"\\n It was stern, yetawakened confidence, and the eyes beamed with youthful radiance.\"\\n \"Down to my child,\" she repeated; and tones of despair andentreaty sounded in the  words.\"\\n \"Darest thou to follow me?\"\\n asked the form.\"\\n\"I am Death.\"\\n  She bowed her head in token of assent.\"\\nThen suddenly it appearedas if all the stars  were shining with the radiance of the full moon onthe many-colored flowers that decked  the grave.\"\\nThe earth that coveredit was drawn back like a floating drapery.\"\\nShe sunk  down, and thespectre covered her with a black cloak; night closed around her, thenight  of death.\"\\nShe sank deeper than the spade of the sexton couldpenetrate, till the  churchyard became a roof above her.\"\\nThen the cloakwas removed, and she found herself  in a large hall, ofwide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a subdued light,  liketwilight, reigning, and in a moment her child appeared before her,smiling, and  more beautiful than ever; with a silent cry she pressedhim to her heart.\"\\nA glorious  strain of music sounded- now distant, nownear.\"\\nNever had she listened to such tones  as these; they came frombeyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of  deathfrom the land of eternity.\"\\n \"My sweet, darling mother,\" she heard the child say.\"\\nIt was thewell-known, beloved  voice; and kiss followed kiss, in boundlessdelight.\"\\nThen the child pointed to the  dark curtain.\"\\n\"There is nothingso beautiful on earth as it is here.\"\\nMother, do you  not see themall?\"\\nOh, it is happiness indeed.\"\\n  But the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out, only thedark curtain.\"\\nShe  looked with earthly eyes, and could not see as thechild saw,- he whom God has called  to be with Himself.\"\\nShe couldhear the sounds of music, but she heard not the words,  the Word inwhich she was to trust.\"\\n \"I can fly now, mother,\" said the child; \"I can fly with otherhappy children into  the presence of the Almighty.\"\\nI would fain flyaway now; but if you weep for me as  you are weeping now, you may neversee me again.\"\\nAnd yet I would go so gladly.\"\\nMay  I not fly away?\"\\nAndyou will come to me soon, will you not, dear mother?\"\\n  \"Oh, stay, stay!\"\\n implored the mother; \"only one moment more; onlyonce more, that  I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press thee tomy heart.\"\\n  Then she kissed and fondled her child.\"\\nSuddenly her name wascalled from above; what  could it mean?\"\\nher name uttered in a plaintivevoice.\"\\n \"Hearest thou?\"\\n said the child.\"\\n\"It is my father who callsthee.\"\\n And in a few moments  deep sighs were heard, as of childrenweeping.\"\\n\"They are my sisters,\" said the child.\"\\n \"Mother, surely youhave not forgotten them.\"\\n  And then she remembered those she left behind, and a greatterror came over her.\"\\nShe  looked around her at the dark night.\"\\nDimforms flitted by.\"\\nShe seemed to recognize  some of them, as theyfloated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain,  wherethey vanished.\"\\nWould her husband and her daughters flit past?\"\\nNo;their sighs  and lamentations still sounded from above; and she hadnearly forgotten them, for the  sake of him who was dead.\"\\n \"Mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing,\" said the child;\"mother, the sun is  going to rise.\"\\n  An overpowering light streamed in upon her, the child hadvanished, and she was being  borne upwards.\"\\nAll around her became cold;she lifted her head, and saw that she was  lying in the churchyard,on the grave of her child.\"\\nThe Lord, in a dream, had been  a guide toher feet and a light to her spirit.\"\\nShe bowed her knees, and prayedfor  forgiveness.\"\\nShe had wished to keep back a soul from itsimmortal flight; she had  forgotten her duties towards the living whowere left her.\"\\nAnd when she had offered  this prayer, her heart feltlighter.\"\\nThe sun burst forth, over her head a little bird  carolled hissong, and the church-bells sounded for the early service.\"\\n Everythingaround her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened.\"\\nSheacknowledged the  goodness of God, she acknowledged the duties shehad to perform, and eagerly she  returned home.\"\\nShe bent over herhusband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss  awakened him, andwords of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both.\"\\nNow she was  gentleand strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words offaith: \"Whatever  He doeth is right and best.\"\\n  Then her husband asked, \"From whence hast thou all at once derivedsuch strength and  comforting faith?\"\\n  And as she kissed him and her children, she said, \"It came fromGod, through my child  in the grave.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE CONCEITED APPLE-BRANCH  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT was the month of May.\"\\nThe wind still blew cold; but from bushand tree, field and  flower, came the welcome sound, \"Spring iscome.\"\\n Wild-flowers in profusion covered  the hedges.\"\\nUnder thelittle apple-tree, Spring seemed busy, and told his tale from  one ofthe branches which hung fresh and blooming, and covered withdelicate pink  blossoms that were just ready to open.\"\\nThe branch wellknew how beautiful it was; this  knowledge exists as much in the leafas in the blood; I was therefore not surprised  when a nobleman\\'scarriage, in which sat the young countess, stopped in the road justby.\"\\n She said that an apple-branch was a most lovely object, and anemblem of spring in  its most charming aspect.\"\\nThen the branch wasbroken off for her, and she held it in  her delicate hand, andsheltered it with her silk parasol.\"\\nThen they drove to the  castle,in which were lofty halls and splendid drawing-rooms.\"\\nPure whitecurtains  fluttered before the open windows, and beautiful flowersstood in shining, transparent  vases; and in one of them, whichlooked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow,  theapple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light twigs of beech.\"\\nItwas a charming  sight.\"\\nThen the branch became proud, which was verymuch like human nature.\"\\n People of every description entered the room, and, according totheir position in  society, so dared they to express theiradmiration.\"\\nSome few said nothing, others  expressed too much, andthe apple-branch very soon got to understand that there was  as muchdifference in the characters of human beings as in those of plants andflowers.\"\\n Some are all for pomp and parade, others have a great deal todo to maintain their  own importance, while the rest might be sparedwithout much loss to society.\"\\nSo thought  the apple-branch, as he stoodbefore the open window, from which he could see out over  gardens andfields, where there were flowers and plants enough for him to thinkand  reflect upon; some rich and beautiful, some poor and humbleindeed.\"\\n \"Poor, despised herbs,\" said the apple-branch; \"there is reallya difference between  them and such as I am.\"\\nHow unhappy they mustbe, if they can feel as those in my position  do!\"\\nThere is a differenceindeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be equals.\"\\n  And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them,especially on a certain  little flower that is found in fields and inditches.\"\\nNo one bound these flowers  together in a nosegay; they weretoo common; they were even known to grow between the  paving-stones,shooting up everywhere, like bad weeds; and they bore the very uglyname  of \"dog-flowers\" or \"dandelions.\"\\n  \"Poor, despised plants,\" said the apple-bough, \"it is not yourfault that you are so  ugly, and that you have such an ugly name; butit is with plants as with men,- there  must be a difference.\"\\n  \"A difference!\"\\n cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the bloomingapple-branch, and then  kissed the yellow dandelion out in thefields.\"\\nAll were brothers, and the sunbeam  kissed them- the poorflowers as well as the rich.\"\\n The apple-bough had never thought of the boundless love of God,which extends over  all the works of creation, over everything whichlives, and moves, and has its being  in Him; he had never thought ofthe good and beautiful which are so often hidden, but  can never remainforgotten by Him,- not only among the lower creation, but also  amongmen.\"\\nThe sunbeam, the ray of light, knew better.\"\\n \"You do not see very far, nor very clearly,\" he said to theapple-branch.\"\\n\"Which is  the despised plant you so specially pity?\"\\n  \"The dandelion,\" he replied.\"\\n\"No one ever places it in anosegay; it is often trodden  under foot, there are so many of them;and when they run to seed, they have flowers  like wool, which fly awayin little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses  of thepeople.\"\\nThey are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds.\"\\nO, Iam really  very thankful that I was not made like one of theseflowers.\"\\n  There came presently across the fields a whole group ofchildren, the youngest of whom  was so small that it had to becarried by the others; and when he was seated on the  grass, amongthe yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his littlelegs,  rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them inchildlike innocence.\"\\nThe  elder children broke off the flowers withlong stems, bent the stalks one round the  other, to form links, andmade first a chain for the neck, then one to go across  theshoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wearround the head,  so that they looked quite splendid in their garlandsof green stems and golden flowers.\"\\n But the eldest among themgathered carefully the faded flowers, on the stem of which  was groupedtogether the seed, in the form of a white feathery coronal.\"\\nTheseloose,  airy wool-flowers are very beautiful, and look like finesnowy feathers or down.\"\\nThe  children held them to their mouths, andtried to blow away the whole coronal with one  puff of the breath.\"\\nTheyhad been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so would  be sureto have new clothes before the end of the year.\"\\nThe despised flowerwas by this  raised to the position of a prophet or foreteller ofevents.\"\\n \"Do you see,\" said the sunbeam, \"do you see the beauty of theseflowers?\"\\ndo you see  their powers of giving pleasure?\"\\n  \"Yes, to children,\" said the apple-bough.\"\\n By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a bluntknife without a handle,  began to dig round the roots of some of thedandelion-plants, and pull them up.\"\\nWith  some of these she intended tomake tea for herself; but the rest she was going to sell  to thechemist, and obtain some money.\"\\n \"But beauty is of higher value than all this,\" said the apple-treebranch; \"only the  chosen ones can be admitted into the realms of thebeautiful.\"\\nThere is a difference  between plants, just as there is adifference between men.\"\\n  Then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of God, as seen increation, and over  all that lives, and of the equal distribution ofHis gifts, both in time and in  eternity.\"\\n \"That is your opinion,\" said the apple-bough.\"\\n Then some people came into the room, and, among them, the youngcountess,- the lady  who had placed the apple-bough in thetransparent vase, so pleasantly beneath the rays  of the sunlight.She carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower.\"\\nTheobject  was hidden by two or three great leaves, which covered itlike a shield, so that no  draught or gust of wind could injure it, andit was carried more carefully than the  apple-branch had ever been.Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there  appearedthe feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion.\"\\nThis was what thelady had  so carefully plucked, and carried home so safely covered,so that not one of the  delicate feathery arrows of which its mist-likeshape was so lightly formed, should  flutter away.\"\\nShe now drew itforth quite uninjured, and wondered at its beautiful  form, and airylightness, and singular construction, so soon to be blown away bythe  wind.\"\\n \"See,\" she exclaimed, \"how wonderfully God has made this littleflower.\"\\nI will paint  it with the apple-branch together.\"\\nEvery oneadmires the beauty of the apple-bough;  but this humble flower has beenendowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness;  and although theydiffer in appearance, both are the children of the realms of beauty.\"\\n  Then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower, and he kissed theblooming apple-branch,  upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE DAISY  by Hans Christian Andersen  Now listen!\"\\nIn the country, close by the high road, stood afarmhouse; perhaps you  have passed by and seen it yourself.\"\\nTherewas a little flower garden with painted  wooden palings in front of it;close by was a ditch, on its fresh green bank grew a  little daisy; thesun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificentgarden  flowers, and therefore it thrived well.\"\\nOne morning it hadquite opened, and its little  snow-white petals stood round theyellow centre, like the rays of the sun.\"\\nIt did not  mind that nobodysaw it in the grass, and that it was a poor despised flower; on  thecontrary, it was quite happy, and turned towards the sun, lookingupward and  listening to the song of the lark high up in the air.\"\\n The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a greatholiday, but it was only  Monday.\"\\nAll the children were at school,and while they were sitting on the forms and  learning their lessons,it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and  from itssurroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the song of thelittle lark  expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings.\"\\nWitha sort of reverence the  daisy looked up to the bird that could fly andsing, but it did not feel envious.\"\\n\"I  can see and hear,\" it thought;\"the sun shines upon me, and the forest kisses me.\"\\nHow  rich I am!\"\\n  In the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers,and, strange to say,  the less fragrance they had the haughtier andprouder they were.\"\\nThe peonies puffed  themselves up in order to belarger than the roses, but size is not everything!\"\\nThe  tulips hadthe finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for they were standingbolt  upright like candles, that one might see them the better.\"\\nIntheir pride they did not  see the little daisy, which looked over tothem and thought, \"How rich and beautiful  they are!\"\\nI am sure thepretty bird will fly down and call upon them.\"\\nThank God, that  Istand so near and can at least see all the splendour.\"\\n And while thedaisy was still  thinking, the lark came flying down, crying \"Tweet,\"but not to the peonies and tulips\\ufffeno, into the grass to the poordaisy.\"\\nIts joy was so great that it did not know what  to think.\"\\nThelittle bird hopped round it and sang, \"How beautifully soft thegrass  is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart andsilver dress is growing  here.\"\\n The yellow centre in the daisy didindeed look like gold, while the little petals  shone as brightly assilver.\"\\n How happy the daisy was!\"\\nNo one has the least idea.\"\\nThe birdkissed it with its beak,  sang to it, and then rose again up to theblue sky.\"\\nIt was certainly more than a quarter  of an hour before thedaisy recovered its senses.\"\\nHalf ashamed, yet glad at heart,  it lookedover to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed  itspleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understoodits joy.\"\\nBut the  tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces werepointed and red, because they  were vexed.\"\\nThe peonies were sulky; itwas well that they could not speak, otherwise  they would have giventhe daisy a good lecture.\"\\nThe little flower could very well see  thatthey were ill at ease, and pitied them sincerely.\"\\n Shortly after this a girl came into the garden, with a large sharpknife.\"\\nShe went  to the tulips and began cutting them off, one afteranother.\"\\n\"Ugh!\"\\n sighed the daisy,  \"that is terrible; now they are donefor.\"\\n  The girl carried the tulips away.\"\\nThe daisy was glad that it wasoutside, and only  a small flower- it felt very grateful.\"\\nAt sunsetit folded its petals, and fell asleep,  and dreamt all night of the sunand the little bird.\"\\n On the following morning, when the flower once more stretchedforth its tender petals,  like little arms, towards the air andlight, the daisy recognised the bird\\'s voice,  but what it sang soundedso sad.\"\\nIndeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for  it hadbeen caught and put into a cage close by the open window.\"\\nIt sang ofthe happy  days when it could merrily fly about, of fresh green corn inthe fields, and of the  time when it could soar almost up to theclouds.\"\\nThe poor lark was most unhappy as  a prisoner in a cage.\"\\nThelittle daisy would have liked so much to help it, but what  could bedone?\"\\nIndeed, that was very difficult for such a small flower tofind out.\"\\n It entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was,how warmly the sun was  shining, and how splendidly white its ownpetals were.\"\\nIt could only think of the poor  captive bird, for whichit could do nothing.\"\\nThen two little boys came out of the  garden;one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the girl hadcut the  tulips.\"\\nThey came straight towards the little daisy, whichcould not understand what  they wanted.\"\\n \"Here is a fine piece of turf for the lark,\" said one of the boys,and began to cut  out a square round the daisy, so that it remainedin the centre of the grass.\"\\n \"Pluck the flower off\" said the other boy, and the daisytrembled for fear, for to  be pulled off meant death to it; and itwished so much to live, as it was to go with  the square of turf intothe poor captive lark\\'s cage.\"\\n \"No let it stay,\" said the other boy, \"it looks so pretty\".\"\\n And so it stayed, and was brought into the lark\\'s cage.\"\\nThe poorbird was lamenting  its lost liberty, and beating its wings against thewires; and the little daisy could  not speak or utter a consoling word,much as it would have liked to do so.\"\\nSo the  forenoon passed.\"\\n \"I have no water,\" said the captive lark, \"they have all gone out,and forgotten to  give me anything to drink.\"\\nMy throat is dry andburning.\"\\nI feel as if I had fire and  ice within me, and the air isso oppressive.\"\\nAlas!\"\\nI must die, and part with the warm  sunshine,the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has created.\"\\n Andit  thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to refresh itself alittle.\"\\nThen it noticed  the little daisy, and nodded to it, and kissedit with its beak and said: \"You must  also fade in here, poor littleflower.\"\\nYou and the piece of grass are all they have  given me inexchange for the whole world, which I enjoyed outside.\"\\nEach littleblade  of grass shall be a green tree for me, each of your white petalsa fragrant flower.\"\\n Alas!\"\\nyou only remind me of what I have lost.\"\\n  \"I wish I could console the poor lark,\" thought the daisy.\"\\nItcould not move one of  its leaves, but the fragrance of its delicatepetals streamed forth, and was much  stronger than such flowers usuallyhave: the bird noticed it, although it was dying  with thirst, and inits pain tore up the green blades of grass, but did not touch  theflower.\"\\n The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird adrop of water; it opened  its beautiful wings, and fluttered about inits anguish; a faint and mournful \"Tweet,  tweet,\" was all it couldutter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and  itsheart broke for want and longing.\"\\nThe flower could not, as on theprevious evening,  fold up its petals and sleep; it droppedsorrowfully.\"\\nThe boys only came the next  morning; when they saw thedead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave  for it, andadorned it with flowers.\"\\nThe bird\\'s body was placed in a pretty redbox;  they wished to bury it with royal honours.\"\\nWhile it was alive andsang they forgot  it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now, theycried over it and covered it with  flowers.\"\\nThe piece of turf, with thelittle daisy in it, was thrown out on the dusty  highway.\"\\nNobodythought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird and had  sogreatly desired to comfort it.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE DARNING-NEEDLE  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a darning-needle who thought herself so fine thatshe fancied she must  be fit for embroidery.\"\\n\"Hold me tight,\" she wouldsay to the fingers, when they took  her up, \"don\\'t let me fall; ifyou do I shall never be found again, I am so very fine.\"\\n  \"That is your opinion, is it?\"\\n said the fingers, as they seizedher round the body.\"\\n \"See, I am coming with a train,\" said the darning-needle,drawing a long thread after  her; but there was no knot in the thread.\"\\n The fingers then placed the point of the needle against the cook\\'sslipper.\"\\nThere was  a crack in the upper leather, which had to besewn together.\"\\n \"What coarse work!\"\\n said the darning-needle, \"I shall never getthrough.\"\\nI shall  break!- I am breaking!\"\\n and sure enough she broke.\"\\nDid I not say so?\"\\n said the  darning-needle, \"I know I am too fine forsuch work as that.\"\\n  \"This needle is quite useless for sewing now,\" said the fingers;but they still held  it fast, and the cook dropped some sealing-waxon the needle, and fastened her  handkerchief with it in front.\"\\n \"So now I am a breast-pin,\" said the darning-needle; \"I knewvery well I should come  to honor some day: merit is sure to rise;\" andshe laughed, quietly to herself, for  of course no one ever saw adarning-needle laugh.\"\\nAnd there she sat as proudly as if  she were in astate coach, and looked all around her.\"\\n\"May I be allowed to ask ifyou  are made of gold?\"\\n she inquired of her neighbor, a pin; \"youhave a very pretty  appearance, and a curious head, although you arerather small.\"\\nYou must take pains  to grow, for it is not every one whohas sealing-wax dropped upon him;\" and as she  spoke, thedarning-needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of  thehandkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was cleaning.\"\\n\"NowI am going on  a journey,\" said the needle, as she floated away withthe dirty water, \"I do hope I  shall not be lost.\"\\n But she really waslost in a gutter.\"\\n\"I am too fine for this world,\"  said thedarning-needle, as she lay in the gutter; \"but I know who I am, andthat is  always some comfort.\"\\n So the darning-needle kept up herproud behavior, and did not  lose her good humor.\"\\nThen there floatedover her all sorts of things,- chips and straws,  and pieces of oldnewspaper.\"\\n\"See how they sail,\" said the darning-needle; \"they donot  know what is under them.\"\\nI am here, and here I shall stick.\"\\nSee,there goes a chip,  thinking of nothing in the world but himself-only a chip.\"\\nThere\\'s a straw going by  now; how he turns and twistsabout!\"\\nDon\\'t be thinking too much of yourself, or you  may chance torun against a stone.\"\\nThere swims a piece of newspaper; what is writtenupon  it has been forgotten long ago, and yet it gives itself airs.\"\\nIsit here patiently  and quietly.\"\\nI know who I am, so I shall not move.\"\\n  One day something lying close to the darning-needle glittered sosplendidly that she  thought it was a diamond; yet it was only apiece of broken bottle.\"\\nThe darning-needle  spoke to it, because itsparkled, and represented herself as a breast-pin.\"\\n\"I suppose  youare really a diamond?\"\\n she said.\"\\n \"Why yes, something of the kind,\" he replied; and so each believedthe other to be  very valuable, and then they began to talk about theworld, and the conceited people  in it.\"\\n \"I have been in a lady\\'s work-box,\" said the darning-needle,\"and this lady was the  cook.\"\\nShe had on each hand five fingers, andanything so conceited as these five fingers  I have never seen; and yetthey were only employed to take me out of the box and to  put me backagain.\"\\n  \"Were they not high-born?\"\\n  \"High-born!\"\\n said the darning-needle, \"no indeed, but sohaughty.\"\\nThey were five  brothers, all born fingers; they kept veryproudly together, though they were of  different lengths.\"\\nThe one whostood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was  short and thick,and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but onebow;  but he said that if he were cut off from a man\\'s hand, that manwould be unfit for  a soldier.\"\\nSweet-tooth, his neighbor, dippedhimself into sweet or sour, pointed to  the sun and moon, and formedthe letters when the fingers wrote.\"\\nLongman, the middle  finger, lookedover the heads of all the others.\"\\nGold-band, the next finger, wore  agolden circle round his waist.\"\\nAnd little Playman did nothing atall, and seemed proud  of it.\"\\nThey were boasters, and boasters theywill remain; and therefore I left them.\"\\n  \"And now we sit here and glitter,\" said the piece of brokenbottle.\"\\n At the same moment more water streamed into the gutter, so that itoverflowed, and  the piece of bottle was carried away.\"\\n \"So he is promoted,\" said the darning-needle, \"while I remainhere; I am too fine,  but that is my pride, and what do I care?\"\\n And soshe sat there in her pride, and had  many such thoughts as these,- \"Icould almost fancy that I came from a sunbeam, I am  so fine.\"\\nItseems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water.Ah!\"\\n I am so fine that even my mother cannot find me.\"\\nHad I still myold eye, which was  broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, Iwould not do that, it is not genteel  to cry.\"\\n  One day a couple of street boys were paddling in the gutter, forthey sometimes found  old nails, farthings, and other treasures.\"\\nIt wasdirty work, but they took great  pleasure in it.\"\\n\"Hallo!\"\\n cried one, ashe pricked himself with the darning-needle,  \"here\\'s a fellow for you.\"\\n  \"I am not a fellow, I am a young lady,\" said the darning-needle;but no one heard her.\"\\n The sealing-wax had come off, and she was quite black; but blackmakes a person look  slender, so she thought herself even finer thanbefore.\"\\n \"Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,\" said one of the boys;so they stuck the  darning-needle into the egg-shell.\"\\n \"White walls, and I am black myself,\" said the darning-needle,\"that looks well; now  I can be seen, but I hope I shall not besea-sick, or I shall break again.\"\\n She was  not sea-sick, and she didnot break.\"\\n\"It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have  a steelstomach, and not to forget one\\'s own importance.\"\\nNow my sea-sicknesshas past:  delicate people can bear a great deal.\"\\n  Crack went the egg-shell, as a waggon passed over it.\"\\n\"Goodheavens, how it crushes!\"\\n  said the darning-needle.\"\\n\"I shall be sicknow.\"\\nI am breaking!\"\\n but she did not break,  though the waggon wentover her as she lay at full length; and there let her lie.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE DROP OF WATER  by Hans Christian Andersen  OF course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass- one ofthose round  spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundredtimes bigger than it is?\"\\nWhen  any one takes one of these and holdsit to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from  the pond yonder, hesees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise  neverdiscerned in the water.\"\\nBut there they are, and it is no delusion.It almost looks  like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in acrowd.\"\\nAnd how fierce they are!\"\\n They tear off each other\\'s legs.\"\\nandarms and bodies, before and behind;

and he poured  something like a little drop of red wine into thedrop of water, but it was witches\\'  blood from the lobes of the ear,the finest kind, at ninepence a drop.\"\\nAnd now the  wonderful littlecreatures were pink all over.\"\\nIt looked like a whole town of nakedwild  men.\"\\n \"What have you there?\"\\n asked another old magician, who had noname- and that was the  best thing about him.\"\\n \"Yes, if you can guess what it is,\" said Kribble-Krabble, \"I\\'llmake you a present  of it.\"\\n  But it is not so easy to find out if one does not know.\"\\n And the magician who had no name looked through themagnifying-glass.\"\\n It looked really like a great town reflected there, in which allthe people were running  about without clothes.\"\\nIt was terrible!\"\\nBut itwas still more terrible to see how one  beat and pushed the other,and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him.\"\\nThose at  the top werebeing pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling upwards.\"\\n \"Look!\"\\nlook!\"\\nhis leg is longer than mine!\"\\nBah!\"\\nAway with it!\"\\nThereis one who has a  little bruise.\"\\nIt hurts him, but it shall hurt himstill more.\"\\n  And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate himup, because of the  little bruise.\"\\nAnd there was one sitting as stillas any little maiden, and wishing  only for peace and quietness.\"\\nButnow she had to come out, and they tugged at her,  and pulled her about,and ate her up.\"\\n \"That\\'s funny!\"\\n said the magician.\"\\n \"Yes; but what do you think it is?\"\\n said Kribble-Krabble.\"\\n\"Can youfind that out?\"\\n  \"Why, one can see that easily enough,\" said the other.\"\\n\"That\\'s Paris,or some other  great city, for they\\'re all alike.\"\\nIt\\'s a great city!\"\\n  \"It\\'s a drop of puddle water!\"\\n said Kribble-Krabble.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE DRYAD  by Hans Christian Andersen  WE are travelling to Paris to the Exhibition.\"\\n Now we are there.\"\\nThat was a journey, a flight without magic.\"\\nWeflew on the wings  of steam over the sea and across the land.\"\\n Yes, our time is the time of fairy tales.\"\\n We are in the midst of Paris, in a great hotel.\"\\nBlooming flowersornament the staircases,  and soft carpets the floors.\"\\n Our room is a very cosy one, and through the open balcony doorwe have a view of a  great square.\"\\nSpring lives down there; it has cometo Paris, and arrived at the same  time with us.\"\\nIt has come in theshape of a glorious young chestnut tree, with delicate  leaves newlyopened.\"\\nHow the tree gleams, dressed in its spring garb, before allthe  other trees in the place!\"\\nOne of these latter had been struckout of the list of living  trees.\"\\nIt lies on the ground with rootsexposed.\"\\nOn the place where it stood, the young  chestnut tree is to beplanted, and to flourish.\"\\n It still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which hasbrought it this morning  a distance of several miles to Paris.\"\\nForyears it had stood there, in the protection  of a mighty oak tree,under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat, with  childrenlistening to his stories.\"\\n The young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories; forthe Dryad who lived in  it was a child also.\"\\nShe remembered the timewhen the tree was so little that it only  projected a short way abovethe grass and ferns around.\"\\nThese were as tall as they  would everbe; but the tree grew every year, and enjoyed the air and thesunshine, and  drank the dew and the rain.\"\\nSeveral times it was also,as it must be, well shaken by  the wind and the rain; for that is apart of education.\"\\n The Dryad rejoiced in her life, and rejoiced in the sunshine,and the singing of the  birds; but she was most rejoiced at humanvoices; she understood the language of men  as well as she understoodthat of animals.\"\\n Butterflies, cockchafers, dragon-flies, everything that couldfly came to pay a visit.\"\\n They could all talk.\"\\nThey told of thevillage, of the vineyard, of the forest, of the  old castle with itsparks and canals and ponds.\"\\nDown in the water dwelt also  livingbeings, which, in their way, could fly under the water from oneplace to another\\ufffebeings with knowledge and delineation.\"\\nThey saidnothing at all; they were so clever!\"\\n And the swallow, who had dived, told about the pretty littlegoldfish, of the thick  turbot, the fat brill, and the old carp.\"\\nTheswallow could describe all that very well,  but, \"Self is the man,\" shesaid.\"\\n\"One ought to see these things one\\'s self.\"\\n But how  was theDryad ever to see such beings?\"\\nShe was obliged to be satisfied withbeing able  to look over the beautiful country and see the busyindustry of men.\"\\n It was glorious; but most glorious of all when the old clergymansat under the oak  tree and talked of France, and of the great deeds ofher sons and daughters, whose  names will be mentioned withadmiration through all time.\"\\n Then the Dryad heard of the shepherd girl, Joan of Arc, and ofCharlotte Corday; she  heard about Henry the Fourth, and Napoleon theFirst; she heard names whose echo sounds  in the hearts of the people.\"\\n The village children listened attentively, and the Dryad no lessattentively; she  became a school-child with the rest.\"\\nIn the cloudsthat went sailing by she saw, picture  by picture, everything thatshe heard talked about.\"\\nThe cloudy sky was her  picture-book.\"\\n She felt so happy in beautiful France, the fruitful land ofgenius, with the crater  of freedom.\"\\nBut in her heart the stingremained that the bird, that every animal that  could fly, was muchbetter off than she.\"\\nEven the fly could look about more in theworld,  far beyond the Dryad\\'s horizon.\"\\n France was so great and so glorious, but she could only lookacross a little piece  of it.\"\\nThe land stretched out, world-wide,with vineyards, forests and great cities.\"\\n Of all these Paris was themost splendid and the mightiest.\"\\nThe birds could get there;  but she,never!\"\\n Among the village children was a little ragged, poor girl, but apretty one to look  at.\"\\nShe was always laughing or singing andtwining red flowers in her black hair.\"\\n \"Don\\'t go to Paris!\"\\n the old clergyman warned her.\"\\n\"Poor child!\"\\nifyou go there, it  will be your ruin.\"\\n  But she went for all that.\"\\n The Dryad often thought of her; for she had the same wish, andfelt the same longing  for the great city.\"\\n The Dryad\\'s tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms; thebirds were twittering  round them in the most beautiful sunshine.Then a stately carriage came rolling along  that way, and in it sat agrand lady driving the spirited, light-footed horses.\"\\nOn  the back seata little smart groom balanced himself.\"\\nThe Dryad knew the lady, andthe  old clergyman knew her also.\"\\nHe shook his head gravely when he sawher, and said:  \"So you went there after all, and it was your ruin, poor Mary!\"\\n  \"That one poor?\"\\n thought the Dryad.\"\\n\"No; she wears a dress fit fora countess\" (she  had become one in the city of magic changes).\"\\n\"Oh, ifI were only there, amid all the  splendor and pomp!\"\\nThey shine upinto the very clouds at night; when I look up, I can  tell in whatdirection the town lies.\"\\n  Towards that direction the Dryad looked every evening.\"\\nShe sawin the dark night the  gleaming cloud on the horizon; in the clearmoonlight nights she missed the sailing  clouds, which showed herpictures of the city and pictures from history.\"\\n The child grasps at the picture-books, the Dryad grasped at thecloud-world, her  thought-book.\"\\nA sudden, cloudless sky was for her ablank leaf; and for several days  she had only had such leaves beforeher.\"\\n It was in the warm summer-time: not a breeze moved through theglowing hot days.\"\\nEvery  leaf, every flower, lay as if it weretorpid, and the people seemed torpid, too.\"\\n Then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where thegleaming mist  announced \"Here lies Paris.\"\\n  The clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains,hurried on through the air,  and spread themselves abroad over thewhole landscape, as far as the Dryad\\'s eye could  reach.\"\\n Like enormous blue-black blocks of rock, the clouds lay piled overone another.\"\\nGleams  of lightning shot forth from them.\"\\n \"These also are the servants of the Lord God,\" the old clergymanhad said.\"\\nAnd there  came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning, alighting up as if of the sun itself, which  could burst blocks ofrock asunder.\"\\nThe lightning struck and split to the roots the  oldvenerable oak.\"\\nThe crown fell asunder.\"\\nIt seemed as if the tree werestretching  forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light.\"\\n No bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royalchild as the thunder  sounded at the death of the old oak.\"\\nThe rainstreamed down; a refreshing wind was  blowing; the storm had gone by,and there was quite a holiday glow on all things.\"\\nThe  old clergymanspoke a few words for honorable remembrance, and a painter made adrawing,  as a lasting record of the tree.\"\\n \"Everything passes away,\" said the Dryad, \"passes away like acloud, and never comes  back!\"\\n  The old clergyman, too, did not come back.\"\\nThe green roof of hisschool was gone, and  his teaching-chair had vanished.\"\\nThe children didnot come; but autumn came, and winter  came, and then spring also.\"\\nInall this change of seasons the Dryad looked toward the  region where,at night, Paris gleamed with its bright mist far on the horizon.\"\\n Forth from the town rushed engine after engine, train after train,whistling and  screaming at all hours in the day.\"\\nIn the evening,towards midnight, at daybreak, and  all the day through, came thetrains.\"\\nOut of each one, and into each one, streamed  people from thecountry of every king.\"\\nA new wonder of the world had summoned themto  Paris.\"\\n In what form did this wonder exhibit itself?\"\\n \"A splendid blossom of art and industry,\" said one, \"hasunfolded itself in the Champ  de Mars, a gigantic sunflower, from whosepetals one can learn geography and statistics,  and can become aswise as a lord mayor, and raise one\\'s self to the level of art  andpoetry, and study the greatness and power of the various lands.\"\\n  \"A fairy tale flower,\" said another, \"a many-coloredlotus-plant, which spreads out  its green leaves like a velvet carpetover the sand.\"\\nThe opening spring has brought  it forth, the summerwill see it in all its splendor, the autumn winds will sweep itaway,  so that not a leaf, not a fragment of its root shall remain.\"\\n  In front of the Military School extends in time of peace the arenaof war- a field  without a blade of grass, a piece of sandy steppe,as if cut out of the Desert of Africa,  where Fata Morgana displays herwondrous airy castles and hanging gardens.\"\\nIn the Champ  de Mars,however, these were to be seen more splendid, more wonderful than inthe East,  for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes intoreality.\"\\n \"The Aladdin\\'s Palace of the present has been built,\" it was said.\"\\nDay by day, hour  by hour, it unfolds more of its wonderful splendor.\"\\n  The endless halls shine in marble and many colors.\"\\n\"MasterBloodless\" here moves his  limbs of steel and iron in the greatcircular hall of machinery.\"\\nWorks of art in metal,  in stone, inGobelins tapestry, announce the vitality of mind that is stirring inevery  land.\"\\nHalls of paintings, splendor of flowers, everything thatmind and skill can  create in the workshop of the artisan, has beenplaced here for show.\"\\nEven the memorials  of ancient days, out of oldgraves and turf-moors, have appeared at this general  meeting.\"\\n The overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into smallportions, and  pressed together like a plaything, if it is to beunderstood and described.\"\\n Like a great table on Christmas Eve, the Champ de Mars carried awonder-castle of  industry and art, and around this knickknacks fromall countries had been ranged,  knickknacks on a grand scale, for everynation found some remembrance of home.\"\\n Here stood the royal palace of Egypt, there the caravanserai ofthe desert land.\"\\nThe  Bedouin had quitted his sunny country, andhastened by on his camel.\"\\nHere stood the  Russian stables, with thefiery glorious horses of the steppe.\"\\nHere stood the  simplestraw-thatched dwelling of the Danish peasant, with the Dannebrogflag, next  to Gustavus Vasa\\'s wooden house from Dalarne, with itswonderful carvings.\"\\nAmerican  huts, English cottages, French pavilions,kiosks, theatres, churches, all strewn  around, and between them thefresh green turf, the clear springing water, blooming  bushes, raretrees, hothouses, in which one might fancy one\\'s self transported intothe  tropical forest; whole gardens brought from Damascus, and bloomingunder one roof.\"\\n What colors, what fragrance!\"\\n Artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water,and gave a glimpse into  the empire of the fishes; the visitor seemedto wander at the bottom of the sea, among  fishes and polypi.\"\\n \"All this,\" they said, \"the Champ de Mars offers;\" and aroundthe great richly-spread  table the crowd of human beings moves like abusy swarm of ants, on foot or in little  carriages, for not all feetare equal to such a fatiguing journey.\"\\n Hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening.\"\\nSteamerafter steamer, crowded  with people, glides down the Seine.\"\\nThenumber of carriages is continually on the  increase.\"\\nThe swarm ofpeople on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense.\"\\n Carriagesand omnibuses are crowded, stuffed and embroidered with people.\"\\nAllthese  tributary streams flow in one direction- towards the Exhibition.On every entrance  the flag of France is displayed; around theworld\\'s bazaar wave the flags of all nations.\"\\n There is a humming and amurmuring from the hall of the machines; from the towers the  melody ofthe chimes is heard; with the tones of the organs in the churchesmingle the  hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the East.\"\\nIt is akingdom of Babel, a wonder of  the world!\"\\n In very truth it was.\"\\nThat\\'s what all the reports said, and whodid not hear them?\"\\n The Dryad knew everything that is told here ofthe new wonder in the city of cities.\"\\n \"Fly away, ye birds!\"\\nfly away to see, and then come back andtell me,\" said the Dryad.\"\\n The wish became an intense desire- became the one thought of alife.\"\\nThen, in the quiet  silent night, while the full moon wasshining, the Dryad saw a spark fly out of the  moon\\'s disc, and falllike a shooting star.\"\\nAnd before the tree, whose leaves waved  to andfro as if they were stirred by a tempest, stood a noble, mighty, andgrand figure.\"\\n In tones that were at once rich and strong, like thetrumpet of the Last Judgment  bidding farewell to life and summoning tothe great account, it said:  \"Thou shalt go to the city of magic; thou shalt take root there,and enjoy the mighty  rushing breezes, the air and the sunshinethere.\"\\nBut the time of thy life shall then  be shortened; the line ofyears that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink  tobut a small tale.\"\\nPoor Dryad!\"\\nIt shall be thy destruction.\"\\nThyyearning and longing  will increase, thy desire will grow morestormy, the tree itself will be as a prison  to thee, thou wilt quitthy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among  men.Then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contractedto half the  span of the ephemeral fly, that lives but a day: onenight, and thy life-taper shall  be blown out- the leaves of the treewill wither and be blown away, to become green  never again!\"\\n  Thus the words sounded.\"\\nAnd the light vanished away, but not thelonging of the Dryad.\"\\n She trembled in the wild fever of expectation.\"\\n \"I shall go there!\"\\n she cried, rejoicingly.\"\\n\"Life is beginning andswells like a cloud;  nobody knows whither it is hastening.\"\\n  When the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the cloudswere tinted red, the  wished-for hour struck.\"\\nThe words of promise werefulfilled.\"\\n People appeared with spades and poles; they dug round the roots ofthe tree, deeper  and deeper, and beneath it.\"\\nA wagon was broughtout, drawn by many horses, and the  tree was lifted up, with itsroots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them; matting  wasplaced around the roots, as though the tree had its feet in a warmbag.\"\\nAnd now  the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with chains.The journey began- the journey  to Paris.\"\\nThere the tree was to grow asan ornament to the city of French glory.\"\\n The twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in thefirst moments of its  being moved; and the Dryad trembled in thepleasurable feeling of expectation.\"\\n \"Away!\"\\naway!\"\\n it sounded in every beat of her pulse.\"\\n\"Away!away\" sounded in words  that flew trembling along.\"\\nThe Dryad forgotto bid farewell to the regions of home;  she thought not of thewaving grass and of the innocent daisies, which had looked up  to heras to a great lady, a young Princess playing at being a shepherdessout in the  open air.\"\\n The chestnut tree stood upon the wagon, and nodded his branches;whether this meant  \"farewell\" or \"forward,\" the Dryad knew not; shedreamed only of the marvellous new  things, that seemed yet sofamiliar, and that were to unfold themselves before her.\"\\n No child\\'sheart rejoicing in innocence- no heart whose blood danced withpassion- had  set out on the journey to Paris more full ofexpectation than she.\"\\n Her \"farewell\" sounded in the words \"Away!\"\\naway!\"\\n  The wheels turned; the distant approached; the present vanished.The region was  changed, even as the clouds change.\"\\nNew vineyards,forests, villages, villas appeared\\ufffecame nearer- vanished!\"\\n The chestnut tree moved forward, and the Dryad went with it.Steam-engine after  steam-engine rushed past, sending up into the airvapory clouds, that formed figures  which told of Paris, whence theycame, and whither the Dryad was going.\"\\n Everything around knew it, and must know whither she was bound.\"\\nItseemed to her as  if every tree she passed stretched out its leavestowards her, with the prayer- \"Take  me with you!\"\\ntake me with you!\"\\nfor every tree enclosed a longing Dryad.\"\\n What changes during this flight!\"\\nHouses seemed to be rising out ofthe earth- more  and more- thicker and thicker.\"\\nThe chimneys roselike flower-pots ranged side by side,  or in rows one above theother, on the roofs.\"\\nGreat inscriptions in letters a yard  long, andfigures in various colors, covering the walls from cornice tobasement, came  brightly out.\"\\n \"Where does Paris begin, and when shall I be there?\"\\n asked theDryad.\"\\n The crowd of people grew; the tumult and the bustle increased;carriage followed upon  carriage; people on foot and people onhorseback were mingled together; all around  were shops on shops, musicand song, crying and talking.\"\\n The Dryad, in her tree, was now in the midst of Paris.\"\\nThe greatheavy wagon all at  once stopped on a little square planted with trees.The high houses around had all  of them balconies to the windows,from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young  fresh chestnuttree, which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for the  deadtree that lay stretched on the ground.\"\\n The passers-by stood still and smiled in admiration of its purevernal freshness.\"\\nThe  older trees, whose buds were still closed,whispered with their waving branches,  \"Welcome!\"\\nwelcome!\"\\n Thefountain, throwing its jet of water high up in the air, to  let it fallagain in the wide stone basin, told the wind to sprinkle the new-comerwith  pearly drops, as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught towelcome him.\"\\n The Dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon tobe placed in the spot  where it was to stand.\"\\nThe roots were coveredwith earth, and fresh turf was laid on  top.\"\\nBlooming shrubs andflowers in pots were ranged around; and thus a little garden  arosein the square.\"\\n The tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas, the steam ofkitchens, and the bad  air of the city, was put upon the wagon anddriven away.\"\\nThe passers-by looked on.\"\\n Children and old men sat uponthe bench, and looked at the green tree.\"\\nAnd we who are  telling thisstory stood upon a balcony, and looked down upon the green springsight  that had been brought in from the fresh country air, and said,what the old clergyman  would have said, \"Poor Dryad!\"\\n  \"I am happy!\"\\nI am happy!\"\\n the Dryad cried, rejoicing; \"and yet Icannot realize, cannot  describe what I feel.\"\\nEverything is as Ifancied it, and yet as I did not fancy it.\"\\n  The houses stood there, so lofty, so close!\"\\nThe sunlight shoneon only one of the walls,  and that one was stuck over with bills andplacards, before which the people stood  still; and this made a crowd.\"\\n Carriages rushed past, carriages rolled past; light ones and heavyones mingled  together.\"\\nOmnibuses, those over-crowded moving houses,came rattling by; horsemen  galloped among them; even carts andwagons asserted their rights.\"\\n The Dryad asked herself if these high-grown houses, which stood soclose around her,  would not remove and take other shapes, like theclouds in the sky, and draw aside,  so that she might cast a glanceinto Paris, and over it.\"\\nNotre Dame must show itself,  the VendomeColumn, and the wondrous building which had called and was stillcalling  so many strangers to the city.\"\\n But the houses did not stir from their places.\"\\nIt was yet day whenthe lamps were lit.\"\\n The gas-jets gleamed from the shops, and shoneeven into the branches of the trees,  so that it was like sunlight insummer.\"\\nThe stars above made their appearance, the  same to which theDryad had looked up in her home.\"\\nShe thought she felt a clear  purestream of air which went forth from them.\"\\nShe felt herself lifted upand  strengthened, and felt an increased power of seeing throughevery leaf and through  every fibre of the root.\"\\nAmid all the noise andthe turmoil, the colors and the lights,  she knew herself watched bymild eyes.\"\\n From the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles andwind instruments.\"\\nUp!\"\\n to the dance, to the dance!\"\\nto jollity andpleasure!\"\\nthat was their invitation.\"\\nSuch  music it was, that horses,carriages, trees, and houses would have danced, if they  had known how.The charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the Dryad.\"\\n \"How glorious, how splendid it is!\"\\n she cried, rejoicingly.\"\\n\"Now Iam in Paris!\"\\n  The next day that dawned, the next night that fell, offered thesame spectacle, similar  bustle, similar life; changing, indeed, yetalways the same; and thus it went on  through the sequence of days.\"\\n \"Now I know every tree, every flower on the square here!\"\\nI knowevery house, every  balcony, every shop in this narrow cut-offcorner, where I am denied the sight of this  great mighty city.\"\\nWhereare the arches of triumph, the Boulevards, the wondrous  building ofthe world?\"\\nI see nothing of all this.\"\\nAs if shut up in a cage, I standamong  the high houses, which I now know by heart, with theirinscriptions, signs, and  placards; all the painted confectionery, thatis no longer to my taste.\"\\nWhere are all  the things of which I heard,for which I longed, and for whose sake I wanted to come  hither?\"\\nwhathave I seized, found, won?\"\\nI feel the same longing I felt before; Ifeel  that there is a life I should wish to grasp and to experience.I must go out into the  ranks of living men, and mingle among them.\"\\nImust fly about like a bird.\"\\nI must see  and feel, and become humanaltogether.\"\\nI must enjoy the one half-day, instead of  vegetating foryears in every-day sameness and weariness, in which I become ill,and  at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows.\"\\nI willgleam like the cloud,  gleam in the sunshine of life, look out over thewhole like the cloud, and pass away  like it, no one knoweth whither.\"\\n  Thus sighed the Dryad; and she prayed:  \"Take from me the years that were destined for me, and give me buthalf of the life  of the ephemeral fly!\"\\nDeliver me from my prison!\"\\nGiveme human life, human happiness,  only a short span, only the one night,if it cannot be otherwise; and then punish me  for my wish to live,my longing for life!\"\\nStrike me out of thy list.\"\\nLet my shell,  thefresh young tree, wither, or be hewn down, and burnt to ashes, andscattered to  all the winds!\"\\n  A rustling went through the leaves of the tree; there was atrembling in each of the  leaves; it seemed as if fire streamed throughit.\"\\nA gust of wind shook its green crown,  and from the midst of thatcrown a female figure came forth.\"\\nIn the same moment she  was sittingbeneath the brightly-illuminated leafy branches, young and beautifulto  behold, like poor Mary, to whom the clergyman had said, \"Thegreat city will be thy  destruction.\"\\n  The Dryad sat at the foot of the tree- at her house door, whichshe had locked, and  whose key had thrown away.\"\\nSo young!\"\\nso fair!The stars saw her, and blinked at her.\"\\n The gas-lamps saw her, andgleamed and beckoned to her.\"\\nHow delicate she was, and yet  howblooming!- a child, and yet a grown maiden!\"\\nHer dress was fine assilk, green as  the freshly-opened leaves on the crown of the tree;in her nut-brown hair clung a  half-opened chestnut blossom.\"\\nShe lookedlike the Goddess of Spring.\"\\n For one short minute she sat motionless; then she sprang up,and, light as a gazelle,  she hurried away.\"\\nShe ran and sprang like thereflection from the mirror that, carried  by the sunshine, is cast, nowhere, now there.\"\\nCould any one have followed her with  his eyes, hewould have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed,according  to the nature of the house or the place whose light happenedto shine upon her.\"\\n She reached the Boulevards.\"\\nHere a sea of light streamed forthfrom the gas-flames  of the lamps, the shops and the cafes.\"\\nHerestood in a row young and slender trees,  each of which concealed itsDryad, and gave shade from the artificial sunlight.\"\\nThe  whole vastpavement was one great festive hall, where covered tables stoodladen with  refreshments of all kinds, from champagne and Chartreusedown to coffee and beer.\"\\nHere  was an exhibition of flowers, statues,books, and colored stuffs.\"\\n From the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over theterrific stream  beyond the rows of trees.\"\\nYonder heaved a stream ofrolling carriages, cabriolets,  coaches, omnibuses, cabs, and amongthem riding gentlemen and marching troops.\"\\nTo  cross to the oppositeshore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb.\"\\n Nowlanterns shed their radiance abroad; now the gas had the upper hand;suddenly a  rocket rises!\"\\nWhence?\"\\nWhither?\"\\n Here are sounds of soft Italian melodies; yonder, Spanish songsare sung, accompanied  by the rattle of the castanets; but strongest ofall, and predominating over the rest,  the street-organ tunes of themoment, the exciting \"Can-Can\" music, which Orpheus  never knew, andwhich was never heard by the \"Belle Helene.\"\\n Even the barrow wastempted  to hop upon one of its wheels.\"\\n The Dryad danced, floated, flew, changing her color everymoment, like a humming-bird  in the sunshine; each house, with theworld belonging to it, gave her its own  reflections.\"\\n As the glowing lotus-flower, torn from its stem, is carried awayby the stream, so  the Dryad drifted along.\"\\nWhenever she paused, shewas another being, so that none was  able to follow her, to recognizeher, or to look more closely at her.\"\\n Like cloud-pictures, all things flew by her.\"\\nShe looked into athousand faces, but  not one was familiar to her; she saw not asingle form from home.\"\\nTwo bright eyes had  remained in her memory.\"\\nShethought of Mary, poor Mary, the ragged merry child, who  wore the redflowers in her black hair.\"\\nMary was now here, in the world-city,rich and  magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house ofthe old clergyman, and  past the tree of the Dryad, the old oak.\"\\n Here she was certainly living, in the deafening tumult.\"\\nPerhapsshe had just stepped  out of one of the gorgeous carriages inwaiting.\"\\nHandsome equipages, with coachmen  in gold braid and footmenin silken hose, drove up.\"\\nThe people who alighted from them  were allrichly-dressed ladies.\"\\nThey went through the opened gate, and ascendedthe  broad staircase that led to a building resting on marblepillars.\"\\nWas this building,  perhaps, the wonder of the world?\"\\nThereMary would certainly be found.\"\\n \"Sancta Maria!\"\\n resounded from the interior.\"\\nIncense floatedthrough the lofty painted  and gilded aisles, where a solemn twilightreigned.\"\\n It was the Church of the Madeleine.\"\\n Clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs, fashionedaccording to the latest  mode, the rich feminine world of Parisglided across the shining pavement.\"\\nThe crests  of the proprietors wereengraved on silver shields on the velvet-bound prayer-books,  andembroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered withBrussels lace.\"\\n A few of the ladies were kneeling in silent prayerbefore the altars; others resorted  to the confessionals.\"\\n Anxiety and fear took possession of the Dryad; she felt as ifshe had entered a place  where she had no right to be.\"\\nHere was theabode of silence, the hall of secrets.\"\\n Everything was said inwhispers, every word was a mystery.\"\\n The Dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk, like the womenof wealth and of high  birth around her.\"\\nHad, perhaps, every one ofthem a longing in her breast, like the  Dryad?\"\\n A deep, painful sigh was heard.\"\\nDid it escape from someconfessional in a distant corner,  or from the bosom of the Dryad?She drew the veil closer around her; she breathed  incense, and not thefresh air.\"\\nHere was not the abiding-place of her longing.\"\\n Away!\"\\naway- a hastening without rest.\"\\nThe ephemeral fly knowsnot repose, for her  existence is flight.\"\\n She was out again among the gas candelabra, by a magnificentfountain.\"\\n \"All its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocentblood that was spilt  here.\"\\n  Such were the words spoken.\"\\nStrangers stood around, carrying ona lively conversation,  such as no one would have dared to carry onin the gorgeous hall of secrets whence  the Dryad came.\"\\n A heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted.\"\\nShe did notunderstand why.\"\\nShe saw  an opening that led into the depths below.\"\\nThestrangers stepped down, leaving the  starlit air and the cheerfullife of the upper world behind them.\"\\n \"I am afraid,\" said one of the women who stood around, to herhusband, \"I cannot venture  to go down, nor do I care for the wondersdown yonder.\"\\nYou had better stay here with  me.\"\\n  \"Indeed, and travel home,\" said the man, \"and quit Paris withouthaving seen the most  wonderful thing of all- the real wonder of thepresent period, created by the power  and resolution of one man!\"\\n  \"I will not go down for all that,\" was the reply.\"\\n \"The wonder of the present time,\" it had been called.\"\\nThe Dryadhad heard and had  understood it.\"\\nThe goal of her ardent longing hadthus been reached, and here was the  entrance to it.\"\\nDown into thedepths below Paris?\"\\nShe had not thought of such a thing;  but now sheheard it said, and saw the strangers descending, and went after them.\"\\n The staircase was of cast iron, spiral, broad and easy.\"\\nBelowthere burned a lamp,  and farther down, another.\"\\nThey stood in alabyrinth of endless halls and arched  passages, all communicating witheach other.\"\\nAll the streets and lanes of Paris were  to be seen hereagain, as in a dim reflection.\"\\nThe names were painted up; and  every,house above had its number down here also, and struck its rootsunder the  macadamized quays of a broad canal, in which the muddy waterflowed onward.\"\\nOver it  the fresh streaming water was carried onarches; and quite at the top hung the tangled  net of gas-pipes andtelegraph-wires.\"\\n In the distance lamps gleamed, like a reflection from theworld-city above.\"\\nEvery now  and then a dull rumbling was heard.\"\\nThiscame from the heavy wagons rolling over the  entrance bridges.\"\\n Whither had the Dryad come?\"\\n You have, no doubt, heard of the CATACOMBS?\"\\nNow they are vanishingpoints in that new  underground world- that wonder of the presentday- the sewers of Paris.\"\\nThe Dryad was  there, and not in theworld\\'s Exhibition in the Champ de Mars.\"\\n She heard exclamations of wonder and admiration.\"\\n \"From here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousandsup yonder!\"\\nOur time  is the time of progress, with its manifoldblessings.\"\\n  Such was the opinion and the speech of men; but not of thosecreatures who had been  born here, and who built and dwelt here- of therats, namely, who were squeaking to  one another in the clefts of acrumbling wall, quite plainly, and in a way the Dryad  understood well.\"\\n A big old Father-Rat, with his tail bitten off, was relievinghis feelings in loud  squeaks; and his family gave their tribute ofconcurrence to every word he said:  \"I am disgusted with this man-mewing,\" he cried- \"with theseoutbursts of ignorance.\"\\n A fine magnificence, truly!\"\\nall made up of gasand petroleum!\"\\nI can\\'t eat such stuff  as that.\"\\nEverything here is sofine and bright now, that one\\'s ashamed of one\\'s self,  without exactlyknowing why.\"\\nAh, if we only lived in the days of tallow candles!\"\\nandit  does not lie so very far behind us.\"\\nThat was a romantic time, asone may say.\"\\n  \"What are you talking of there?\"\\n asked the Dryad.\"\\n\"I have neverseen you before.\"\\nWhat  is it you are talking about?\"\\n  \"Of the glorious days that are gone,\" said the Rat- \"of thehappy time of our  great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers.\"\\nThen itwas a great thing to get down here.\"\\n That was a rat\\'s nest quitedifferent from Paris.\"\\nMother Plague used to live here then;  she killedpeople, but never rats.\"\\nRobbers and smugglers could breathe freelyhere.\"\\n Here was the meeting-place of the most interesting personages,whom one now only gets  to see in the theatres where they actmelodrama, up above.\"\\nThe time of romance is gone  even in our rat\\'snest; and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in.\"\\n  Thus squeaked the Rat; he squeaked in honor of the old time,when Mother Plague was  still alive.\"\\n A carriage stopped, a kind of open omnibus, drawn by swift horses.The company mounted  and drove away along the Boulevard deSebastopol, that is to say, the underground  boulevard, over whichthe well-known crowded street of that name extended.\"\\n The carriage disappeared in the twilight; the Dryad disappeared,lifted to the  cheerful freshness above.\"\\nHere, and not below in thevaulted passages, filled with  heavy air, the wonder work must be foundwhich she was to seek in her short lifetime.\"\\n It must gleam brighterthan all the gas-flames, stronger than the moon that was  justgliding past.\"\\n Yes, certainly, she saw it yonder in the distance, it gleamedbefore her, and twinkled  and glittered like the evening star in thesky.\"\\n She saw a glittering portal open, that led to a little garden,where all was brightness  and dance music.\"\\nColored lamps surroundedlittle lakes, in which were water-plants  of colored metal, fromwhose flowers jets of water spurted up.\"\\nBeautiful weeping  willows,real products of spring, hung their fresh branches over these lakeslike a  fresh, green, transparent, and yet screening veil.\"\\nIn thebushes burnt an open fire,  throwing a red twilight over the quiet hutsof branches, into which the sounds of music  penetrated- an eartickling, intoxicating music, that sent the blood coursing through  theveins.\"\\n Beautiful girls in festive attire, with pleasant smiles on theirlips, and the light  spirit of youth in their hearts- \"Marys,\" withroses in their hair, but without  carriage and postilion- flitted toand fro in the wild dance.\"\\n Where were the heads, where the feet?\"\\nAs if stung by tarantulas,they sprang, laughed,  rejoiced, as if in their ecstacies they weregoing to embrace all the world.\"\\n The Dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance.Round her delicate  foot clung the silken boot, chestnut brown incolor, like the ribbon that floated from  her hair down upon her bareshoulders.\"\\nThe green silk dress waved in large folds, but  did notentirely hide the pretty foot and ankle.\"\\n Had she come to the enchanted Garden of Armida?\"\\nWhat was thename of the place?\"\\n The name glittered in gas-jets over the entrance.\"\\nIt was\"Mabille.\"\\n  The soaring upwards of rockets, the splashing of fountains, andthe popping of  champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchanticdance.\"\\nOver the whole glided the moon  through the air, clear, but witha somewhat crooked face.\"\\n A wild joviality seemed to rush through the Dryad, as though shewere intoxicated with  opium.\"\\nHer eyes spoke, her lips spoke, but thesound of violins and of flutes drowned  the sound of her voice.\"\\nHerpartner whispered words to her which she did not understand,  nor do weunderstand them.\"\\nHe stretched out his arms to draw her to him, buthe embraced  only the empty air.\"\\n The Dryad had been carried away, like a rose-leaf on the wind.Before her she saw a  flame in the air, a flashing light high up on atower.\"\\nThe beacon light shone from  the goal of her longing, shone fromthe red lighthouse tower of the Fata Morgana of  the Champ de Mars.Thither she was carried by the wind.\"\\nShe circled round the tower;the  workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early, andthat now sank down  dying.\"\\n The moon shone bright, gas-lamps spread light around, throughthe halls, over the  all-world\\'s buildings scattered about, over therose-hills and the rocks produced by  human ingenuity, from whichwaterfalls, driven by the power of \"Master Bloodless,\"  fell down.The caverns of the sea, the depths of the lakes, the kingdom of thefishes  were opened here.\"\\nMen walked as in the depths of the deep pond,and held converse with  the sea, in the diving-bell of glass.\"\\nThe waterpressed against the strong glass walls  above and on every side.\"\\nThepolypi, eel-like living creatures, had fastened  themselves to thebottom, and stretched out arms, fathoms long, for prey.\"\\nA big  turbotwas making himself broad in front, quietly enough, but not withoutcasting some  suspicious glances aside.\"\\nA crab clambered over him,looking like a gigantic spider,  while the shrimps wandered about inrestless haste, like the butterflies and moths  of the sea.\"\\n In the fresh water grew water-lilies, nymphaea, and reeds; thegold-fishes stood up  below in rank and file, all turning their headsone way, that the streaming water might  flow into their mouths.\"\\nFatcarps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes.\"\\nThey knew  that theywere here to be exhibited, and that they had made the somewhattoilsome  journey hither in tubs filled with water; and they thoughtwith dismay of the  land-sickness from which they had suffered socruelly on the railway.\"\\n They had come to see the Exhibition, and now contemplated itfrom their fresh or  salt-water position.\"\\nThey looked attentively atthe crowds of people who passed by  them early and late.\"\\nAll thenations in the world, they thought, had made an exhibition  of theirinhabitants, for the edification of the soles and haddocks, pike andcarp,  that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds.\"\\n \"Those are scaly animals\" said a little slimy Whiting.\"\\n\"They puton different scales  two or three times a day, and they emit soundswhich they call speaking.\"\\nWe don\\'t put  on scales, and we makeourselves understood in an easier way, simply by twitching the  cornersof our mouths and staring with our eyes.\"\\nWe have a great manyadvantages over  mankind.\"\\n  \"But they have learned swimming of us,\" remarked a well-educatedCodling.\"\\n\"You must  know I come from the great sea outside.\"\\nIn thehot time of the year the people yonder  go into the water; first theytake off their scales, and then they swim.\"\\nThey have  learnt from thefrogs to kick out with their hind legs, and row with their forepaws.\"\\n But they cannot hold out long.\"\\nThey want to be like us, but theycannot come up to  us.\"\\nPoor people!\"\\n  And the fishes stared.\"\\nThey thought that the whole swarm of peoplewhom they had seen  in the bright daylight were still moving aroundthem; they were certain they still  saw the same forms that had firstcaught their attention.\"\\n A pretty Barbel, with spotted skin, and an enviably round back,declared that the  \"human fry\" were still there.\"\\n \"I can see a well set-up human figure quite well,\" said theBarbel.\"\\n\"She was called  \\'contumacious lady,\\' or something of thatkind.\"\\nShe had a mouth and staring eyes, like  ours, and a great balloonat the back of her head, and something like a shut-up umbrella  infront; there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about her.She ought  to take all the rubbish off, and go as we do; then she wouldlook something like a  respectable barbel, so far as it is possible fora person to look like one!\"\\n  \"What\\'s become of that one whom they drew away with the hook?\"\\nHesat on a wheel-chair,  and had paper, and pen, and ink, and wrotedown everything.\"\\nThey called him a \\'writer.\\'\"  \"They\\'re going about with him still,\" said a hoary old maid of aCarp, who carried  her misfortune about with her, so that she was quitehoarse.\"\\nIn her youth she had once  swallowed a hook, and still swampatiently about with it in her gullet.\"\\n\"A writer?\"\\n That means, as wefishes describe it, a kind of cuttle or ink-fish among men.\"\\n  Thus the fishes gossipped in their own way; but in theartificial water-grotto the  laborers were busy; who were obliged totake advantage of the hours of night to get  their work done bydaybreak.\"\\nThey accompanied with blows of their hammers and withsongs  the parting words of the vanishing Dryad.\"\\n \"So, at any rate, I have seen you, you pretty gold-fishes,\" shesaid.\"\\n\"Yes, I know  you;\" and she waved her hand to them.\"\\n\"I have knownabout you a long time in my home;  the swallow told me about you.\"\\nHowbeautiful you are!\"\\nhow delicate and shining!\"\\nI should  like to kissevery one of you.\"\\nYou others, also.\"\\nI know you all; but you do notknow  me.\"\\n  The fishes stared out into the twilight.\"\\nThey did not understand aword of it.\"\\n The Dryad was there no longer.\"\\nShe had been a long time in theopen air, where the  different countries- the country of black bread,the codfish coast, the kingdom of  Russia leather, and the banks ofeau-de-Cologne, and the gardens of rose oil- exhaled  their perfumesfrom the world-wonder flower.\"\\n When, after a night at a ball, we drive home half asleep andhalf awake, the melodies  still sound plainly in our ears; we hearthem, and could sing them all from memory.\"\\n When the eye of themurdered man closes, the picture of what it saw last clings to  itfor a time like a photographic picture.\"\\n So it was likewise here.\"\\nThe bustling life of day had not yetdisappeared in the quiet  night.\"\\nThe Dryad had seen it; she knew,thus it will be repeated tomorrow.\"\\n The Dryad stood among the fragrant roses, and thought she knewthem, and had seen them  in her own home.\"\\nShe also saw redpomegranate flowers, like those that little Mary  had worn in herdark hair.\"\\n Remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through herthoughts; her eyes  eagerly drank in the prospect around, andfeverish restlessness chased her through  the wonder-filled halls.\"\\n A weariness that increased continually, took possession of her.She felt a longing  to rest on the soft Oriental carpets within, orto lean against the weeping willow  without by the clear water.\"\\nBut forthe ephemeral fly there was no rest.\"\\nIn a few moments  the day hadcompleted its circle.\"\\n Her thoughts trembled, her limbs trembled, she sank down on thegrass by the bubbling  water.\"\\n \"Thou wilt ever spring living from the earth,\" she saidmournfully.\"\\n\"Moisten my tongue\\ufffebring me a refreshing draught.\"\\n  \"I am no living water,\" was the answer.\"\\n\"I only spring upward whenthe machine wills  it.\"\\n  \"Give me something of thy freshness, thou green grass,\" imploredthe Dryad; \"give me  one of thy fragrant flowers.\"\\n  \"We must die if we are torn from our stalks,\" replied theFlowers and the Grass.\"\\n \"Give me a kiss, thou fresh stream of air- only a singlelife-kiss.\"\\n  \"Soon the sun will kiss the clouds red,\" answered the Wind;\"then thou wilt be among  the dead- blown away, as all the splendorhere will be blown away before the year shall  have ended.\"\\nThen I canplay again with the light loose sand on the place here, and  whirlthe dust over the land and through the air.\"\\nAll is dust!\"\\n  The Dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder herpulse-artery in the bath,  but is filled again with the love of life,even while she is bleeding to death.\"\\nShe  raised herself, totteredforward a few steps, and sank down again at the entrance to  a littlechurch.\"\\nThe gate stood open, lights were burning upon the altar, andthe organ  sounded.\"\\n What music!\"\\nSuch notes the Dryad had never yet heard; and yet itseemed to her as if  she recognized a number of well-known voices amongthem.\"\\nThey came deep from the heart  of all creation.\"\\nShe thought sheheard the stories of the old clergyman, of great deeds,  and of thecelebrated names, and of the gifts that the creatures of God mustbestow  upon posterity, if they would live on in the world.\"\\n The tones of the organ swelled, and in their song there soundedthese words:  \"Thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee, with thy roots,from the place which God  appointed for thee.\"\\nThat was thy destruction,thou poor Dryad!\"\\n  The notes became soft and gentle, and seemed to die away in awail.\"\\n In the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam.\"\\nTheWind sighed:  \"Pass away, ye dead!\"\\nnow the sun is going to rise!\"\\n  The first ray fell on the Dryad.\"\\nHer form was irradiated inchanging colors, like the  soap-bubble when it is bursting andbecomes a drop of water; like a tear that falls  and passes away like avapor.\"\\n Poor Dryad!\"\\nOnly a dew-drop, only a tear, poured upon the earth,and vanished away!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE DUMB BOOK  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the high-road which led through a wood stood a solitaryfarm-house; the road, in  fact, ran right through its yard.\"\\nThe sun wasshining and all the windows were open;  within the house people werevery busy.\"\\nIn the yard, in an arbour formed by lilac bushes  in fullbloom, stood an open coffin; thither they had carried a dead man,who was to  be buried that very afternoon.\"\\nNobody shed a tear over him;his face was covered over  with a white cloth, under his head theyhad placed a large thick book, the leaves of  which consisted of foldedsheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers lay between  them; itwas the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was tobe buried  with him, according to his own wish.\"\\nEvery one of theflowers in it was connected with  some chapter of his life.\"\\n \"Who is the dead man?\"\\n we asked.\"\\n \"The old student,\" was the reply.\"\\n\"They say that he was once anenergetic young man,  that he studied the dead languages, and sangand even composed many songs; then  something had happened to him,and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink,  body and mind.When at last he had ruined his health, they brought him into thecountry,  where someone paid for his board and residence.\"\\nHe was gentleas a child as long as  the sullen mood did not come over him; butwhen it came he was fierce, became as strong  as a giant, and ran aboutin the wood like a chased deer.\"\\nBut when we succeeded in  bringinghim home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-upplants  in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at thisor that plant, while  frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.God knows what was in his mind; but he  requested us to put the bookinto his coffin, and now he lies there.\"\\nIn a little while  the lid willbe placed upon the coffin, and he will have sweet rest in the grave!\"\\n  The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man\\'sface expressed peace\\ufffea sunbeam fell upon it.\"\\nA swallow flew withthe swiftness of an arrow into the arbour,  turning in its flight,and twittered over the dead man\\'s head.\"\\n What a strange feeling it is- surely we all know it- to lookthrough old letters of  our young days; a different life rises up outof the past, as it were, with all its  hopes and sorrows.\"\\nHow many ofthe people with whom in those days we used to be on  intimate termsappear to us as if dead, and yet they are still alive- only we havenot  thought of them for such a long time, whom we imagined we shouldretain in our memories  for ever, and share every joy and sorrow withthem.\"\\n The withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the friend, theschoolfellow, who was  to be his friend for life.\"\\nHe fixed the leafto the student\\'s cap in the green wood,  when they vowed eternalfriendship.\"\\nWhere does he dwell now?\"\\nThe leaf is kept, but  thefriendship does no longer exist.\"\\nHere is a foreign hothouse plant, tootender for  the gardens of the North.\"\\nIt is almost as if its leavesstill smelt sweet!\"\\nShe gave  it to him out of her own garden- anobleman\\'s daughter.\"\\n Here is a water-lily that he had plucked himself, and watered withsalt tears- a lily  of sweet water.\"\\nAnd here is a nettle: what mayits leaves tell us?\"\\nWhat might he have  thought when he plucked andkept it?\"\\nHere is a little snowdrop out of the solitary  wood; here isan evergreen from the flower-pot at the tavern; and here is a simpleblade  of grass.\"\\n The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead man\\'shead; the swallow passes  again- \"twit, twit;\" now the men come withhammer and nails, the lid is placed over  the dead man, while hishead rests on the dumb book- so long cherished, now closed  for ever!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE ELF OF THE ROSE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the midst of a garden grew a rose-tree, in full blossom, and inthe prettiest of  all the roses lived an elf.\"\\nHe was such a littlewee thing, that no human eye could  see him.\"\\nBehind each leaf of therose he had a sleeping chamber.\"\\nHe was as well formed  and as beautifulas a little child could be, and had wings that reached from  hisshoulders to his feet.\"\\nOh, what sweet fragrance there was in hischambers!\"\\nand how  clean and beautiful were the walls!\"\\nfor they werethe blushing leaves of the rose.\"\\n During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, flewfrom flower to flower,  and danced on the wings of the flyingbutterflies.\"\\nThen he took it into his head to  measure how many stepshe would have to go through the roads and cross-roads that are  onthe leaf of a linden-tree.\"\\nWhat we call the veins on a leaf, he tookfor roads; ay,  and very long roads they were for him; for before hehad half finished his task, the  sun went down: he had commenced hiswork too late.\"\\nIt became very cold, the dew fell,  and the wind blew;so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home.\"\\n Hehurried himself as much as he could; but he found the roses all closedup, and he  could not get in; not a single rose stood open.\"\\nThe poorlittle elf was very much  frightened.\"\\nHe had never before been out atnight, but had always slumbered secretly  behind the warmrose-leaves.\"\\nOh, this would certainly be his death.\"\\nAt the other endof  the garden, he knew there was an arbor, overgrown with beautifulhoney-suckles.\"\\nThe  blossoms looked like large painted horns; and hethought to himself, he would go and  sleep in one of these till themorning.\"\\nHe flew thither; but \"hush!\"\\n two people were  in the arbor,- ahandsome young man and a beautiful lady.\"\\nThey sat side by side,  andwished that they might never be obliged to part.\"\\nThey loved each othermuch more  than the best child can love its father and mother.\"\\n \"But we must part,\" said the young man; \"your brother does notlike our engagement,  and therefore he sends me so far away onbusiness, over mountains and seas.\"\\nFarewell,  my sweet bride; for soyou are to me.\"\\n  And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him arose; but before  she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so ferventlythat the flower opened.\"\\nThen the  little elf flew in, and leaned hishead on the delicate, fragrant walls.\"\\nHere he could  plainly hearthem say, \"Farewell, farewell;\" and he felt that the rose had beenplaced  on the young man\\'s breast.\"\\nOh, how his heart did beat!\"\\nThelittle elf could not go  to sleep, it thumped so loudly.\"\\nThe youngman took it out as he walked through the  dark wood alone, and kissedthe flower so often and so violently, that the little elf  was almostcrushed.\"\\nHe could feel through the leaf how hot the lips of theyoung man  were, and the rose had opened, as if from the heat of thenoonday sun.\"\\n There came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked.\"\\nHe was thewicked brother of  the beautiful maiden.\"\\nHe drew out a sharp knife, andwhile the other was kissing the  rose, the wicked man stabbed him todeath; then he cut off his head, and buried it  with the body in thesoft earth under the linden-tree.\"\\n \"Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten,\" thought the wickedbrother; \"he will  never come back again.\"\\nHe was going on a longjourney over mountains and seas; it is  easy for a man to lose his lifein such a journey.\"\\nMy sister will suppose he is dead;  for he cannotcome back, and she will not dare to question me about him.\"\\n  Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with hisfoot, and went home  through the darkness; but he went not alone, as hethought,- the little elf accompanied  him.\"\\nHe sat in a dry rolled-uplinden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the  wicked man\\'shead, as he was digging the grave.\"\\nThe hat was on the head now,which made  it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with frightand indignation at the wicked  deed.\"\\n It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home;he took off his hat,  and went into his sister\\'s room.\"\\nThere lay thebeautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of  him whom she loved so, and whowas now, she supposed, travelling far away over mountain  and sea.Her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed hideously, asfiends only  can laugh.\"\\nThe dry leaf fell out of his hair upon thecounterpane; but he did not notice  it, and went to get a littlesleep during the early morning hours.\"\\nBut the elf slipped  out of thewithered leaf, placed himself by the ear of the sleeping girl, andtold her,  as in a dream, of the horrid murder; described the placewhere her brother had slain  her lover, and buried his body; and toldher of the linden-tree, in full blossom, that  stood close by.\"\\n \"That you may not think this is only a dream that I have toldyou,\" he said, \"you will  find on your bed a withered leaf.\"\\n  Then she awoke, and found it there.\"\\nOh, what bitter tears sheshed!\"\\nand she could not  open her heart to any one for relief.\"\\n The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf couldeasily have reached the  roses, or any of the flowers; but he could notfind it in his heart to leave one so  afflicted.\"\\nIn the window stooda bush bearing monthly roses.\"\\nHe seated himself in one  of the flowers,and gazed on the poor girl.\"\\nHer brother often came into the room,and  would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base conduct; so she darenot say a word to  him of her heart\\'s grief.\"\\n As soon as night came on, she slipped out of the house, and wentinto the wood, to  the spot where the linden-tree stood; and afterremoving the leaves from the earth,  she turned it up, and therefound him who had been murdered.\"\\nOh, how she wept and prayed  thatshe also might die!\"\\nGladly would she have taken the body home withher; but that  was impossible; so she took up the poor head with theclosed eyes, kissed the cold  lips, and shook the mould out of thebeautiful hair.\"\\n \"I will keep this,\" said she; and as soon as she had covered thebody again with the  earth and leaves, she took the head and a littlesprig of jasmine that bloomed in the  wood, near the spot where hewas buried, and carried them home with her.\"\\nAs soon as  she was inher room, she took the largest flower-pot she could find, and inthis she  placed the head of the dead man, covered it up with earth,and planted the twig of  jasmine in it.\"\\n \"Farewell, farewell,\" whispered the little elf.\"\\nHe could not anylonger endure to  witness all this agony of grief, he therefore flewaway to his own rose in the garden.\"\\n But the rose was faded; only a fewdry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind  it.\"\\n \"Alas!\"\\nhow soon all that is good and beautiful passes away,\"sighed the elf.\"\\n After a while he found another rose, which became his home, foramong its delicate  fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety.\"\\nEverymorning he flew to the window of the  poor girl, and always found herweeping by the flower pot.\"\\nThe bitter tears fell upon  the jasminetwig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprigappeared to  grow greener and fresher.\"\\nOne shoot after another sproutedforth, and little white  buds blossomed, which the poor girl fondlykissed.\"\\nBut her wicked brother scolded her,  and asked her if she wasgoing mad.\"\\nHe could not imagine why she was weeping over  thatflower-pot, and it annoyed him.\"\\nHe did not know whose closed eyes werethere, nor  what red lips were fading beneath the earth.\"\\nAnd one dayshe sat and leaned her head  against the flower-pot, and the little elfof the rose found her asleep.\"\\nThen he seated  himself by her ear,talked to her of that evening in the arbor, of the sweet perfume  ofthe rose, and the loves of the elves.\"\\nSweetly she dreamed, and whileshe dreamt,  her life passed away calmly and gently, and her spirit waswith him whom she loved,  in heaven.\"\\nAnd the jasmine opened its largewhite bells, and spread forth its sweet  fragrance; it had no other wayof showing its grief for the dead.\"\\nBut the wicked brother  consideredthe beautiful blooming plant as his own property, left to him by hissister,  and he placed it in his sleeping room, close by his bed, forit was very lovely in  appearance, and the fragrance sweet anddelightful.\"\\nThe little elf of the rose followed  it, and flew fromflower to flower, telling each little spirit that dwelt in them  thestory of the murdered young man, whose head now formed part of theearth beneath  them, and of the wicked brother and the poor sister.\"\\n\"Weknow it,\" said each little  spirit in the flowers, \"we know it, forhave we not sprung from the eyes and lips of  the murdered one.\"\\nWe knowit, we know it,\" and the flowers nodded with their heads  in a peculiarmanner.\"\\nThe elf of the rose could not understand how they could restso  quietly in the matter, so he flew to the bees, who were gatheringhoney, and told them  of the wicked brother.\"\\nAnd the bees told it totheir queen, who commanded that the  next morning they should go andkill the murderer.\"\\nBut during the night, the first  after thesister\\'s death, while the brother was sleeping in his bed, close towhere  he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every flower cup opened, andinvisibly the little  spirits stole out, armed with poisonous spears.They placed themselves by the ear of  the sleeper, told him dreadfuldreams and then flew across his lips, and pricked his  tongue withtheir poisoned spears.\"\\n\"Now have we revenged the dead,\" said they, andflew  back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers.\"\\nWhen themorning came, and as soon  as the window was opened, the rose elf, withthe queen bee, and the whole swarm of  bees, rushed in to kill him.\"\\nButhe was already dead.\"\\nPeople were standing round the  bed, and sayingthat the scent of the jasmine had killed him.\"\\nThen the elf of the  roseunderstood the revenge of the flowers, and explained it to the queenbee, and she,  with the whole swarm, buzzed about the flower-pot.\"\\nThebees could not be driven away.\"\\n Then a man took it up to remove it, andone of the bees stung him in the hand, so that  he let the flower-potfall, and it was broken to pieces.\"\\nThen every one saw the  whitenedskull, and they knew the dead man in the bed was a murderer.\"\\nAnd thequeen  bee hummed in the air, and sang of the revenge of the flowers,and of the elf of the  rose and said that behind the smallest leafdwells One, who can discover evil deeds,  and punish them also.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE ELFIN HILL  by Hans Christian Andersen  A FEW large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts ofan old tree; they could  understand one another very well, for theyspoke the lizard language.\"\\n \"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill,\" saidone of the lizards;  \"I have not been able to close my eyes for twonights on account of the noise; I might  just as well have had thetoothache, for that always keeps me awake.\"\\n  \"There is something going on within there,\" said the other lizard;\"they propped up  the top of the hill with four red posts, tillcock-crow this morning, so that it is  thoroughly aired, and theelfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something.\"\\n  \"I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,\" said athird lizard; \"the  earth-worm had just come from the elfin hill, wherehe has been groping about in the  earth day and night.\"\\nHe has heard agreat deal; although he cannot see, poor miserable  creature, yet heunderstands very well how to wriggle and lurk about.\"\\nThey  expectfriends in the elfin hill, grand company, too; but who they are theearth-worm  would not say, or, perhaps, he really did not know.\"\\nAll thewill-o\\'-the-wisps are  ordered to be there to hold a torch dance, as itis called.\"\\nThe silver and gold which  is plentiful in the hill willbe polished and placed out in the moonlight.\"\\n  \"Who can the strangers be?\"\\n asked the lizards; \"what can thematter be?\"\\nHark, what  a buzzing and humming there is!\"\\n  Just at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old elfinmaiden, hollow behind,  came tripping out; she was the old elf king\\'shousekeeper, and a distant relative of  the family; therefore shewore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead.\"\\nHer feet  moved veryfast, \"trip, trip;\" good gracious, how she could trip right down tothe sea  to the night-raven.\"\\n \"You are invited to the elf hill for this evening,\" said she; \"butwill you do me a  great favor and undertake the invitations?\"\\nyouought to do something, for you have  no housekeeping to attend to asI have.\"\\nWe are going to have some very grand people,  conjurors, whohave always something to say; and therefore the old elf king wishes  tomake a great display.\"\\n  \"Who is to be invited?\"\\n asked the raven.\"\\n \"All the world may come to the great ball, even human beings, ifthey can only talk  in their sleep, or do something after ourfashion.\"\\nBut for the feast the company must  be carefully selected;we can only admit persons of high rank; I have had a dispute  myselfwith the elf king, as he thought we could not admit ghosts.\"\\nThe mermanand his  daughter must be invited first, although it may not beagreeable to them to remain  so long on dry land, but they shall have awet stone to sit on, or perhaps something  better; so I think they willnot refuse this time.\"\\nWe must have all the old demons  of the firstclass, with tails, and the hobgoblins and imps; and then I think weought  not to leave out the death-horse, or the grave-pig, or eventhe church dwarf, although  they do belong to the clergy, and are notreckoned among our people; but that is merely  their office, they arenearly related to us, and visit us very frequently.\"\\n  \"Croak,\" said the night-raven as he flew away with theinvitations.\"\\n The elfin maidens we\\'re already dancing on the elf hill, andthey danced in shawls  woven from moonshine and mist, which look verypretty to those who like such things.\"\\n The large hall within the elfhill was splendidly decorated; the floor had been washed  withmoonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment, sothat they glowed  like tulip-leaves in the light.\"\\nIn the kitchen werefrogs roasting on the spit, and  dishes preparing of snail skins,with children\\'s fingers in them, salad of mushroom  seed, hemlock,noses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman\\'s brewery,  andsparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars.\"\\nThese were allsubstantial food.\"\\n Rusty nails and church-window glass formed thedessert.\"\\nThe old elf king had his gold  crown polished up with powderedslate-pencil; it was like that used by the first form,  and verydifficult for an elf king to obtain.\"\\nIn the bedrooms, curtains werehung up  and fastened with the slime of snails; there was, indeed, abuzzing and humming  everywhere.\"\\n \"Now we must fumigate the place with burnt horse-hair and pig\\'sbristles, and then  I think I shall have done my part,\" said the elfman-servant.\"\\n \"Father, dear,\" said the youngest daughter, \"may I now hear whoour high-born visitors  are?\"\\n  \"Well, I suppose I must tell you now,\" he replied; \"two of mydaughters must prepare  themselves to be married, for the marriagescertainly will take place.\"\\nThe old goblin  from Norway, who lives inthe ancient Dovre mountains, and who possesses many castles  built ofrock and freestone, besides a gold mine, which is better than all,so it is  thought, is coming with his two sons, who are both seekinga wife.\"\\nThe old goblin is  a true-hearted, honest, old Norwegiangraybeard; cheerful and straightforward.\"\\nI knew  him formerly, whenwe used to drink together to our good fellowship: he came here once  tofetch his wife, she is dead now.\"\\nShe was the daughter of the king ofthe chalk-hills  at Moen.\"\\nThey say he took his wife from chalk; I shallbe delighted to see him again.\"\\n It is said that the boys areill-bred, forward lads, but perhaps that is not quite  correct, andthey will become better as they grow older.\"\\nLet me see that you knowhow  to teach them good manners.\"\\n  \"And when are they coming?\"\\n asked the daughter.\"\\n \"That depends upon wind and weather,\" said the elf king; \"theytravel economically.\"\\n They will come when there is the chance of aship.\"\\nI wanted them to come over to Sweden,  but the old man was notinclined to take my advice.\"\\nHe does not go forward with the  times, andthat I do not like.\"\\n  Two will-o\\'-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than the other,so of course, one  arrived first.\"\\n\"They are coming!\"\\nthey are coming!\"\\nhe cried.\"\\n \"Give me my crown,\" said the elf king, \"and let me stand in themoonshine.\"\\n  The daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground.There stood the old  goblin from the Dovre mountains, with his crown ofhardened ice and polished fir-cones.\"\\n Besides this, he wore abear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with  theirthroats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong men.\"\\n \"Is that a hill?\"\\n said the youngest of the boys, pointing to theelf hill, \"we should  call it a hole in Norway.\"\\n  \"Boys,\" said the old man, \"a hole goes in, and a hill standsout; have you no eyes  in your heads?\"\\n  Another thing they wondered at was, that they were able withouttrouble to understand  the language.\"\\n \"Take care,\" said the old man, \"or people will think you havenot been well brought  up.\"\\n  Then they entered the elfin hill, where the select and grandcompany were assembled,  and so quickly had they appeared that theyseemed to have been blown together.\"\\nBut  for each guest the neatest andpleasantest arrangement had been made.\"\\nThe sea folks  sat at table ingreat water-tubs, and they said it was just like being at home.\"\\n Allbehaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins;they put  their legs on the table and thought they were all right.\"\\n \"Feet off the table-cloth!\"\\n said the old goblin.\"\\nThey obeyed,but not immediately.\"\\n Then they tickled the ladies who waited at table,with the fir-cones, which they  carried in their pockets.\"\\nThey took offtheir boots, that they might be more at ease,  and gave them to theladies to hold.\"\\nBut their father, the old goblin, was verydifferent;  he talked pleasantly about the stately Norwegian rocks, andtold fine tales of the  waterfalls which dashed over them with aclattering noise like thunder or the sound  of an organ, spreadingtheir white foam on every side.\"\\nHe told of the salmon that leaps  inthe rushing waters, while the water-god plays on his golden harp.\"\\nHespoke of the  bright winter nights, when the sledge bells areringing, and the boys run with burning  torches across the smoothice, which is so transparent that they can see the fishes  dart forwardbeneath their feet.\"\\nHe described everything so clearly, that those  wholistened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, themen-servants  and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattlingdance,- when all at once the  old goblin gave the old elfin maiden akiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were  almost strangers toeach other.\"\\n Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, andthen with stamping feet,  which they performed very well; then followedthe artistic and solo dance.\"\\nDear me,  how they did throw their legsabout!\"\\nNo one could tell where the dance begun, or where  it ended, norindeed which were legs and which were arms, for they were all flyingabout  together, like the shavings in a saw-pit!\"\\nAnd then they spunround so quickly that  the death-horse and the grave-pig became sickand giddy, and were obliged to leave  the table.\"\\n \"Stop!\"\\n cried the old goblin,\" is that the only house-keeping theycan perform?\"\\nCan  they do anything more than dance and throw abouttheir legs, and make a whirlwind?\"\\n  \"You shall soon see what they can do,\" said the elf king.\"\\nAnd thenhe called his youngest  daughter to him.\"\\nShe was slender and fair asmoonlight, and the most graceful of all  the sisters.\"\\nShe took awhite chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly; this was  heraccomplishment.\"\\nBut the old goblin said he should not like his wife tohave such  an accomplishment, and thought his boys would have thesame objection.\"\\nAnother  daughter could make a figure like herselffollow her, as if she had a shadow, which  none of the goblin folk everhad.\"\\nThe third was of quite a different sort; she had  learnt in thebrew-house of the moor witch how to lard elfin puddings withglow-worms.\"\\n \"She will make a good housewife,\" said the old goblin, and thensaluted her with his  eyes instead of drinking her health; for he didnot drink much.\"\\n Now came the fourth daughter, with a large harp to play upon;and when she struck the  first chord, every one lifted up the leftleg (for the goblins are left-legged), and  at the second chord theyfound they must all do just what she wanted.\"\\n \"That is a dangerous woman,\" said the old goblin; and the two sonswalked out of the  hill; they had had enough of it.\"\\n\"And what can thenext daughter do?\"\\n asked the old  goblin.\"\\n \"I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,\" said she; \"and Iwill never marry, unless  I can go to Norway.\"\\n  Then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin, \"That isonly because she has  heard, in a Norwegian song, that when the worldshall decay, the cliffs of Norway will  remain standing like monuments;and she wants to get there, that she may be safe; for  she is so afraidof sinking.\"\\n  \"Ho!\"\\nho!\"\\n said the old goblin, \"is that what she means?\"\\nWell, whatcan the seventh  and last do?\"\\n  \"The sixth comes before the seventh,\" said the elf king, for hecould reckon; but the  sixth would not come forward.\"\\n \"I can only tell people the truth,\" said she.\"\\n\"No one cares forme, nor troubles himself  about me; and I have enough to do to sew mygrave clothes.\"\\n  So the seventh and last came; and what could she do?\"\\nWhy, shecould tell stories, as  many as you liked, on any subject.\"\\n \"Here are my five fingers,\" said the old goblin; \"now tell me astory for each of them.\"\\n  So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearlychoked; and when she came  to the fourth finger, there was a goldring on it, as if it knew there was to be a  betrothal.\"\\nThen the oldgoblin said, \"Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours;  for Iwill have you for a wife myself.\"\\n  Then the elfin girl said that the stories about the ring-fingerand little Peter  Playman had not yet been told.\"\\n \"We will hear them in the winter,\" said the old goblin, \"andalso about the fir and  the birch-trees, and the ghost stories, andof the tingling frost.\"\\nYou shall tell your  tales, for no one overthere can do it so well; and we will sit in the stone rooms,  where thepine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the goldendrinking-horn of the  old Norwegian kings.\"\\nThe water-god has given metwo; and when we sit there, Nix comes  to pay us a visit, and will singyou all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses.\"\\nHow  merry we shallbe!\"\\nThe salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls, and dashingagainst  the stone walls, but he will not be able to come in.\"\\nIt isindeed very pleasant to  live in old Norway.\"\\nBut where are the lads?\"\\n  Where indeed were they?\"\\nWhy, running about the fields, and blowingout the  will-o\\'-the-wisps, who so good-naturedly came and broughttheir torches.\"\\n \"What tricks have you been playing?\"\\n said the old goblin.\"\\n\"Ihave taken a mother for  you, and now you may take one of your aunts.\"\\n  But the youngsters said they would rather make a speech anddrink to their good  fellowship; they had no wish to marry.\"\\nThen theymade speeches and drank toasts, and  tipped their glasses, to show thatthey were empty.\"\\nThen they took off their coats,  and lay down on thetable to sleep; for they made themselves quite at home.\"\\nBut the  oldgoblin danced about the room with his young bride, and exchanged bootswith her,  which is more fashionable than exchanging rings.\"\\n \"The cock is crowing,\" said the old elfin maiden who acted ashousekeeper; now we must  close the shutters, that the sun may notscorch us.\"\\n  Then the hill closed up.\"\\nBut the lizards continued to run up anddown the riven tree;  and one said to the other, \"Oh, how much I waspleased with the old goblin!\"\\n  \"The boys pleased me better,\" said the earth-worm.\"\\nBut then thepoor miserable creature  could not see.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE EMPEROR\\'S NEW SUIT  by Hans Christian Andersen  MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much ofnew clothes that he spent  all his money in order to obtain them; hisonly ambition was to be always well dressed.\"\\n He did not care for hissoldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing,  infact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit ofclothes.\"\\nHe  had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would sayof a king \"He is in his  cabinet,\" so one could say of him, \"Theemperor is in his dressing-room.\"\\n  The great city where he resided was very gay; every day manystrangers from all parts  of the globe arrived.\"\\nOne day two swindlerscame to this city; they made people believe  that they were weavers,and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be  imagined.Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionallybeautiful,  but the clothes made of their material possessed thewonderful quality of being  invisible to any man who was unfit forhis office or unpardonably stupid.\"\\n \"That must be wonderful cloth,\" thought the emperor.\"\\n\"If I were tobe dressed in a  suit made of this cloth I should be able to find outwhich men in my empire were unfit  for their places, and I coulddistinguish the clever from the stupid.\"\\nI must have this  cloth wovenfor me without delay.\"\\n And he gave a large sum of money to theswindlers,  in advance, that they should set to work without any lossof time.\"\\nThey set up two  looms, and pretended to be very hard at work,but they did nothing whatever on the  looms.\"\\nThey asked for thefinest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got  they didaway with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.\"\\n \"I should very much like to know how they are getting on withthe cloth,\" thought the  emperor.\"\\nBut he felt rather uneasy when heremembered that he who was not fit for his  office could not see it.Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear,  yet hethought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how mattersstood.\"\\n Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality thestuff possessed, and all were  anxious to see how bad or stupid theirneighbours were.\"\\n \"I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,\" thoughtthe emperor.\"\\n\"He can  judge best how the stuff looks, for he isintelligent, and nobody understands his  office better than he.\"\\n  The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers satbefore the empty looms.\"\\n \"Heaven preserve us!\"\\n he thought, and openedhis eyes wide, \"I cannot see anything  at all,\" but he did not sayso.\"\\nBoth swindlers requested him to come near, and asked  him if he didnot admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointingto  the empty looms.\"\\nThe poor old minister tried his very best, buthe could see nothing,  for there was nothing to be seen.\"\\n\"Oh dear,\"he thought, \"can I be so stupid?\"\\nI should  never have thought so, andnobody must know it!\"\\nIs it possible that I am not fit for  my office?No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth.\"\\n  \"Now, have you got nothing to say?\"\\n said one of the swindlers,while he pretended to  be busily weaving.\"\\n \"Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,\" replied the oldminister looking  through his glasses.\"\\n\"What a beautiful pattern,what brilliant colours!\"\\nI shall tell  the emperor that I like the clothvery much.\"\\n  \"We are pleased to hear that,\" said the two weavers, and describedto him the colours  and explained the curious pattern.\"\\nThe old ministerlistened attentively, that he  might relate to the emperor what theysaid; and so he did.\"\\n Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, whichthey required for  weaving.\"\\nThey kept everything for themselves, andnot a thread came near the loom,  but they continued, as hitherto, towork at the empty looms.\"\\n Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to theweavers to see how  they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearlyfinished.\"\\nLike the old minister,  he looked and looked but could seenothing, as there was nothing to be seen.\"\\n \"Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?\"\\n asked the two swindlers,showing and explaining  the magnificent pattern, which, however, didnot exist.\"\\n \"I am not stupid,\" said the man.\"\\n\"It is therefore my goodappointment for which I am  not fit.\"\\nIt is very strange, but I must notlet any one know it;\" and he praised the  cloth, which he did notsee, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the  finepattern.\"\\n\"It is very excellent,\" he said to the emperor.\"\\n Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth.\"\\nAtlast the emperor wished  to see it himself, while it was still on theloom.\"\\nWith a number of courtiers, including  the two who had alreadybeen there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked  ashard as they could, but without using any thread.\"\\n \"Is it not magnificent?\"\\n said the two old statesmen who had beenthere before.\"\\n\"Your  Majesty must admire the colours and thepattern.\"\\n And then they pointed to the empty  looms, for theyimagined the others could see the cloth.\"\\n \"What is this?\"\\n thought the emperor, \"I do not see anything atall.\"\\nThat is terrible!\"\\n Am I stupid?\"\\nAm I unfit to be emperor?\"\\nThatwould indeed be the most dreadful thing  that could happen to me.\"\\n  \"Really,\" he said, turning to the weavers, \"your cloth has ourmost gracious approval;\"  and nodding contentedly he looked at theempty loom, for he did not like to say that  he saw nothing.\"\\nAll hisattendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although  theycould not see anything more than the others, they said, like theemperor, \"It is  very beautiful.\"\\n And all advised him to wear the newmagnificent clothes at a great  procession which was soon to takeplace.\"\\n\"It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,\"  one heard themsay; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed thetwo  swindlers \"Imperial Court weavers.\"\\n  The whole night previous to the day on which the procession was totake place, the  swindlers pretended to work, and burned more thansixteen candles.\"\\nPeople should see  that they were busy to finish theemperor\\'s new suit.\"\\nThey pretended to take the cloth  from the loom,and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed withneedles  without thread, and said at last: \"The emperor\\'s new suit isready now.\"\\n  The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; theswindlers held their arms  up as if they held something in theirhands and said: \"These are the trousers!\"\\n \"This  is the coat!\"\\n and\"Here is the cloak!\"\\n and so on.\"\\n\"They are all as light as a cobweb,and  one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but thatis just the beauty  of them.\"\\n  \"Indeed!\"\\n said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything,for there was  nothing to be seen.\"\\n \"Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,\" saidthe swindlers, \"that  we may assist your Majesty in putting on thenew suit before the large looking-glass?\"\\n  The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put thenew suit upon him, one  piece after another; and the emperor lookedat himself in the glass from every side.\"\\n \"How well they look!\"\\nHow well they fit!\"\\n said all.\"\\n\"What abeautiful pattern!\"\\nWhat  fine colours!\"\\nThat is a magnificent suit ofclothes!\"\\n  The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of thecanopy, which was to  be carried in the procession, were ready.\"\\n \"I am ready,\" said the emperor.\"\\n\"Does not my suit fit memarvellously?\"\\n Then he turned  once more to the looking-glass, thatpeople should think he admired his garments.\"\\n The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched theirhands to the ground  as if they lifted up a train, and pretended tohold something in their hands; they  did not like people to know thatthey could not see anything.\"\\n The emperor marched in the procession under the beautifulcanopy, and all who saw him  in the street and out of the windowsexclaimed: \"Indeed, the emperor\\'s new suit is  incomparable!\"\\nWhat along train he has!\"\\nHow well it fits him!\"\\n Nobody wished to  letothers know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit forhis office or  too stupid.\"\\nNever emperor\\'s clothes were more admired.\"\\n \"But he has nothing on at all,\" said a little child at last.\"\\n\"Goodheavens!\"\\nlisten  to the voice of an innocent child,\" said the father,and one whispered to the other  what the child had said.\"\\n\"But he hasnothing on at all,\" cried at last the whole people.\"\\n That made a deepimpression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they wereright;  but he thought to himself, \"Now I must bear up to the end.\"\\n Andthe chamberlains walked  with still greater dignity, as if they carriedthe train which did not exist.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE FARM-YARD COCK AND THE WEATHER-COCK  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE were two cocks- one on the dung-hill, the other on the roof.They were both  arrogant, but which of the two rendered most service?Tell us your opinion- we\\'ll keep  to ours just the same though.\"\\n The poultry yard was divided by some planks from another yard inwhich there was a  dung-hill, and on the dung-hill lay and grew a largecucumber which was conscious of  being a hot-bed plant.\"\\n \"One is born to that,\" said the cucumber to itself.\"\\n\"Not all canbe born cucumbers;  there must be other things, too.\"\\nThe hens, theducks, and all the animals in the next  yard are creatures too.\"\\nNow Ihave a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he  is certainly ofmuch more importance than the weather-cock who is placed so high  andcan\\'t even creak, much less crow.\"\\nThe latter has neither hens norchicks, and only  thinks of himself and perspires verdigris.\"\\nNo, theyard cock is really a cock!\"\\nHis  step is a dance!\"\\nHis crowing is music,and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter  is like!\"\\nIf he wouldonly come in here!\"\\nEven if he ate me up stump, stalk, and all,  and Ihad to dissolve in his body, it would be a happy death,\" said thecucumber.\"\\n In the night there was a terrible storm.\"\\nThe hens, chicks, andeven the cock sought  shelter; the wind tore down the planks betweenthe two yards with a crash; the tiles  came tumbling down, but theweather-cock sat firm.\"\\nHe did not even turn round, for  he could not;and yet he was young and freshly cast, but prudent and sedate.\"\\nHehad  been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying in theair- the sparrows,  and the swallows; no, he despised them, thesemean little piping birds, these common  whistlers.\"\\nHe admitted that thepigeons, large and white and shining like  mother-o\\'-pearl, looked likea kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid,  and all theirthoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with  food,and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with.\"\\nThe birdsof passage  had also paid the weather-cock a visit and told him offoreign countries, of airy  caravans and robber stories that made one\\'shair stand on end.\"\\nAll this was new and  interesting; that is, forthe first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found  out, theyrepeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that\\'svery tedious,  and there was no one with whom one could associate,for one and all were stale and  small-minded.\"\\n \"The world is no good!\"\\n he said.\"\\n\"Everything in it is so stupid.\"\\n  The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would have madehim interesting in  the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it, but ithad eyes only for the yard cock,  who was now in the yard with it.\"\\n The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was over.\"\\n \"What do you think of that crowing?\"\\n said the yard cock to thehens and chickens.\"\\n\"It  was a little rough- it wanted elegance.\"\\n  And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and the cockstrutted about like  a lord.\"\\n \"Garden plant!\"\\n he said to the cucumber, and in that one wordhis deep learning showed  itself, and it forgot that he was peckingat her and eating it up.\"\\n\"A happy death!\"\\n  The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the othersrun too; they clucked,  and chirped, and looked at the cock, and wereproud that he was of their kind.\"\\n \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"\\n he crowed, \"the chickens will grow up intogreat hens at once,  if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the world!\"\\n  And hens and chicks clucked and chirped, and the cock announceda great piece of news.\"\\n \"A cock can lay an egg!\"\\nAnd do you know what\\'s in that egg?\"\\nAbasilisk.\"\\nNo one can  stand the sight of such a thing; people knowthat, and now you know it too- you know  what is in me, and what achampion of all cocks I am!\"\\n  With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb swell up,and crowed again;  and they all shuddered, the hens and the littlechicks- but they were very proud that  one of their number was such achampion of all cocks.\"\\nThey clucked and chirped till  theweather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.\"\\n \"Everything is very stupid,\" the weather-cock said to himself.\"\\nThe yard cock lays  no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so; if I liked, Icould lay a wind-egg.\"\\nBut the world  is not worth even a wind-egg.Everything is so stupid!\"\\nI don\\'t want to sit here any  longer.\"\\n  With that the weather-cock broke off; but he did not kill the yardcock, although the  hens said that had been his intention.\"\\nAnd whatis the moral?\"\\n\"Better to crow than  to be puffed up and break off!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE FIR TREE  by Hans Christian Andersen  FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh airmade a sweet resting-place,  grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yetit was not happy, it wished so much to be tall  like its companions-the pines and firs which grew around it.\"\\nThe sun shone, and the  softair fluttered its leaves, and the little peasant children passed by,prattling  merrily, but the fir-tree heeded them not.\"\\nSometimes thechildren would bring a large  basket of raspberries or strawberries,wreathed on a straw, and seat themselves near  the fir-tree, and say,\"Is it not a pretty little tree?\"\\n which made it feel more unhappy  thanbefore.\"\\nAnd yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint tallerevery year;  for by the number of joints in the stem of a fir-tree wecan discover its age.\"\\nStill,  as it grew, it complained, \"Oh!\"\\nhow Iwish I were as tall as the other trees, then  I would spread out mybranches on every side, and my top would over-look the wide world.\"\\n Ishould have the birds building their nests on my boughs, and whenthe wind blew, I  should bow with stately dignity like my tallcompanions.\"\\n The tree was so discontented,  that it took no pleasure inthe warm sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that  floated overit morning and evening.\"\\nSometimes, in winter, when the snow laywhite and  glittering on the ground, a hare would come springing along,and jump right over the  little tree; and then how mortified it wouldfeel!\"\\nTwo winters passed, and when the  third arrived, the tree hadgrown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it.\"\\n Yet itremained unsatisfied, and would exclaim, \"Oh, if I could but keep ongrowing  tall and old!\"\\nThere is nothing else worth caring for in theworld!\"\\n In the autumn,  as usual, the wood-cutters came and cut downseveral of the tallest trees, and the  young fir-tree, which was nowgrown to its full height, shuddered as the noble trees  fell to theearth with a crash.\"\\nAfter the branches were lopped off, the trunkslooked  so slender and bare, that they could scarcely be recognized.Then they were placed  upon wagons, and drawn by horses out of theforest.\"\\n\"Where were they going?\"\\nWhat would  become of them?\"\\n Theyoung fir-tree wished very much to know; so in the spring, when  theswallows and the storks came, it asked, \"Do you know where those treeswere taken?\"\\n Did you meet them?\"\\n  The swallows knew nothing, but the stork, after a littlereflection, nodded his head,  and said, \"Yes, I think I do.\"\\nI metseveral new ships when I flew from Egypt, and they  had fine masts thatsmelt like fir.\"\\nI think these must have been the trees; I assure  youthey were stately, very stately.\"\\n  \"Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea,\" said thefir-tree.\"\\n\"What is the  sea, and what does it look like?\"\\n  \"It would take too much time to explain,\" said the stork, flyingquickly away.\"\\n \"Rejoice in thy youth,\" said the sunbeam; \"rejoice in thy freshgrowth, and the young  life that is in thee.\"\\n  And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with tears;but the fir-tree  regarded them not.\"\\n Christmas-time drew near, and many young trees were cut down, someeven smaller and  younger than the fir-tree who enjoyed neither restnor peace with longing to leave  its forest home.\"\\nThese young trees,which were chosen for their beauty, kept their  branches, and were alsolaid on wagons and drawn by horses out of the forest.\"\\n \"Where are they going?\"\\n asked the fir-tree.\"\\n\"They are not tallerthan I am: indeed,  one is much less; and why are the branches notcut off?\"\\nWhere are they going?\"\\n  \"We know, we know,\" sang the sparrows; \"we have looked in at thewindows of the houses  in the town, and we know what is done with them.They are dressed up in the most splendid  manner.\"\\nWe have seen themstanding in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with all  sorts ofbeautiful things,- honey cakes, gilded apples, playthings, and manyhundreds  of wax tapers.\"\\n  \"And then,\" asked the fir-tree, trembling through all itsbranches, \"and then what  happens?\"\\n  \"We did not see any more,\" said the sparrows; \"but this was enoughfor us.\"\\n  \"I wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen to me,\"thought the fir-tree.\"\\n \"It would be much better than crossing thesea.\"\\nI long for it almost with pain.\"\\nOh!\"\\n when will Christmas behere?\"\\nI am now as tall and well grown as those which were taken  awaylast year.\"\\nOh!\"\\nthat I were now laid on the wagon, or standing in thewarm room,  with all that brightness and splendor around me!Something better and more beautiful  is to come after, or the treeswould not be so decked out.\"\\nYes, what follows will be  grander and moresplendid.\"\\nWhat can it be?\"\\nI am weary with longing.\"\\nI scarcely know  howI feel.\"\\n  \"Rejoice with us,\" said the air and the sunlight.\"\\n\"Enjoy thine ownbright life in the  fresh air.\"\\n  But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller every day;and, winter and summer,  its dark-green foliage might be seen in theforest, while passers by would say, \"What  a beautiful tree!\"\\n  A short time before Christmas, the discontented fir-tree was thefirst to fall.\"\\nAs  the axe cut through the stem, and divided thepith, the tree fell with a groan to the  earth, conscious of pain andfaintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of  happiness, insorrow at leaving its home in the forest.\"\\nIt knew that it should  neveragain see its dear old companions, the trees, nor the little bushesand  many-colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps noteven the birds.\"\\nNeither  was the journey at all pleasant.\"\\nThe treefirst recovered itself while being unpacked  in the courtyard of ahouse, with several other trees; and it heard a man say, \"We  only wantone, and this is the prettiest.\"\\n  Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the fir-treeinto a large and  beautiful apartment.\"\\nOn the walls hung pictures,and near the great stove stood great  china vases, with lions on thelids.\"\\nThere were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large  tables, coveredwith pictures, books, and playthings, worth a great deal of money,-  atleast, the children said so.\"\\nThen the fir-tree was placed in a largetub, full of  sand; but green baize hung all around it, so that noone could see it was a tub, and  it stood on a very handsome carpet.How the fir-tree trembled!\"\\n\"What was going to happen  to him now?\"\\n Someyoung ladies came, and the servants helped them to adorn the tree.On  one branch they hung little bags cut out of colored paper, and eachbag was filled  with sweetmeats; from other branches hung gilded applesand walnuts, as if they had  grown there; and above, and all round,were hundreds of red, blue, and white tapers,  which were fastened onthe branches.\"\\nDolls, exactly like real babies, were placed under  thegreen leaves,- the tree had never seen such things before,- and at thevery top  was fastened a glittering star, made of tinsel.\"\\nOh, it wasvery beautiful!\"\\n \"This evening,\" they all exclaimed, \"how bright it will be!\"\\n\"Oh, that the evening  were come,\" thought the tree, \"and the taperslighted!\"\\nthen I shall know what else  is going to happen.\"\\nWill thetrees of the forest come to see me?\"\\nI wonder if the sparrows  will peepin at the windows as they fly?\"\\nshall I grow faster here, and keep onall these  ornaments summer and winter?\"\\n But guessing was of verylittle use; it made his bark  ache, and this pain is as bad for aslender fir-tree, as headache is for us.\"\\nAt last  the tapers werelighted, and then what a glistening blaze of light the tree  presented!It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candlesfell  among the green leaves and burnt some of them.\"\\n\"Help!\"\\nhelp!\"\\nexclaimed the young ladies,  but there was no danger, for theyquickly extinguished the fire.\"\\nAfter this, the tree  tried not totremble at all, though the fire frightened him; he was so anxiousnot to  hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even while theirbrilliancy dazzled him.\"\\nAnd now  the folding doors were thrown open,and a troop of children rushed in as if they  intended to upset thetree; they were followed more silently by their elders.\"\\nFor a  momentthe little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then theyshouted for joy,  till the room rang, and they danced merrily round thetree, while one present after  another was taken from it.\"\\n \"What are they doing?\"\\nWhat will happen next?\"\\n thought the fir.At last the candles  burnt down to the branches and were put out.Then the children received permission  to plunder the tree.\"\\n Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked, and had itnot been fastened  with the glistening star to the ceiling, it musthave been thrown down.\"\\nThe children  then danced about with theirpretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the  children\\'s maidwho came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig  hadbeen forgotten.\"\\n \"A story, a story,\" cried the children, pulling a little fat mantowards the tree.\"\\n \"Now we shall be in the green shade,\" said the man, as he seatedhimself under it,  \"and the tree will have the pleasure of hearingalso, but I shall only relate one story;  what shall it be?Ivede-Avede, or Humpty Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon got  upagain, and at last married a princess.\"\\n  \"Ivede-Avede,\" cried some.\"\\n\"Humpty Dumpty,\" cried others, andthere was a fine  shouting and crying out.\"\\nBut the fir-tree remainedquite still, and thought to himself,  \"Shall I have anything to do withall this?\"\\n but he had already amused them as much  as they wished.\"\\nThenthe old man told them the story of Humpty Dumpty, how he fell  downstairs, and was raised up again, and married a princess.\"\\nAnd thechildren clapped  their hands and cried, \"Tell another, tellanother,\" for they wanted to hear the story  of \"Ivede-Avede;\" but theyonly had \"Humpty Dumpty.\"\\n After this the fir-tree became  quitesilent and thoughtful; never had the birds in the forest told suchtales as  \"Humpty Dumpty,\" who fell down stairs, and yet married aprincess.\"\\n \"Ah!\"\\nyes, so it happens in the world,\" thought the fir-tree; hebelieved it all, because  it was related by such a nice man.\"\\n\"Ah!well,\" he thought, \"who knows?\"\\nperhaps I may  fall down too, andmarry a princess;\" and he looked forward joyfully to the next  evening,expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, goldand fruit.\"\\n \"To-morrow I will not tremble,\" thought he; \"I will enjoyall my splendor, and I shall  hear the story of Humpty Dumpty again,and perhaps Ivede-Avede.\"\\n And the tree remained  quiet and thoughtfulall night.\"\\nIn the morning the servants and the housemaid came  in.\"\\nNow,\" thought the fir, \"all my splendor is going to begin again.\"\\n Butthey dragged  him out of the room and up stairs to the garret, andthrew him on the floor, in a dark  corner, where no daylight shone, andthere they left him.\"\\n\"What does this mean?\"\\n  thought the tree, \"what amI to do here?\"\\nI can hear nothing in a place like this,\"  and he hadtime enough to think, for days and nights passed and no one camenear him,  and when at last somebody did come, it was only to putaway large boxes in a corner.\"\\n So the tree was completely hidden fromsight as if it had never existed.\"\\n\"It is winter  now,\" thought thetree, \"the ground is hard and covered with snow, so that people  cannotplant me.\"\\nI shall be sheltered here, I dare say, until spring comes.How  thoughtful and kind everybody is to me!\"\\nStill I wish this placewere not so dark, as  well as lonely, with not even a little hare tolook at.\"\\nHow pleasant it was out in  the forest while the snow lay onthe ground, when the hare would run by, yes, and jump  over me too,although I did not like it then.\"\\nOh!\"\\nit is terrible lonely here.\"\\n  \"Squeak, squeak,\" said a little mouse, creeping cautiously towardsthe tree; then came  another; and they both sniffed at the fir-tree andcrept between the branches.\"\\n \"Oh, it is very cold,\" said the little mouse, \"or else we shouldbe so comfortable  here, shouldn\\'t we, you old fir-tree?\"\\n  \"I am not old,\" said the fir-tree, \"there are many who are olderthan I am.\"\\n  \"Where do you come from?\"\\nand what do you know?\"\\n asked the mice,who were full of  curiosity.\"\\n\"Have you seen the most beautiful placesin the world, and can you tell  us all about them?\"\\nand have you been inthe storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelf,  and hams hang fromthe ceiling?\"\\nOne can run about on tallow candles there, and go in  thinand come out fat.\"\\n  \"I know nothing of that place,\" said the fir-tree, \"but I know thewood where the sun  shines and the birds sing.\"\\n And then the treetold the little mice all about its youth.\"\\n They had never heard such anaccount in their lives; and after they had listened to  it attentively,they said, \"What a number of things you have seen?\"\\nyou must havebeen  very happy.\"\\n  \"Happy!\"\\n exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected uponwhat he had been telling  them, he said, \"Ah, yes!\"\\nafter all those werehappy days.\"\\n But when he went on and  related all aboutChristmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and  lights,the mice said, \"How happy you must have been, you old fir-tree.\"\\n  \"I am not old at all,\" replied the tree, \"I only came from theforest this winter,  I am now checked in my growth.\"\\n  \"What splendid stories you can relate,\" said the little mice.And the next night four  other mice came with them to hear what thetree had to tell.\"\\nThe more he talked the  more he remembered, andthen he thought to himself, \"Those were happy days, but they  maycome again.\"\\nHumpty Dumpty fell down stairs, and yet he married theprincess; perhaps  I may marry a princess too.\"\\n And the fir-treethought of the pretty little birch-tree  that grew in the forest, whichwas to him a real beautiful princess.\"\\n \"Who is Humpty Dumpty?\"\\n asked the little mice.\"\\nAnd then the treerelated the whole  story; he could remember every single word, andthe little mice was so delighted with  it, that they were ready to jumpto the top of the tree.\"\\nThe next night a great many  more mice madetheir appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with them; but theysaid,  it was not a pretty story at all, and the little mice werevery sorry, for it made  them also think less of it.\"\\n \"Do you know only one story?\"\\n asked the rats.\"\\n \"Only one,\" replied the fir-tree; \"I heard it on the happiestevening of my life; but  I did not know I was so happy at the time.\"\\n  \"We think it is a very miserable story,\" said the rats.\"\\n\"Don\\'t youknow any story about  bacon, or tallow in the storeroom.\"\\n  \"No,\" replied the tree.\"\\n \"Many thanks to you then,\" replied the rats, and they marched off.\"\\n The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed,and said, \"It was very  pleasant when the merry little mice sat roundme and listened while I talked.\"\\nNow that  is all passed too.\"\\nHowever, Ishall consider myself happy when some one comes to take  me out of thisplace.\"\\n But would this ever happen?\"\\nYes; one morning people came toclear  out the garret, the boxes were packed away, and the tree waspulled out of the corner,  and thrown roughly on the garret floor; thenthe servant dragged it out upon the  staircase where the daylightshone.\"\\n\"Now life is beginning again,\" said the tree,  rejoicing inthe sunshine and fresh air.\"\\nThen it was carried down stairs andtaken into  the courtyard so quickly, that it forgot to think ofitself, and could only look about,  there was so much to be seen.\"\\nThecourt was close to a garden, where everything looked  blooming.\"\\nFreshand fragrant roses hung over the little palings.\"\\nThe linden-trees  werein blossom; while the swallows flew here and there, crying, \"Twit,twit, twit,  my mate is coming,\"- but it was not the fir-tree theymeant.\"\\n\"Now I shall live,\" cried  the tree, joyfully spreading outits branches; but alas!\"\\nthey were all withered and  yellow, and itlay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles.\"\\nThe star of gold paperstill  stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.\"\\nInthe same courtyard two  of the merry children were playing who haddanced round the tree at Christmas, and  had been so happy.\"\\nTheyoungest saw the gilded star, and ran and pulled it off the  tree.\"\\nLook what is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree,\" said the child,treading on  the branches till they crackled under his boots.\"\\nAnd thetree saw all the fresh bright  flowers in the garden, and then lookedat itself, and wished it had remained in the  dark corner of thegarret.\"\\nIt thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the  merryChristmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to thestory of \"Humpty  Dumpty.\"\\n \"Past!\"\\npast!\"\\n said the old tree; \"Oh, hadI but enjoyed myself while I could  have done so!\"\\nbut now it is toolate.\"\\n Then a lad came and chopped the tree into small  pieces, tilla large bundle lay in a heap on the ground.\"\\nThe pieces were placedin a  fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, whilethe tree sighed so  deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.Then the children, who were at play,  came and seated themselves infront of the fire, and looked at it and cried, \"Pop,  pop.\"\\n But at each\"pop,\" which was a deep sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer day  inthe forest; and of Christmas evening, and of \"Humpty Dumpty,\" the onlystory it had  ever heard or knew how to relate, till at last it wasconsumed.\"\\nThe boys still played  in the garden, and the youngest worethe golden star on his breast, with which the  tree had been adornedduring the happiest evening of its existence.\"\\nNow all was past;  thetree\\'s life was past, and the story also,- for all stories must cometo an end at  last.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE FLAX  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue flowers asdelicate as the wings  of a moth, or even more so.\"\\nThe sun shone, andthe showers watered it; and this was  just as good for the flax as itis for little children to be washed and then kissed  by their mother.They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax.\"\\n \"People say that I look exceedingly well,\" said the flax, \"andthat I am so fine and  long that I shall make a beautiful piece oflinen.\"\\nHow fortunate I am; it makes me  so happy, it is such a pleasantthing to know that something can be made of me.\"\\nHow  the sunshinecheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my  happinessoverpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than I am.\"\\n  \"Ah, yes, no doubt,\" said the fern, \"but you do not know the worldyet as well as I  do, for my sticks are knotty;\" and then it sung quitemournfully-  \"Snip, snap, snurre,  Basse lurre:  The song is ended.\"\\n  \"No, it is not ended,\" said the flax.\"\\n\"To-morrow the sun willshine, or the rain descend.\"\\n I feel that I am growing.\"\\nI feel that I amin full blossom.\"\\nI am the happiest of all  creatures.\"\\n  Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, andpulled it up by the  roots; this was painful; then it was laid in wateras if they intended to drown it;  and, after that, placed near a fireas if it were to be roasted; all this was very  shocking.\"\\n\"We cannotexpect to be happy always,\" said the flax; \"by experiencing evil  aswell as good, we become wise.\"\\n And certainly there was plenty ofevil in store for  the flax.\"\\nIt was steeped, and roasted, and broken,and combed; indeed, it scarcely  knew what was done to it.\"\\nAt last itwas put on the spinning wheel.\"\\n\"Whirr, whirr,\"  went the wheel soquickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts.\"\\n\"Well, I  havebeen very happy,\" he thought in the midst of his pain, \"and must becontented with  the past;\" and contented he remained till he was put onthe loom, and became a beautiful  piece of white linen.\"\\nAll the flax,even to the last stalk, was used in making this  one piece.\"\\n\"Well, thisis quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should  be sofavored by fortune.\"\\nThe fern was not wrong with its song of  \\'Snip, snap, snurre,  Basse lurre.\\'But the song is not ended yet, I am sure; it is only just beginning.How  wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am madesomething of at last; I  am the luckiest person in the world- so strongand fine; and how white, and what a  length!\"\\nThis is somethingdifferent to being a mere plant and bearing flowers.\"\\nThen  I had noattention, nor any water unless it rained; now, I am watched and takencare  of.\"\\nEvery morning the maid turns me over, and I have ashower-bath from the watering-pot  every evening.\"\\nYes, and theclergyman\\'s wife noticed me, and said I was the best piece  of linen inthe whole parish.\"\\nI cannot be happier than I am now.\"\\n  After some time, the linen was taken into the house, placedunder the scissors, and  cut and torn into pieces, and then prickedwith needles.\"\\nThis certainly was not  pleasant; but at last it was madeinto twelve garments of that kind which people do  not like to name,and yet everybody should wear one.\"\\n\"See, now, then,\" said the flax;  \"Ihave become something of importance.\"\\nThis was my destiny; it isquite a blessing.\"\\n Now I shall be of some use in the world, as everyoneought to be; it is the only way  to be happy.\"\\nI am now divided intotwelve pieces, and yet we are all one and the same  in the whole dozen.It is most extraordinary good fortune.\"\\n  Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it couldscarcely hold together.\"\\n \"It must end very soon,\" said the pieces toeach other; \"we would gladly have held  together a little longer, butit is useless to expect impossibilities.\"\\n And at length  they fell intorags and tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they  weretorn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and dried,and they  knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselvesbeautiful white paper.\"\\n \"Well, now, this is a surprise; a glorioussurprise too,\" said the paper.\"\\n\"I am now  finer than ever, and Ishall be written upon, and who can tell what fine things I may  havewritten upon me.\"\\nThis is wonderful luck!\"\\n And sure enough the mostbeautiful  stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once wasthere a blot, which was  very fortunate.\"\\nThen people heard thestories and poetry read, and it made them wiser  and better; for allthat was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great  blessingwas contained in the words on this paper.\"\\n \"I never imagined anything like this,\" said the paper, \"when I wasonly a little blue  flower, growing in the fields.\"\\nHow could I fancythat I should ever be the means of  bringing knowledge and joy toman?\"\\nI cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really  so.\"\\nHeavenknows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was obliged to dowith  my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have beenpromoted from one joy and  honor to another.\"\\nEach time I think that thesong is ended; and then something higher  and better begins for me.\"\\nIsuppose now I shall be sent on my travels about the world,  so thatpeople may read me.\"\\nIt cannot be otherwise; indeed, it is more thanprobable;  for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me, than Ihad pretty flowers in olden  times.\"\\nI am happier than ever.\"\\n  But the paper did not go on its travels; it was sent to theprinter, and all the words  written upon it were set up in type, tomake a book, or rather, many hundreds of books;  for so many morepersons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book, thanfrom  the written paper; and if the paper had been sent around theworld, it would have been  worn out before it had got half throughits journey.\"\\n \"This is certainly the wisest plan,\" said the written paper; \"Ireally did not think  of that.\"\\nI shall remain at home, and be held inhonor, like some old grandfather, as  I really am to all these newbooks.\"\\nThey will do some good.\"\\nI could not have wandered  about as theydo.\"\\nYet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as every word flowedfrom  his pen upon my surface.\"\\nI am the most honored of all.\"\\n  Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers, andthrown into a tub that stood  in the washhouse.\"\\n \"After work, it is well to rest,\" said the paper, \"and a very goodopportunity to  collect one\\'s thoughts.\"\\nNow I am able, for the firsttime, to think of my real condition;  and to know one\\'s self is trueprogress.\"\\nWhat will be done with me now, I wonder?\"\\nNo  doubt I shallstill go forward.\"\\nI have always progressed hitherto, as I know  quitewell.\"\\n  Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was takenout, and laid on the  hearth to be burnt.\"\\nPeople said it could not besold at the shop, to wrap up butter  and sugar, because it had beenwritten upon.\"\\nThe children in the house stood round  the stove; forthey wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up so prettily,and  afterwards, among the ashes, so many red sparks could be seenrunning one after the  other, here and there, as quick as the wind.They called it seeing the children come  out of school, and the lastspark was the schoolmaster.\"\\nThey often thought the last  spark hadcome; and one would cry, \"There goes the schoolmaster;\" but the nextmoment  another spark would appear, shining so beautifully.\"\\nHow theywould like to know where  the sparks all went to!\"\\nPerhaps we shall findout some day, but we don\\'t know now.\"\\n The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and wassoon alight.\"\\n\"Ugh,\"  cried the paper, as it burst into a brightflame; \"ugh.\"\\n It was certainly not very  pleasant to be burning; butwhen the whole was wrapped in flames, the flames mounted  up into theair, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its littleblue flower,  and they glistened as the white linen never could haveglistened.\"\\nAll the written  letters became quite red in a moment, andall the words and thoughts turned to fire.\"\\n \"Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,\" said a voice in theflames; and it was  as if a thousand voices echoed the words; and theflames darted up through the chimney,  and went out at the top.\"\\nThena number of tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers  on theflax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above them.They were even  lighter and more delicate than the flowers from whichthey were born; and as the flames  were extinguished, and nothingremained of the paper but black ashes, these little  beings danced uponit; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.\"\\n \"The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster wasthe last of all,\" said  the children.\"\\nIt was good fun, and they sangover the dead ashes,-  \"Snip, snap, snurre,  Basse lure:  The song is ended.\"\\n  But the little invisible beings said, \"The song is never ended;the most beautiful  is yet to come.\"\\n  But the children could neither hear nor understand this, norshould they; for children  must not know everything.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE FLYING TRUNK  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have pavedthe whole street  with gold, and would even then have had enough fora small alley.\"\\nBut he did not do  so; he knew the value of money betterthan to use it in this way.\"\\nSo clever was he,  that every shilling heput out brought him a crown; and so he continued till he died.\"\\n His soninherited his wealth, and he lived a merry life with it; he went toa masquerade  every night, made kites out of five pound notes, andthrew pieces of gold into the  sea instead of stones, making ducksand drakes of them.\"\\nIn this manner he soon lost  all his money.\"\\nAt lasthe had nothing left but a pair of slippers, an old  dressing-gown,and four shillings.\"\\nAnd now all his friends deserted him, they couldnot  walk with him in the streets; but one of them, who was verygood-natured, sent him  an old trunk with this message, \"Pack up!\"\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it is all very well to  say \\'pack up,\\' \"but he hadnothing left to pack up, therefore he seated himself in  the trunk.It was a very wonderful trunk; no sooner did any one press on the lockthan  the trunk could fly.\"\\nHe shut the lid and pressed the lock, whenaway flew the trunk  up the chimney with the merchant\\'s son in it,right up into the clouds.\"\\nWhenever the  bottom of the trunk cracked, hewas in a great fright, for if the trunk fell to pieces  he would havemade a tremendous somerset over the trees.\"\\nHowever, he got safely inhis  trunk to the land of Turkey.\"\\nHe hid the trunk in the wood undersome dry leaves, and  then went into the town: he could so this verywell, for the Turks always go about  dressed in dressing-gowns andslippers, as he was himself.\"\\nHe happened to meet a nurse  with a littlechild.\"\\n\"I say, you Turkish nurse,\" cried he, \"what castle is that nearthe  town, with the windows placed so high?\"\\n  \"The king\\'s daughter lives there,\" she replied; \"it has beenprophesied that she will  be very unhappy about a lover, andtherefore no one is allowed to visit her, unless  the king and queenare present.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said the merchant\\'s son.\"\\nSo he went back to the wood,seated himself in  his trunk, flew up to the roof of the castle, andcrept through the window into the  princess\\'s room.\"\\nShe lay on the sofaasleep, and she was so beautiful that the  merchant\\'s son could nothelp kissing her.\"\\nThen she awoke, and was very much frightened;  but hetold her he was a Turkish angel, who had come down through the airto see her,  which pleased her very much.\"\\nHe sat down by her side andtalked to her: he said her  eyes were like beautiful dark lakes, inwhich the thoughts swam about like little  mermaids, and he told herthat her forehead was a snowy mountain, which contained  splendid hallsfull of pictures.\"\\nAnd then he related to her about the stork whobrings  the beautiful children from the rivers.\"\\nThese were delightfulstories; and when he  asked the princess if she would marry him, sheconsented immediately.\"\\n \"But you must come on Saturday,\" she said; \"for then the kingand queen will take tea  with me.\"\\nThey will be very proud when theyfind that I am going to marry a Turkish  angel; but you must think ofsome very pretty stories to tell them, for my parents  like to hearstories better than anything.\"\\nMy mother prefers one that is deep andmoral;  but my father likes something funny, to make him laugh.\"\\n  \"Very well,\" he replied; \"I shall bring you no other marriageportion than a story,\"  and so they parted.\"\\nBut the princess gave him asword which was studded with gold coins,  and these he could use.\"\\n Then he flew away to the town and bought a new dressing-gown,and afterwards returned  to the wood, where he composed a story, soas to be ready for Saturday, which was no  easy matter.\"\\nIt was readyhowever by Saturday, when he went to see the princess.\"\\nThe  king, andqueen, and the whole court, were at tea with the princess; and hewas received  with great politeness.\"\\n \"Will you tell us a story?\"\\n said the queen,- \"one that isinstructive and full of deep  learning.\"\\n  \"Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,\" said the king.\"\\n \"Certainly,\" he replied, and commenced at once, asking them tolisten attentively.\"\\n \"There was once a bundle of matches that wereexceedingly proud of their high descent.\"\\n Their genealogical tree, thatis, a large pine-tree from which they had been cut, was  at one timea large, old tree in the wood.\"\\nThe matches now lay between atinder-box  and an old iron saucepan, and were talking about theiryouthful days.\"\\n\\'Ah!\"\\nthen we  grew on the green boughs, and were asgreen as they; every morning and evening we were  fed with diamonddrops of dew.\"\\nWhenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and  thelittle birds would relate stories to us as they sung.\"\\nWe knew thatwe were rich,  for the other trees only wore their green dress insummer, but our family were able  to array themselves in green,summer and winter.\"\\nBut the wood-cutter came, like a  greatrevolution, and our family fell under the axe.\"\\nThe head of the houseobtained  a situation as mainmast in a very fine ship, and can sailround the world when he will.\"\\n The other branches of the family weretaken to different places, and our office now  is to kindle a light forcommon people.\"\\nThis is how such high-born people as we came  to be in akitchen.\\'  \"\\'Mine has been a very different fate,\\' said the iron pot, whichstood by the matches;  \\'from my first entrance into the world I havebeen used to cooking and scouring.\"\\nI  am the first in this house,when anything solid or useful is required.\"\\nMy only pleasure  is to bemade clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my place and have alittle  sensible conversation with my neighbors.\"\\nAll of us, exceptingthe water-bucket, which  is sometimes taken into the courtyard, livehere together within these four walls.\"\\n We get our news from themarket-basket, but he sometimes tells us very unpleasant  thingsabout the people and the government.\"\\nYes, and one day an old pot wasso alarmed,  that he fell down and was broken to pieces.\"\\nHe was aliberal, I can tell you.\\'  \"\\'You are talking too much,\\' said the tinder-box, and the steelstruck against the  flint till some sparks flew out, crying, \\'We want amerry evening, don\\'t we?\\'  \"\\'Yes, of course,\\' said the matches, \\'let us talk about thosewho are the highest born.\\'  \"\\'No, I don\\'t like to be always talking of what we are,\\'remarked the saucepan; \\'let  us think of some other amusement; I willbegin.\"\\nWe will tell something that has happened  to ourselves; thatwill be very easy, and interesting as well.\"\\nOn the Baltic Sea,  nearthe Danish shore\\'- \"\\'What a pretty commencement!\\' said the plates; \\'we shall  alllike that story, I am sure.\\'  \"\\'Yes; well in my youth, I lived in a quiet family, where thefurniture was polished,  the floors scoured, and clean curtains putup every fortnight,\\'  \"\\'What an interesting way you have of relating a story,\\' saidthe carpet-broom; \\'it  is easy to perceive that you have been a greatdeal in women\\'s society, there is  something so pure runs throughwhat you say.\\'  \"\\'That is quite true,\\' said the water-bucket; and he made a springwith joy, and  splashed some water on the floor.\"\\n \"Then the saucepan went on with his story, and the end was as goodas the beginning.\"\\n \"The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom broughtsome green parsley  out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan,for he knew it would vex the others;  and he thought, \\'If I crown himto-day he will crown me to-morrow.\\'  \"\\'Now, let us have a dance,\\' said the fire-tongs; and then howthey danced and stuck  up one leg in the air.\"\\nThe chair-cushion inthe corner burst with laughter when she  saw it.\"\\n \"\\'Shall I be crowned now?\\' asked the fire-tongs; so the broomfound another wreath  for the tongs.\"\\n \"\\'They were only common people after all,\\' thought the matches.The tea-urn was now  asked to sing, but she said she had a cold, andcould not sing without boiling heat.\"\\n They all thought this wasaffectation, and because she did not wish to sing excepting  in theparlor, when on the table with the grand people.\"\\n \"In the window sat an old quill-pen, with which the maid generallywrote.\"\\nThere was  nothing remarkable about the pen, excepting that ithad been dipped too deeply in the  ink, but it was proud of that.\"\\n \"\\'If the tea-urn won\\'t sing,\\' said the pen, \\'she can leave italone; there is a  nightingale in a cage who can sing; she has not beentaught much, certainly, but we  need not say anything this eveningabout that.\\'  \"\\'I think it highly improper,\\' said the tea-kettle, who waskitchen singer, and  half-brother to the tea-urn, \\'that a richforeign bird should be listened to here.\"\\n Is it patriotic?\"\\nLet themarket-basket decide what is right.\\'  \"\\'I certainly am vexed,\\' said the basket; \\'inwardly vexed, morethan any one can  imagine.\"\\nAre we spending the evening properly?Would it not be more sensible to put  the house in order?\"\\nIf eachwere in his own place I would lead a game; this would be  quite anotherthing.\\'  \"\\'Let us act a play,\\' said they all.\"\\nAt the same moment the dooropened, and the maid  came in.\"\\nThen not one stirred; they allremained quite still; yet, at the same time,  there was not a singlepot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself, and  of what hecould do if he chose.\"\\n \"\\'Yes, if we had chosen,\\' they each thought, \\'we might havespent a very pleasant  evening.\\'  \"The maid took the matches and lighted them; dear me, how theysputtered and blazed  up!\"\\n \"\\'Now then,\\' they thought, \\'every one will see that we are thefirst.\"\\nHow we shine;  what a light we give!\\' Even while they spoketheir light went out.\"\\n \"What a capital story,\" said the queen, \"I feel as if I werereally in the kitchen,  and could see the matches; yes, you shall marryour daughter.\"\\n  \"Certainly,\" said the king, \"thou shalt have our daughter.\"\\n Theking said thou to him  because he was going to be one of the family.The wedding-day was fixed, and, on the  evening before, the wholecity was illuminated.\"\\nCakes and sweetmeats were thrown among  thepeople.\"\\nThe street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted \"hurrah,\" andwhistled between  their fingers; altogether it was a very splendidaffair.\"\\n \"I will give them another treat,\" said the merchant\\'s son.\"\\nSo hewent and bought rockets  and crackers, and all sorts of fire-works thatcould be thought of, packed them in  his trunk, and flew up with itinto the air.\"\\nWhat a whizzing and popping they made  as they wentoff!\"\\nThe Turks, when they saw such a sight in the air, jumped sohigh that  their slippers flew about their ears.\"\\nIt was easy to believeafter this that the  princess was really going to marry a Turkishangel.\"\\n As soon as the merchant\\'s son had come down in his flying trunk tothe wood after the  fireworks, he thought, \"I will go back into thetown now, and hear what they think  of the entertainment.\"\\n It wasvery natural that he should wish to know.\"\\nAnd what strange  thingspeople did say, to be sure!\"\\nevery one whom he questioned had adifferent tale  to tell, though they all thought it very beautiful.\"\\n \"\\'I saw the Turkish angel myself,\" said one; \"he had eyes likeglittering stars, and  a head like foaming water.\"\\n  \"He flew in a mantle of fire,\" cried another, \"and lovely littlecherubs peeped out  from the folds.\"\\n  He heard many more fine things about himself, and that the nextday he was to be married.\"\\n After this he went back to the forest torest himself in his trunk.\"\\nIt had disappeared!\"\\n A spark from thefireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt to ashes!\"\\n Sothe merchant\\'s son could not fly any more, nor go to meet his bride.She stood all  day on the roof waiting for him, and most likely sheis waiting there still; while  he wanders through the world tellingfairy tales, but none of them so amusing as the  one he related aboutthe matches.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE GARDEN OF PARADISE  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a king\\'s son who had a larger and more beautifulcollection of books  than any one else in the world, and full ofsplendid copper-plate engravings.\"\\nHe could  read and obtain informationrespecting every people of every land; but not a word could  he find toexplain the situation of the garden of paradise, and this was justwhat he  most wished to know.\"\\nHis grandmother had told him when hewas quite a little boy, just  old enough to go to school, that eachflower in the garden of paradise was a sweet  cake, that the pistilswere full of rich wine, that on one flower history was written,  onanother geography or tables; so those who wished to learn theirlessons had only  to eat some of the cakes, and the more they ate,the more history, geography, or tables  they knew.\"\\nHe believed it allthen; but as he grew older, and learnt more and more,  he became wiseenough to understand that the splendor of the garden of paradisemust  be very different to all this.\"\\n\"Oh, why did Eve pluck the fruitfrom the tree of  knowledge?\"\\nwhy did Adam eat the forbidden fruit?\"\\nthought the king\\'s son: \"if I had  been there it would never havehappened, and there would have been no sin in the world.\"\\n  The gardenof paradise occupied all his thoughts till he reached hisseventeenth year.\"\\n One day he was walking alone in the wood, which was his greatestpleasure, when evening  came on.\"\\nThe clouds gathered, and the rainpoured down as if the sky had been a  waterspout; and it was as dark asthe bottom of a well at midnight; sometimes he slipped  over the smoothgrass, or fell over stones that projected out of the rocky ground.Every  thing was dripping with moisture, and the poor prince had nota dry thread about him.\"\\n He was obliged at last to climb over greatblocks of stone, with water spurting from  the thick moss.\"\\nHe beganto feel quite faint, when he heard a most singular rushing  noise,and saw before him a large cave, from which came a blaze of light.In the middle  of the cave an immense fire was burning, and a noblestag, with its branching horns,  was placed on a spit between thetrunks of two pine-trees.\"\\nIt was turning slowly before  the fire, andan elderly woman, as large and strong as if she had been a man indisguise,  sat by, throwing one piece of wood after another into theflames.\"\\n \"Come in,\" she said to the prince; \"sit down by the fire and dryyourself.\"\\n  \"There is a great draught here,\" said the prince, as he seatedhimself on the ground.\"\\n \"It will be worse when my sons come home,\" replied the woman; \"youare now in the cavern  of the Winds, and my sons are the four Windsof heaven: can you understand that?\"\\n  \"Where are your sons?\"\\n asked the prince.\"\\n \"It is difficult to answer stupid questions,\" said the woman.\"\\nMy sons have plenty  of business on hand; they are playing atshuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the  king\\'s hall,\" and shepointed upwards.\"\\n \"Oh, indeed,\" said the prince; \"but you speak more roughly andharshly and are not  so gentle as the women I am used to.\"\\n  \"Yes, that is because they have nothing else to do; but I amobliged to be harsh, to  keep my boys in order, and I can do it,although they are so head-strong.\"\\nDo you see  those four sackshanging on the wall?\"\\nWell, they are just as much afraid of thosesacks,  as you used to be of the rat behind the looking-glass.\"\\nI canbend the boys together,  and put them in the sacks without anyresistance on their parts, I can tell you.\"\\nThere  they stay, and darenot attempt to come out until I allow them to do so.\"\\nAnd here  comesone of them.\"\\n  It was the North Wind who came in, bringing with him a cold,piercing blast; large  hailstones rattled on the floor, andsnowflakes were scattered around in all  directions.\"\\nHe wore a bearskindress and cloak.\"\\nHis sealskin cap was drawn over his  ears, longicicles hung from his beard, and one hailstone after another rolledfrom  the collar of his jacket.\"\\n \"Don\\'t go too near the fire,\" said the prince, \"or your handsand face will be  frost-bitten.\"\\n  \"Frost-bitten!\"\\n said the North Wind, with a loud laugh; \"why frostis my greatest  delight.\"\\nWhat sort of a little snip are you, and howdid you find your way to the cavern  of the Winds?\"\\n  \"He is my guest,\" said the old woman, \"and if you are notsatisfied with that  explanation you can go into the sack.\"\\nDo youunderstand me?\"\\n  That settled the matter.\"\\nSo the North Wind began to relate hisadventures, whence he  came, and where he had been for a whole month.\"\\nI come from the polar seas,\" he said;  \"I have been on the Bear\\'sIsland with the Russian walrus-hunters.\"\\nI sat and slept  at the helm oftheir ship, as they sailed away from North Cape.\"\\nSometimes when Iwoke,  the storm-birds would fly about my legs.\"\\nThey are curious birds;they give one flap  with their wings, and then on their outstretchedpinions soar far away.\"\\n \"Don\\'t make such a long story of it,\" said the mother of thewinds; \"what sort of a  place is Bear\\'s Island?\"\\n  \"A very beautiful place, with a floor for dancing as smooth andflat as a plate.\"\\n Half-melted snow, partly covered with moss, sharpstones, and skeletons of walruses  and polar-bears, lie all about,their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay.\"\\nIt  would seem as ifthe sun never shone there.\"\\nI blew gently, to clear away the mist,and  then I saw a little hut, which had been built from the wood of awreck, and was covered  with the skins of the walrus, the fleshy sideoutwards; it looked green and red, and  on the roof sat a growlingbear.\"\\nThen I went to the sea shore, to look after birds\\'  nests, andsaw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths and screaming forfood.\"\\n I blew into the thousand little throats, and quickly stoppedtheir screaming.\"\\nFarther  on were the walruses with pig\\'s heads, andteeth a yard long, rolling about like great  worms.\"\\n \"You relate your adventures very well, my son,\" said the mother,\"it makes my mouth  water to hear you.\"\\n \"After that,\" continued the North Wind, \"the hunting commenced.The harpoon was flung  into the breast of the walrus, so that a smokingstream of blood spurted forth like  a fountain, and besprinkled theice.\"\\nThen I thought of my own game; I began to blow,  and set my ownships, the great icebergs sailing, so that they might crush the boats.Oh,  how the sailors howled and cried out!\"\\nbut I howled louder thanthey.\"\\nThey were obliged  to unload their cargo, and throw theirchests and the dead walruses on the ice.\"\\nThen  I sprinkled snow overthem, and left them in their crushed boats to drift southward,  andto taste salt water.\"\\nThey will never return to Bear\\'s Island.\"\\n  \"So you have done mischief,\" said the mother of the Winds.\"\\n \"I shall leave others to tell the good I have done,\" he replied.\"\\nBut here comes my  brother from the West; I like him best of all,for he has the smell of the sea about  him, and brings in a cold, freshair as he enters.\"\\n  \"Is that the little Zephyr?\"\\n asked the prince.\"\\n \"Yes, it is the little Zephyr,\" said the old woman; \"but he is notlittle now.\"\\nIn years  gone by he was a beautiful boy; now that is allpast.\"\\n  He came in, looking like a wild man, and he wore a slouched hat toprotect his head  from injury.\"\\nIn his hand he carried a club, cutfrom a mahogany tree in the American  forests, not a trifle to carry.\"\\n \"Whence do you come?\"\\n asked the mother.\"\\n \"I come from the wilds of the forests, where the thorny bramblesform thick hedges  between the trees; where the water-snake lies in thewet grass, and mankind seem to  be unknown.\"\\n  \"What were you doing there?\"\\n  \"I looked into the deep river, and saw it rushing down from therocks.\"\\nThe water drops  mounted to the clouds and glittered in therainbow.\"\\nI saw the wild buffalo swimming  in the river, but thestrong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks,  whichflew into the air as the waters dashed onwards, leaving the buffalo tobe hurled  over the waterfall.\"\\nThis pleased me; so I raised a storm,which rooted up old trees,  and sent them floating down the river.\"\\n  \"And what else have you done?\"\\n asked the old woman.\"\\n \"I have rushed wildly across the savannahs; I have stroked thewild horses, and shaken  the cocoa-nuts from the trees.\"\\nYes, I havemany stories to relate; but I need not tell  everything I know.\"\\nYouknow it all very well, don\\'t you, old lady?\"\\n And he kissed  hismother so roughly, that she nearly fell backwards.\"\\nOh, he was, indeed,a wild  fellow.\"\\n Now in came the South Wind, with a turban and a flowing Bedouincloak.\"\\n \"How cold it is here!\"\\n said he, throwing more wood on the fire.\"\\nIt is easy to feel  that the North Wind has arrived here before me.\"\\n  \"Why it is hot enough here to roast a bear,\" said the North Wind.\"\\n \"You are a bear yourself,\" said the other.\"\\n \"Do you want to be put in the sack, both of you?\"\\n said the oldwoman.\"\\n\"Sit down, now,  on that stone, yonder, and tell me where youhave been.\"\\n  \"In Africa, mother.\"\\nI went out with the Hottentots, who werelion-hunting in the Kaffir  land, where the plains are covered withgrass the color of a green olive; and here  I ran races with theostrich, but I soon outstripped him in swiftness.\"\\nAt last I came  tothe desert, in which lie the golden sands, looking like the bottomof the sea.\"\\nHere  I met a caravan, and the travellers had just killedtheir last camel, to obtain water;  there was very little for them, andthey continued their painful journey beneath the  burning sun, and overthe hot sands, which stretched before them a vast, boundless  desert.Then I rolled myself in the loose sand, and whirled it in burningcolumns over  their heads.\"\\nThe dromedarys stood still in terror,while the merchants drew their  caftans over their heads, and threwthemselves on the ground before me, as they do  before Allah, theirgod.\"\\nThen I buried them beneath a pyramid of sand, which covers  themall.\"\\nWhen I blow that away on my next visit, the sun will bleach theirbones, and  travellers will see that others have been there beforethem; otherwise, in such a wild  desert, they might not believe itpossible.\"\\n  \"So you have done nothing but evil,\" said the mother.\"\\n\"Into thesack with you;\" and,  before he was aware, she had seized the SouthWind round the body, and popped him into  the bag.\"\\nHe rolled about onthe floor, till she sat herself upon him to keep him still.\"\\n \"These boys of yours are very lively,\" said the prince.\"\\n \"Yes,\" she replied, \"but I know how to correct them, whennecessary; and here comes  the fourth.\"\\n In came the East Wind,dressed like a Chinese.\"\\n \"Oh, you come from that quarter, do you?\"\\n said she; \"I thought youhad been to the  garden of paradise.\"\\n  \"I am going there to-morrow,\" he replied; \"I have not been therefor a hundred years.\"\\n I have just come from China, where I danced roundthe porcelain tower till all the  bells jingled again.\"\\nIn the streetsan official flogging was taking place, and bamboo  canes were beingbroken on the shoulders of men of every high position, from thefirst  to the ninth grade.\"\\nThey cried, \\'Many thanks, my fatherlybenefactor;\\' but I am sure  the words did not come from their hearts,so I rang the bells till they sounded, \\'ding,  ding-dong.\\'\"  \"You are a wild boy,\" said the old woman; \"it is well for you thatyou are going  to-morrow to the garden of paradise; you always getimproved in your education there.\"\\n Drink deeply from the fountain ofwisdom while you are there, and bring home a bottleful  for me.\"\\n  \"That I will,\" said the East Wind; \"but why have you put mybrother South in a bag?\"\\n Let him out; for I want him to tell me aboutthe phoenix-bird.\"\\nThe princess always  wants to hear of this birdwhen I pay her my visit every hundred years.\"\\nIf you will  open thesack, sweetest mother, I will give you two pocketfuls of tea, greenand fresh  as when I gathered it from the spot where it grew.\"\\n  \"Well, for the sake of the tea, and because you are my own boy,I will open the bag.\"\\n  She did so, and the South Wind crept out, looking quite cast down,because the prince  had seen his disgrace.\"\\n \"There is a palm-leaf for the princess,\" he said.\"\\n\"The oldphoenix, the only one in  the world, gave it to me himself.\"\\nHe hasscratched on it with his beak the whole of  his history during thehundred years he has lived.\"\\nShe can there read how the old  phoenix setfire to his own nest, and sat upon it while it was burning, like aHindoo  widow.\"\\nThe dry twigs around the nest crackled and smoked tillthe flames burst forth  and consumed the phoenix to ashes.\"\\nAmidst thefire lay an egg, red hot, which presently  burst with a loud report,and out flew a young bird.\"\\nHe is the only phoenix in the  world, andthe king over all the other birds.\"\\nHe has bitten a hole in the leafwhich  I give you, and that is his greeting to the princess.\"\\n  \"Now let us have something to eat,\" said the mother of theWinds.\"\\nSo they all sat down  to feast on the roasted stag; and as theprince sat by the side of the East Wind, they  soon became goodfriends.\"\\n \"Pray tell me,\" said the prince, \"who is that princess of whom youhave been talking!\"\\n and where lies the garden of paradise?\"\\n  \"Ho!\"\\nho!\"\\n said the East Wind, \"would you like to go there?\"\\nWell,you can fly off with  me to-morrow; but I must tell you one thing- nohuman being has been there since the  time of Adam and Eve.\"\\nI supposeyou have read of them in your Bible.\"\\n  \"Of course I have,\" said the prince.\"\\n \"Well,\" continued the East Wind, \"when they were driven out of thegarden of paradise,  it sunk into the earth; but it retained its warmsunshine, its balmy air, and all its  splendor.\"\\nThe fairy queen livesthere, in the island of happiness, where death never  comes, and all isbeautiful.\"\\nI can manage to take you there to-morrow, if you will  siton my back.\"\\nBut now don\\'t talk any more, for I want to go to sleep;\"and then they  all slept.\"\\n When the prince awoke in the early morning, he was not a littlesurprised at finding  himself high up above the clouds.\"\\nHe was seatedon the back of the East Wind, who held  him faithfully; and they wereso high in the air that woods and fields, rivers and  lakes, as theylay beneath them, looked like a painted map.\"\\n \"Good morning,\" said the East Wind.\"\\n\"You might have slept on awhile; for there is  very little to see in the flat country overwhich we are passing unless you like to  count the churches; theylook like spots of chalk on a green board.\"\\n The green board  was thename he gave to the green fields and meadows.\"\\n \"It was very rude of me not to say good-bye to your mother andyour brothers,\" said  the prince.\"\\n \"They will excuse you, as you were asleep,\" said the East Wind;and then they flew  on faster than ever.\"\\n The leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they passed.When they flew over seas  and lakes, the waves rose higher, and thelarge ships dipped into the water like diving  swans.\"\\nAs darknesscame on, towards evening, the great towns looked charming; lights  weresparkling, now seen now hidden, just as the sparks go out one afteranother on  a piece of burnt paper.\"\\nThe prince clapped his hands withpleasure; but the East Wind  advised him not to express hisadmiration in that manner, or he might fall down, and  find himselfhanging on a church steeple.\"\\nThe eagle in the dark forests fliesswiftly;  but faster than he flew the East Wind.\"\\nThe Cossack, on hissmall horse, rides lightly  o\\'er the plains; but lighter still passedthe prince on the winds of the wind.\"\\n \"There are the Himalayas, the highest mountains in Asia,\" said theEast Wind.\"\\n\"We shall  soon reach the garden of paradise now.\"\\n  Then, they turned southward, and the air became fragrant withthe perfume of spices  and flowers.\"\\nHere figs and pomegranates grewwild, and the vines were covered with  clusters of blue and purplegrapes.\"\\nHere they both descended to the earth, and  stretchedthemselves on the soft grass, while the flowers bowed to the breath ofthe  wind as if to welcome it.\"\\n\"Are we now in the garden ofparadise?\"\\n asked the prince.\"\\n \"No, indeed,\" replied the East Wind; \"but we shall be there verysoon.\"\\nDo you see that  wall of rocks, and the cavern beneath it, overwhich the grape vines hang like a green  curtain?\"\\nThrough that cavernwe must pass.\"\\nWrap your cloak round you; for while the  sun scorchesyou here, a few steps farther it will be icy cold.\"\\nThe bird flyingpast  the entrance to the cavern feels as if one wing were in theregion of summer, and the  other in the depths of winter.\"\\n  \"So this then is the way to the garden of paradise?\"\\n asked theprince, as they entered  the cavern.\"\\nIt was indeed cold; but the coldsoon passed, for the East Wind spread  his wings, and they gleamed likethe brightest fire.\"\\nAs they passed on through this  wonderful cave, theprince could see great blocks of stone, from which water  trickled,hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes.\"\\nSometimes it was sonarrow that  they had to creep on their hands and knees, while at othertimes it was lofty and wide,  like the free air.\"\\nIt had theappearance of a chapel for the dead, with petrified organs  andsilent pipes.\"\\n\"We seem to be passing through the valley of death tothe garden of  paradise,\" said the prince.\"\\n But the East Wind answered not a word, only pointed forwards toa lovely blue light  which gleamed in the distance.\"\\nThe blocks of stoneassumed a misty appearance, till  at last they looked like white cloudsin moonlight.\"\\nThe air was fresh and balmy, like  a breeze from themountains perfumed with flowers from a valley of roses.\"\\nA river,  clearas the air itself, sparkled at their feet, while in its clear depthscould be  seen gold and silver fish sporting in the bright water, andpurple eels emitting sparks  of fire at every moment, while the broadleaves of the water-lilies, that floated on  its surface, flickeredwith all the colors of the rainbow.\"\\nThe flower in its color  of flameseemed to receive its nourishment from the water, as a lamp issustained by  oil.\"\\nA marble bridge, of such exquisite workmanshipthat it appeared as if formed of  lace and pearls, led to the island ofhappiness, in which bloomed the garden of paradise.\"\\n The East Wind tookthe prince in his arms, and carried him over, while the flowers  andthe leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in tones so fulland soft that  no human voice could venture to imitate.\"\\nWithin thegarden grew large trees, full of  sap; but whether they were palm-treesor gigantic water-plants, the prince knew not.\"\\n The climbing plantshung in garlands of green and gold, like the illuminations on  themargins of old missals or twined among the initial letters.\"\\nBirds,flowers, and  festoons appeared intermingled in seeming confusion.Close by, on the grass, stood  a group of peacocks, with radianttails outspread to the sun.\"\\nThe prince touched them,  and found, to hissurprise, that they were not really birds, but the leaves of  theburdock tree, which shone with the colors of a peacock\\'s tail.\"\\nThelion and the  tiger, gentle and tame, were springing about like playfulcats among the green bushes,  whose perfume was like the fragrantblossom of the olive.\"\\nThe plumage of the  wood-pigeon glistened likepearls as it struck the lion\\'s mane with its wings; while  theantelope, usually so shy, stood near, nodding its head as if it wishedto join in  the frolic.\"\\nThe fairy of paradise next made her appearance.Her raiment shone like  the sun, and her serene countenance beamed withhappiness like that of a mother  rejoicing over her child.\"\\nShe wasyoung and beautiful, and a train of lovely maidens  followed her,each wearing a bright star in her hair.\"\\nThe East Wind gave her  thepalm-leaf, on which was written the history of the phoenix; and hereyes sparkled  with joy.\"\\nShe then took the prince by the hand, andled him into her palace, the walls  of which were richly colored,like a tulip-leaf when it is turned to the sun.\"\\nThe roof  had theappearance of an inverted flower, and the colors grew deeper andbrighter to  the gazer.\"\\nThe prince walked to a window, and saw whatappeared to be the tree of  knowledge of good and evil, with Adam andEve standing by, and the serpent near them.\"\\n \"I thought they werebanished from paradise,\" he said.\"\\n The princess smiled, and told him that time had engraved eachevent on a window-pane  in the form of a picture; but, unlike otherpictures, all that it represented lived  and moved,- the leavesrustled, and the persons went and came, as in a looking-glass.\"\\n Helooked through another pane, and saw the ladder in Jacob\\'s dream, onwhich the angels  were ascending and descending with outspread wings.All that had ever happened in the  world here lived and moved on thepanes of glass, in pictures such as time alone could  produce.\"\\nThefairy now led the prince into a large, lofty room with transparentwalls,  through which the light shone.\"\\nHere were portraits, each oneappearing more beautiful  than the other- millions of happy beings,whose laughter and song mingled in one sweet  melody: some of thesewere in such an elevated position that they appeared smaller  thanthe smallest rosebud, or like pencil dots on paper.\"\\nIn the centre ofthe hall stood  a tree, with drooping branches, from which hunggolden apples, both great and small,  looking like oranges amid thegreen leaves.\"\\nIt was the tree of knowledge of good and  evil, fromwhich Adam and Eve had plucked and eaten the forbidden fruit, and fromeach  leaf trickled a bright red dewdrop, as if the tree were weepingtears of blood for  their sin.\"\\n\"Let us now take the boat,\" said thefairy: \"a sail on the cool waters will  refresh us.\"\\nBut we shall notmove from the spot, although the boat may rock on the  swellingwater; the countries of the world will glide before us, but we shallremain  still.\"\\n  It was indeed wonderful to behold.\"\\nFirst came the lofty Alps,snow-clad, and covered  with clouds and dark pines.\"\\nThe horn resounded,and the shepherds sang merrily in the  valleys.\"\\nThe banana-trees benttheir drooping branches over the boat, black swans  floated on thewater, and singular animals and flowers appeared on the distant  shore.New Holland, the fifth division of the world, now glided by, withmountains in  the background, looking blue in the distance.\"\\nTheyheard the song of the priests, and  saw the wild dance of the savage tothe sound of the drums and trumpets of bone; the  pyramids of Egyptrising to the clouds; columns and sphinxes, overthrown and buried  inthe sand, followed in their turn; while the northern lights flashedout over the  extinguished volcanoes of the north, in fireworks nonecould imitate.\"\\n The prince was delighted, and yet he saw hundreds of otherwonderful things more than  can be described.\"\\n\"Can I stay hereforever?\"\\n asked he.\"\\n \"That depends upon yourself,\" replied the fairy.\"\\n\"If you do not,like Adam, long for  what is forbidden, you can remain here always.\"\\n  \"I should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge,\" saidthe prince; there is  abundance of fruit equally beautiful.\"\\n  \"Examine your own heart,\" said the princess, \"and if you do notfeel sure of its  strength, return with the East Wind who broughtyou.\"\\nHe is about to fly back, and will  not return here for a hundredyears.\"\\nThe time will not seem to you more than a hundred  hours, yeteven that is a long time for temptation and resistance.\"\\nEvery evening,when  I leave you, I shall be obliged to say, \\'Come with me,\\' and tobeckon to you with my  hand.\"\\nBut you must not listen, nor move fromyour place to follow me; for with every  step you will find yourpower to resist weaker.\"\\nIf once you attempted to follow me,  youwould soon find yourself in the hall, where grows the tree ofknowledge, for I sleep  beneath its perfumed branches.\"\\nIf you stoopedover me, I should be forced to smile.\"\\n If you then kissed my lips,the garden of paradise would sink into the earth, and to  you itwould be lost.\"\\nA keen wind from the desert would howl around you; coldrain fall  on your head, and sorrow and woe be your future lot.\"\\n  \"I will remain,\" said the prince.\"\\n So the East Wind kissed him on the forehead, and said, \"Be firm;then shall we meet  again when a hundred years have passed.\"\\nFarewell,farewell.\"\\n Then the East Wind spread  his broad pinions, which shonelike the lightning in harvest, or as the northern lights  in a coldwinter.\"\\n \"Farewell, farewell,\" echoed the trees and the flowers.\"\\n Storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands, to accompanyhim to the  boundaries of the garden.\"\\n \"Now we will commence dancing,\" said the fairy; and when it isnearly over at sunset,  while I am dancing with you, I shall make asign, and ask you to follow me: but do  not obey.\"\\nI shall be obliged torepeat the same thing for a hundred years; and each  time, when thetrial is past, if you resist, you will gain strength, tillresistance  becomes easy, and at last the temptation will be quiteovercome.\"\\nThis evening, as it  will be the first time, I have warnedyou.\"\\n  After this the fairy led him into a large hall, filled withtransparent lilies.\"\\nThe  yellow stamina of each flower formed a tinygolden harp, from which came forth strains  of music like the mingledtones of flute and lyre.\"\\nBeautiful maidens, slender and  graceful inform, and robed in transparent gauze, floated through the dance, andsang  of the happy life in the garden of paradise, where death neverentered, and where all  would bloom forever in immortal youth.\"\\nAs thesun went down, the whole heavens became  crimson and gold, and tintedthe lilies with the hue of roses.\"\\nThen the beautiful  maidens offeredto the prince sparkling wine; and when he had drank, he felt  happinessgreater than he had ever known before.\"\\nPresently the background of thehall  opened and the tree of knowledge appeared, surrounded by a haloof glory that almost  blinded him.\"\\nVoices, soft and lovely as hismother\\'s sounded in his ears, as if she  were singing to him, \"Mychild, my beloved child.\"\\n Then the fairy beckoned to him,  and saidin sweet accents, \"Come with me, come with me.\"\\n Forgetting hispromise,  forgetting it even on the very first evening, he rushedtowards her, while she  continued to beckon to him and to smile.\"\\nThefragrance around him overpowered his  senses, the music from theharps sounded more entrancing, while around the tree  appeared millionsof smiling faces, nodding and singing.\"\\n\"Man should know  everything;man is the lord of the earth.\"\\n The tree of knowledge no longer wepttears  of blood, for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars.\"\\n \"Come, come,\" continued that thrilling voice, and the princefollowed the call.\"\\nAt  every step his cheeks glowed, and the bloodrushed wildly through his veins.\"\\n\"I must  follow,\" he cried; \"it is nota sin, it cannot be, to follow beauty and joy.\"\\nI only  want to seeher sleep, and nothing will happen unless I kiss her, and that Iwill not  do, for I have strength to resist, and a determined will.\"\\n  The fairy threw off her dazzling attire, bent back the boughs, andin another moment  was hidden among them.\"\\n \"I have not sinned yet,\" said the prince, \"and I will not;\" andthen he pushed aside  the boughs to follow the princess.\"\\nShe waslying already asleep, beautiful as only  a fairy in the garden ofparadise could be.\"\\nShe smiled as he bent over her, and he  saw tearstrembling out of her beautiful eyelashes.\"\\n\"Do you weep for me?\"\\n hewhispered.\"\\n \"Oh weep not, thou loveliest of women.\"\\nNow do I begin tounderstand the happiness of  paradise; I feel it to my inmost soul,in every thought.\"\\nA new life is born within  me.\"\\nOne moment of suchhappiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe.\"\\n He stooped  andkissed the tears from her eyes, and touched her lips with his.\"\\n A clap of thunder, loud and awful, resounded through the tremblingair.\"\\nAll around  him fell into ruin.\"\\nThe lovely fairy, the beautifulgarden, sunk deeper and deeper.\"\\n The prince saw it sinking down inthe dark night till it shone only like a star in  the distancebeneath him.\"\\nThen he felt a coldness, like death, creeping over him;his  eyes closed, and he became insensible.\"\\n When he recovered, a chilling rain was beating upon him, and asharp wind blew on his  head.\"\\n\"Alas!\"\\nwhat have I done?\"\\n he sighed; \"Ihave sinned like Adam, and the garden  of paradise has sunk into theearth.\"\\n He opened his eyes, and saw the star in the  distance, but itwas the morning star in heaven which glittered in the darkness.\"\\n Presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of theforest, close to the cavern  of the Winds, and the mother of theWinds sat by his side.\"\\nShe looked angry, and raised  her arm in the airas she spoke.\"\\n\"The very first evening!\"\\n she said.\"\\n\"Well, I expectedit!\"\\n If you were my son, you should go into the sack.\"\\n  \"And there he will have to go at last,\" said a strong old man,with large black wings,  and a scythe in his hand, whose name wasDeath.\"\\n\"He shall be laid in his coffin, but  not yet.\"\\nI will allowhim to wander about the world for a while, to atone for his sin,  andto give him time to become better.\"\\nBut I shall return when he leastexpects me.\"\\n I shall lay him in a black coffin, place it on my head,and fly away with it beyond  the stars.\"\\nThere also blooms a garden ofparadise, and if he is good and pious he will  be admitted; but ifhis thoughts are bad, and his heart is full of sin, he will sinkwith  his coffin deeper than the garden of paradise has sunk.\"\\nOnce inevery thousand years  I shall go and fetch him, when he will eitherbe condemned to sink still deeper, or  be raised to a happier life inthe world beyond the stars.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE GIRL WHO TROD ON THE LOAF  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling hershoes, and the misfortunes  that happened to her in consequence arewell known.\"\\nHer name was Inge; she was a poor  child, but proud andpresuming, and with a bad and cruel disposition.\"\\nWhen quite a  littlechild she would delight in catching flies, and tearing off theirwings, so as  to make creeping things of them.\"\\nWhen older, she wouldtake cockchafers and beetles,  and stick pins through them.\"\\nThen shepushed a green leaf, or a little scrap of paper  towards their feet,and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it fast, andturn  over and over in their struggles to get free from the pin, shewould say, \"The  cockchafer is reading; see how he turns over theleaf.\"\\n She grew worse instead of better  with years, and,unfortunately, she was pretty, which caused her to be excused, whenshe  should have been sharply reproved.\"\\n \"Your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it,\" her motheroften said to her.\"\\n \"As a little child you used to trample on my apron,but one day I fear you will trample  on my heart.\"\\n And, alas!\"\\nthis fearwas realized.\"\\n Inge was taken to the house of some rich people, who lived at adistance, and who treated  her as their own child, and dressed her sofine that her pride and arrogance increased.\"\\n When she had been there about a year, her patroness said to her,\"You ought to go,  for once, and see your parents, Inge.\"\\n  So Inge started to go and visit her parents; but she only wantedto show herself in  her native place, that the people might see howfine she was.\"\\nShe reached the entrance  of the village, and saw theyoung laboring men and maidens standing together chatting,  and her ownmother amongst them.\"\\nInge\\'s mother was sitting on a stone to rest,with  a fagot of sticks lying before her, which she had picked up inthe wood.\"\\nThen Inge  turned back; she who was so finely dressed shefelt ashamed of her mother, a poorly  clad woman, who picked up wood inthe forest.\"\\nShe did not turn back out of pity for  her mother\\'spoverty, but from pride.\"\\n Another half-year went by, and her mistress said, \"you ought to gohome again, and  visit your parents, Inge, and I will give you alarge wheaten loaf to take to them,  they will be glad to see you, I amsure.\"\\n  So Inge put on her best clothes, and her new shoes, drew her dressup around her, and  set out, stepping very carefully, that she might beclean and neat about the feet,  and there was nothing wrong in doingso.\"\\nBut when she came to the place where the  footpath led across themoor, she found small pools of water, and a great deal of mud,  soshe threw the loaf into the mud, and trod upon it, that she might passwithout wetting  her feet.\"\\nBut as she stood with one foot on the loafand the other lifted up to step  forward, the loaf began to sinkunder her, lower and lower, till she disappeared  altogether, andonly a few bubbles on the surface of the muddy pool remained to  showwhere she had sunk.\"\\nAnd this is the story.\"\\n But where did Inge go?\"\\nShe sank into the ground, and went downto the Marsh Woman,  who is always brewing there.\"\\n The Marsh Woman is related to the elf maidens, who are well-known,for songs are sung  and pictures painted about them.\"\\nBut of the MarshWoman nothing is known, excepting  that when a mist arises from themeadows, in summer time, it is because she is brewing  beneath them.\"\\nTothe Marsh Woman\\'s brewery Inge sunk down to a place which no one  canendure for long.\"\\nA heap of mud is a palace compared with the MarshWoman\\'s brewery;  and as Inge fell she shuddered in every limb, andsoon became cold and stiff as marble.\"\\n Her foot was still fastened tothe loaf, which bowed her down as a golden ear of corn  bends the stem.\"\\n An evil spirit soon took possession of Inge, and carried her toa still worse place,  in which she saw crowds of unhappy people,waiting in a state of agony for the gates  of mercy to be opened tothem, and in every heart was a miserable and eternal feeling  ofunrest.\"\\nIt would take too much time to describe the various torturesthese people  suffered, but Inge\\'s punishment consisted in standingthere as a statue, with her foot  fastened to the loaf.\"\\nShe couldmove her eyes about, and see all the misery around  her, but shecould not turn her head; and when she saw the people looking at hershe  thought they were admiring her pretty face and fine clothes, forshe was still vain  and proud.\"\\nBut she had forgotten how soiled herclothes had become while in the Marsh  Woman\\'s brewery, and that theywere covered with mud; a snake had also fastened itself  in her hair,and hung down her back, while from each fold in her dress a great toadpeeped  out and croaked like an asthmatic poodle.\"\\nWorse than all wasthe terrible hunger that  tormented her, and she could not stoop tobreak off a piece of the loaf on which she  stood.\"\\nNo; her back was toostiff, and her whole body like a pillar of stone.\"\\nAnd then  camecreeping over her face and eyes flies without wings; she winked andblinked, but  they could not fly away, for their wings had beenpulled off; this, added to the hunger  she felt, was horrible torture.\"\\n \"If this lasts much longer,\" she said, \"I shall not be able tobear it.\"\\n But it did  last, and she had to bear it, without beingable to help herself.\"\\n A tear, followed by many scalding tears, fell upon her head, androlled over her face  and neck, down to the loaf on which she stood.Who could be weeping for Inge?\"\\nShe had  a mother in the world still,and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her child  will alwaysfind their way to the child\\'s heart, but they often increase thetorment  instead of being a relief.\"\\nAnd Inge could hear all that wassaid about her in the world  she had left, and every one seemed cruelto her.\"\\nThe sin she had committed in treading  on the loaf was known onearth, for she had been seen by the cowherd from the hill,  when shewas crossing the marsh and had disappeared.\"\\n When her mother wept and exclaimed, \"Ah, Inge!\"\\nwhat grief thouhast caused thy mother\"  she would say, \"Oh that I had never been born!My mother\\'s tears are useless now.\"\\n  And then the words of the kind people who had adopted her cameto her ears, when they  said, \"Inge was a sinful girl, who did notvalue the gifts of God, but trampled them  under her feet.\"\\n  \"Ah,\" thought Inge, \"they should have punished me, and drivenall my naughty tempers  out of me.\"\\n  A song was made about \"The girl who trod on a loaf to keep hershoes from being soiled,\"  and this song was sung everywhere.\"\\nThe storyof her sin was also told to the little  children, and they called her\"wicked Inge,\" and said she was so naughty that she ought  to bepunished.\"\\nInge heard all this, and her heart became hardened andfull of  bitterness.\"\\n But one day, while hunger and grief were gnawing in her hollowframe, she heard a little,  innocent child, while listening to the taleof the vain, haughty Inge, burst into tears  and exclaim, \"But will shenever come up again?\"\\n  And she heard the reply, \"No, she will never come up again.\"\\n  \"But if she were to say she was sorry, and ask pardon, and promisenever to do so again?\"\\n  asked the little one.\"\\n \"Yes, then she might come; but she will not beg pardon,\" was theanswer.\"\\n \"Oh, I wish she would!\"\\n said the child, who was quite unhappyabout it.\"\\n\"I should be  so glad.\"\\nI would give up my doll and all myplaythings, if she could only come here  again.\"\\nPoor Inge!\"\\nit is sodreadful for her.\"\\n  These pitying words penetrated to Inge\\'s inmost heart, andseemed to do her good.\"\\nIt  was the first time any one had said, \"PoorInge!\"\\n without saying something about her  faults.\"\\nA little innocentchild was weeping, and praying for mercy for her.\"\\nIt made  her feelquite strange, and she would gladly have wept herself, and it added toher  torment to find she could not do so.\"\\nAnd while she thus sufferedin a place where nothing  changed, years passed away on earth, andshe heard her name less frequently mentioned.\"\\n But one day a sighreached her ear, and the words, \"Inge!\"\\nInge!\"\\nwhat a grief thou  hastbeen to me!\"\\nI said it would be so.\"\\n It was the last sigh of herdying mother.\"\\n After this, Inge heard her kind mistress say, \"Ah, poor Inge!shall I ever see thee  again?\"\\nPerhaps I may, for we know not what mayhappen in the future.\"\\n But Inge knew  right well that her mistresswould never come to that dreadful place.\"\\n Time-passed- a long bitter time- then Inge heard her namepronounced once more, and  saw what seemed two bright stars shiningabove her.\"\\nThey were two gentle eyes closing  on earth.\"\\nMany yearshad passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about  \"poorInge.\"\\n That child was now an old woman, whom God was taking toHimself.\"\\nIn the  last hour of existence the events of a whole lifeoften appear before us; and this  hour the old woman remembered how,when a child, she had shed tears over the story  of Inge, and sheprayed for her now.\"\\nAs the eyes of the old woman closed to earth,the  eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity, andthen she, in whose  last thoughts Inge had been so vividly present, sawhow deeply the poor girl had sunk.\"\\n She burst into tears at thesight, and in heaven, as she had done when a little child  on earth,she wept and prayed for poor Inge.\"\\nHer tears and her prayers echoedthrough  the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul,and the unexpected mercy  was obtained for it through an angel\\'s tears.As in thought Inge seemed to act over  again every sin she hadcommitted on earth, she trembled, and tears she had never yet  beenable to weep rushed to her eyes.\"\\nIt seemed impossible that the gatesof mercy could  ever be opened to her; but while she acknowledgedthis in deep penitence, a beam of  radiant light shot suddenly into thedepths upon her.\"\\nMore powerful than the sunbeam  that dissolves the manof snow which the children have raised, more quickly than  thesnowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the warm lips of achild, was the  stony form of Inge changed, and as a little bird shesoared, with the speed of lightning,  upward to the world of mortals.\"\\nAbird that felt timid and shy to all things around  it, that seemed toshrink with shame from meeting any living creature, and  hurriedlysought to conceal itself in a dark corner of an old ruined wall; thereit  sat cowering and unable to utter a sound, for it was voiceless.\"\\nYethow quickly the  little bird discovered the beauty of everything aroundit.\"\\nThe sweet, fresh air; the  soft radiance of the moon, as itslight spread over the earth; the fragrance which  exhaled from bush andtree, made it feel happy as it sat there clothed in its  fresh,bright plumage.\"\\nAll creation seemed to speak of beneficence andlove.\"\\nThe bird  wanted to give utterance to thoughts that stirred inhis breast, as the cuckoo and  the nightingale in the spring, but itcould not.\"\\nYet in heaven can be heard the song  of praise, even froma worm; and the notes trembling in the breast of the bird were  asaudible to Heaven even as the psalms of David before they hadfashioned themselves  into words and song.\"\\n Christmas-time drew near, and a peasant who dwelt close by the oldwall stuck up a  pole with some ears of corn fastened to the top,that the birds of heaven might have  feast, and rejoice in the happy,blessed time.\"\\nAnd on Christmas morning the sun arose  and shone uponthe ears of corn, which were quickly surrounded by a number oftwittering  birds.\"\\nThen, from a hole in the wall, gushed forth insong the swelling thoughts of  the bird as he issued from his hidingplace to perform his first good deed on earth,-  and in heaven it waswell known who that bird was.\"\\n The winter was very hard; the ponds were covered with ice, andthere was very little  food for either the beasts of the field or thebirds of the air.\"\\nOur little bird flew  away into the public roads, andfound here and there, in the ruts of the sledges, a  grain of corn, andat the halting places some crumbs.\"\\nOf these he ate only a few, buthe  called around him the other birds and the hungry sparrows, thatthey too might have  food.\"\\nHe flew into the towns, and looked about,and wherever a kind hand had strewed  bread on the window-sill forthe birds, he only ate a single crumb himself, and gave  all the restto the rest of the other birds.\"\\nIn the course of the winter the birdhad  in this way collected many crumbs and given them to other birds,till they equalled  the weight of the loaf on which Inge had trod tokeep her shoes clean; and when the  last bread-crumb had been found andgiven, the gray wings of the bird became white,  and spreadthemselves out for flight.\"\\n \"See, yonder is a sea-gull!\"\\n cried the children, when they saw thewhite bird, as it  dived into the sea, and rose again into the clearsunlight, white and glittering.\"\\nBut  no one could tell whither itwent then although some declared it flew straight to the  sun.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  THE GOBLIN AND THE HUCKSTER  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret, and hadno possessions.\"\\nAnd  there was also a regular huckster, to whom thehouse belonged, and who occupied the  ground floor.\"\\nA goblin lived withthe huckster, because at Christmas he always had  a large dish fullof jam, with a great piece of butter in the middle.\"\\nThe huckster  couldafford this; and therefore the goblin remained with the huckster,which was very  cunning of him.\"\\n One evening the student came into the shop through the back doorto buy candles and  cheese for himself, he had no one to send, andtherefore he came himself; he obtained  what he wished, and then thehuckster and his wife nodded good evening to him, and  she was awoman who could do more than merely nod, for she had usually plenty tosay  for herself.\"\\nThe student nodded in return as he turned to leave,then suddenly stopped,  and began reading the piece of paper in whichthe cheese was wrapped.\"\\nIt was a leaf  torn out of an old book, abook that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full  of poetry.\"\\n \"Yonder lies some more of the same sort,\" said the huckster: \"Igave an old woman a  few coffee berries for it; you shall have the restfor sixpence, if you will.\"\\n  \"Indeed I will,\" said the student; \"give me the book instead ofthe cheese; I can eat  my bread and butter without cheese.\"\\nIt wouldbe a sin to tear up a book like this.\"\\n You are a clever man; and apractical man; but you understand no more about poetry  than thatcask yonder.\"\\n  This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask; butthe huckster and the  student both laughed, for it was only said infun.\"\\nBut the goblin felt very angry that  any man should venture to saysuch things to a huckster who was a householder and sold  the bestbutter.\"\\nAs soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and every one inbed  except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroomwhere the huckster\\'s  wife slept, and took away her tongue, which ofcourse, she did not then want.\"\\nWhatever  object in the room he placedhis tongue upon immediately received voice and speech,  and was able toexpress its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself coulddo.\"\\n It could only be used by one object at a time, which was a goodthing, as a number  speaking at once would have caused great confusion.The goblin laid the tongue upon  the cask, in which lay a quantity ofold newspapers.\"\\n \"Is it really true,\" he asked, that you do not know what poetryis?\"\\n  \"Of course I know,\" replied the cask: \"poetry is something thatalways stand in the  corner of a newspaper, and is sometimes cut out;and I may venture to affirm that I  have more of it in me than thestudent has, and I am only a poor tub of the huckster\\'s.\"\\n  Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill; and how itdid go to be sure!\"\\n Then he put it on the butter tub and the cashbox, and they all expressed the same  opinion as the waste-paper tub;and a majority must always be respected.\"\\n \"Now I shall go and tell the student,\" said the goblin; and withthese words he went  quietly up the back stairs to the garret where thestudent lived.\"\\nHe had a candle  burning still, and the goblin peepedthrough the keyhole and saw that he was reading  in the torn book,which he had brought out of the shop.\"\\nBut how light the room was!\"\\n Fromthe book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full, like thestem of  a tree, from which bright rays spread upward and over thestudent\\'s head.\"\\nEach leaf  was fresh, and each flower was like abeautiful female head; some with dark and  sparkling eyes, and otherswith eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear.\"\\nThe fruit  gleamed likestars, and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music.\"\\nThelittle  goblin had never imagined, much less seen or heard of, anysight so glorious as this.\"\\n He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in,till the light went out in the garret.\"\\nThe student  no doubt hadblown out his candle and gone to bed; but the little goblin  remainedstanding there nevertheless, and listening to the music which stillsounded  on, soft and beautiful, a sweet cradle-song for the student,who had lain down to rest.\"\\n  \"This is a wonderful place,\" said the goblin; \"I never expectedsuch a thing.\"\\nI should  like to stay here with the student;\" and thelittle man thought it over, for he was  a sensible little spirit.\"\\nAtlast he sighed, \"but the student has no jam!\"\\n So he went  down stairsagain into the huckster\\'s shop, and it was a good thing he got backwhen  he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady\\'s tongue; hehad given a description  of all that he contained on one side, andwas just about to turn himself over to the  other side to describe whatwas there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue  to thelady.\"\\nBut from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash boxdown to the  pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of thecask; and they all had such  confidence in him, and treated him with somuch respect, that when the huckster read  the criticisms ontheatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all comefrom  the cask.\"\\n But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit andlisten quietly to the  wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, assoon as the evening light glimmered in  the garret, he took courage,for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong  cables,drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole;and, while  there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as weexperience by the ever-moving  sea, when the storm breaks forth; and itbrought tears into his eyes.\"\\nHe did not himself  know why he wept,yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears.\"\\n \"Howwonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under sucha tree;\" but  that was out of the question, he must be content tolook through the keyhole, and be  thankful for even that.\"\\n There he stood on the old landing, with the autumn wind blowingdown upon him through  the trap-door.\"\\nIt was very cold; but thelittle creature did not really feel it, till  the light in the garretwent out, and the tones of music died away.\"\\nThen how he  shivered,and crept down stairs again to his warm corner, where it felthome-like and  comfortable.\"\\nAnd when Christmas came again, andbrought the dish of jam and the great  lump of butter, he liked thehuckster best of all.\"\\n Soon after, in the middle of the night, the goblin was awoke bya terrible noise and  knocking against the window shutters and thehouse doors, and by the sound of the  watchman\\'s horn; for a great firehad broken out, and the whole street appeared full  of flames.\"\\nWas itin their house, or a neighbor\\'s?\"\\nNo one could tell, for terror  hadseized upon all.\"\\nThe huckster\\'s wife was so bewildered that she tookher gold  ear-rings out of her ears and put them in her pocket, thatshe might save something  at least.\"\\nThe huckster ran to get hisbusiness papers, and the servant resolved to  save her blue silkmantle, which she had managed to buy.\"\\nEach wished to keep the  bestthings they had.\"\\nThe goblin had the same wish; for, with one spring,he was up  stairs and in the student\\'s room, whom he found standingby the open window, and looking  quite calmly at the fire, which wasraging at the house of a neighbor opposite.\"\\nThe  goblin caught up thewonderful book which lay on the table, and popped it into his  red cap,which he held tightly with both hands.\"\\nThe greatest treasure in thehouse was  saved; and he ran away with it to the roof, and seatedhimself on the chimney.\"\\nThe  flames of the burning house oppositeilluminated him as he sat, both hands pressed  tightly over his cap, inwhich the treasure lay; and then he found out what feelings  reallyreigned in his heart, and knew exactly which way they tended.\"\\nAnd yet,when the  fire was extinguished, and the goblin again began to reflect,he hesitated, and said  at last, \"I must divide myself between the two;I cannot quite give up the huckster,  because of the jam.\"\\n  And this is a representation of human nature.\"\\nWe are like thegoblin; we all go to  visit the huckster \"because of the jam.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE GOLDEN TREASURE  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE drummer\\'s wife went into the church.\"\\nShe saw the new altarwith the painted pictures  and the carved angels.\"\\nThose upon the canvasand in the glory over the altar were just  as beautiful as the carvedones; and they were painted and gilt into the bargain.\"\\nTheir  hairgleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to behold; but the realsunshine was more  beautiful still.\"\\nIt shone redder, clearer throughthe dark trees, when the sun went  down.\"\\nIt was lovely thus to lookat the sunshine of heaven.\"\\nAnd she looked at the red  sun, and shethought about it so deeply, and thought of the little one whom thestork  was to bring, and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful, andlooked and looked,  and wished that the child might have a gleam ofsunshine given to it, so that it might  at least become like one of theshining angels over the altar.\"\\n And when she really had the little child in her arms, and heldit up to its father,  then it was like one of the angels in thechurch to behold, with hair like gold- the  gleam of the setting sunwas upon it.\"\\n \"My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!\"\\n said the mother; andshe kissed the  shining locks, and it sounded like music and song inthe room of the drummer; and there  was joy, and life, and movement.The drummer beat a roll- a roll of joy.\"\\nAnd the Drum  said- theFire-drum, that was beaten when there was a fire in the town:  \"Red hair!\"\\nthe little fellow has red hair!\"\\nBelieve the drum, andnot what your mother  says!\"\\nRub-a dub, rub-a dub!\"\\n  And the town repeated what the Fire-drum had said.\"\\n The boy was taken to church, the boy was christened.\"\\nThere wasnothing much to be said  about his name; he was called Peter.\"\\nThe wholetown, and the Drum too, called him Peter  the drummer\\'s boy with thered hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and called  him hergolden treasure.\"\\n In the hollow way in the clayey bank, many had scratched theirnames as a remembrance.\"\\n \"Celebrity is always something!\"\\n said the drummer; and so hescratched his own name  there, and his little son\\'s name likewise.\"\\n And the swallows came.\"\\nThey had, on their long journey, seenmore durable characters  engraven on rocks, and on the walls of thetemples in Hindostan, mighty deeds of great  kings, immortal names,so old that no one now could read or speak them.\"\\nRemarkable  celebrity!\"\\n In the clayey bank the martens built their nest.\"\\nThey boredholes in the deep declivity,  and the splashing rain and the thinmist came and crumbled and washed the names away,  and the drummer\\'sname also, and that of his little son.\"\\n \"Peter\\'s name will last a full year and a half longer!\"\\n said thefather.\"\\n \"Fool!\"\\n thought the Fire-drum; but it only said, \"Dub, dub, dub,rub-a-dub!\"\\n  He was a boy full of life and gladness, this drummer\\'s son withthe red hair.\"\\nHe had  a lovely voice.\"\\nHe could sing, and he sang like abird in the woodland.\"\\nThere was melody,  and yet no melody.\"\\n \"He must become a chorister boy,\" said his mother.\"\\n\"He shallsing in the church, and  stand among the beautiful gilded angels whoare like him!\"\\n  \"Fiery cat!\"\\n said some of the witty ones of the town.\"\\n The Drum heard that from the neighbors\\' wives.\"\\n \"Don\\'t go home, Peter,\" cried the street boys.\"\\n\"If you sleep inthe garret, there\\'ll  be a fire in the house, and the fire-drum willhave to be beaten.\"\\n  \"Look out for the drumsticks,\" replied Peter; and, small as hewas, he ran up boldly,  and gave the foremost such a punch in thebody with his fist, that the fellow lost  his legs and tumbled over,and the others took their legs off with themselves very  rapidly.\"\\n The town musician was very genteel and fine.\"\\nHe was the son of theroyal plate-washer.\"\\n He was very fond of Peter, and would sometimestake him to his home; and he gave him  a violin, and taught him to playit.\"\\nIt seemed as if the whole art lay in the boy\\'s  fingers; and hewanted to be more than a drummer- he wanted to become musician tothe  town.\"\\n \"I\\'ll be a soldier,\" said Peter; for he was still quite a littlelad, and it seemed  to him the finest thing in the world to carry agun, and to be able to march one, two\\ufffeone, two, and to wear a uniformand a sword.\"\\n \"Ah, you learn to long for the drum-skin, drum, dum, dum!\"\\n saidthe Drum.\"\\n \"Yes, if he could only march his way up to be a general!\"\\n observedhis father; \"but  before he can do that, there must be war.\"\\n  \"Heaven forbid!\"\\n said his mother.\"\\n \"We have nothing to lose,\" remarked the father.\"\\n \"Yes, we have my boy,\" she retorted.\"\\n \"But suppose he came back a general!\"\\n said the father.\"\\n \"Without arms and legs!\"\\n cried the mother.\"\\n\"No, I would ratherkeep my golden treasure  with me.\"\\n  \"Drum, dum, dum!\"\\n The Fire-drum and all the other drums werebeating, for war had come.\"\\n The soldiers all set out, and the son ofthe drummer followed them.\"\\n\"Red-head.\"\\nGolden  treasure!\"\\n  The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him \"famous;\" the townmusician was of opinion  that he ought not to go to war, but shouldstay at home and learn music.\"\\n \"Red-head,\" said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed; butwhen one of them sometimes  said to another, \"Foxey,\" he would bite histeeth together and look another way- into  the wide world.\"\\nHe did notcare for the nickname.\"\\n The boy was active, pleasant of speech, and good-humored; thatis the best canteen,  said his old comrades.\"\\n And many a night he had to sleep under the open sky, wet throughwith the driving rain  or the falling mist; but his good humor neverforsook him.\"\\nThe drum-sticks sounded,  \"Rub-a-dub, all up, all up!\"\\nYes, he was certainly born to be a drummer.\"\\n The day of battle dawned.\"\\nThe sun had not yet risen, but themorning was come.\"\\nThe  air was cold, the battle was hot; there was mistin the air, but still more  gunpowder-smoke.\"\\nThe bullets and shellsflew over the soldiers\\' heads, and into their  heads- into their bodiesand limbs; but still they pressed forward.\"\\nHere or there one  orother of them would sink on his knees, with bleeding temples and aface as white  as chalk.\"\\nThe little drummer still kept his healthycolor; he had suffered no damage;  he looked cheerfully at the dog ofthe regiment, which was jumping along as merrily  as if the whole thinghad been got up for his amusement, and as if the bullets were  onlyflying about that he might have a game of play with them.\"\\n \"March!\"\\nForward!\"\\nMarch!\"\\n This, was the word of command for thedrum.\"\\nThe word had not  yet been given to fall back, though theymight have done so, and perhaps there would  have been much sense init; and now at last the word \"Retire\" was given; but our  littledrummer beat \"Forward!\"\\nmarch!\"\\n for he had understood the command thus,and the  soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum.\"\\nThat was a good roll,and proved the summons  to victory for the men, who had already begunto give way.\"\\n Life and limb were lost in the battle.\"\\nBombshells tore away theflesh in red strips;  bombshells lit up into a terrible glow thestrawheaps to which the wounded had dragged  themselves, to lieuntended for many hours, perhaps for all the hours they had to live.\"\\n It\\'s no use thinking of it; and yet one cannot help thinking ofit, even far away in  the peaceful town.\"\\nThe drummer and his wifealso thought of it, for Peter was at the  war.\"\\n \"Now, I\\'m tired of these complaints,\" said the Fire-drum.\"\\n Again the day of battle dawned; the sun had not yet risen, butit was morning.\"\\nThe  drummer and his wife were asleep.\"\\nThey had beentalking about their son, as, indeed,  they did almost every night,for he was out yonder in God\\'s hand.\"\\nAnd the father dreamt  that thewar was over, that the soldiers had returned home, and that Peter worea silver  cross on his breast.\"\\nBut the mother dreamt that she hadgone into the church, and had  seen the painted pictures and the carvedangels with the gilded hair, and her own dear  boy, the golden treasureof her heart, who was standing among the angels in white  robes,singing so sweetly, as surely only the angels can sing; and that hehad soared  up with them into the sunshine, and nodded so kindly at hismother.\"\\n \"My golden treasure!\"\\n she cried out; and she awoke.\"\\n\"Now thegood God has taken him  to Himself!\"\\n She folded her hands, and hidher face in the cotton curtains of the bed,  and wept.\"\\n\"Where does herest now?\"\\namong the many in the big grave that they have dug  for thedead?\"\\nPerhaps he\\'s in the water in the marsh!\"\\nNobody knows hisgrave; no holy  words have been read over it!\"\\n And the Lord\\'s Prayerwent inaudibly over her lips;  she bowed her head, and was so wearythat she went to sleep.\"\\n And the days went by, in life as in dreams!\"\\n It was evening.\"\\nOver the battle-field a rainbow spread, whichtouched the forest and  the deep marsh.\"\\n It has been said, and is preserved in popular belief, that wherethe rainbow touches  the earth a treasure lies buried, a goldentreasure; and here there was one.\"\\nNo one  but his mother thought of thelittle drummer, and therefore she dreamt of him.\"\\n And the days went by, in life as in dreams!\"\\n Not a hair of his head had been hurt, not a golden hair.\"\\n \"Drum-ma-rum!\"\\ndrum-ma-rum!\"\\nthere he is!\"\\n the Drum might have said,and his mother might  have sung, if she had seen or dreamt it.\"\\n With hurrah and song, adorned with green wreaths of victory,they came home, as the  war was at an end, and peace had been signed.The dog of the regiment sprang on in  front with large bounds, and madethe way three times as long for himself as it really  was.\"\\n And days and weeks went by, and Peter came into his parents\\' room.He was as brown  as a wild man, and his eyes were bright, and hisface beamed like sunshine.\"\\nAnd his  mother held him in her arms; shekissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair.\"\\nShe  had her boyback again; he had not a silver cross on his breast, as his father haddreamt,  but he had sound limbs, a thing the mother had not dreamt.\"\\nAndwhat a rejoicing was  there!\"\\nThey laughed and they wept; and Peterembraced the old Fire-drum.\"\\n \"There stands the old skeleton still!\"\\n he said.\"\\n And the father beat a roll upon it.\"\\n \"One would think that a great fire had broken out here,\" saidthe Fire-drum.\"\\n\"Bright  day!\"\\nfire in the heart!\"\\ngolden treasure!\"\\nskrat!skr-r-at!\"\\nskr-r-r-r-at!\"\\n  And what then?\"\\nWhat then!- Ask the town musician.\"\\n \"Peter\\'s far outgrowing the drum,\" he said.\"\\n\"Peter will be greaterthan I.\"\\n  And yet he was the son of a royal plate-washer; but all that hehad learned in half  a lifetime, Peter learned in half a year.\"\\n There was something so merry about him, something so trulykind-hearted.\"\\nHis eyes  gleamed, and his hair gleamed too- there was nodenying that!\"\\n \"He ought to have his hair dyed,\" said the neighbor\\'s wife.\"\\nThat answered capitally  with the policeman\\'s daughter, and she gota husband.\"\\n  \"But her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always havingto be colored up.\"\\n  \"She knows how to manage for herself,\" said the neighbors, \"and socan Peter.\"\\nHe comes  to the most genteel houses, even to theburgomaster\\'s where he gives Miss Charlotte  piano-forte lessons.\"\\n  He could play!\"\\nHe could play, fresh out of his heart, the mostcharming pieces, that  had never been put upon music-paper.\"\\nHe playedin the bright nights, and in the dark  nights, too.\"\\nThe neighborsdeclared it was unbearable, and the Fire-drum was of the  same opinion.\"\\n He played until his thoughts soared up, and burst forth in greatplans for the future:  \"To be famous!\"\\n  And burgomaster\\'s Charlotte sat at the piano.\"\\nHer delicate fingersdanced over the  keys, and made them ring into Peter\\'s heart.\"\\nIt seemedtoo much for him to bear; and  this happened not once, but manytimes; and at last one day he seized the delicate  fingers and thewhite hand, and kissed it, and looked into her great brown eyes.Heaven  knows what he said; but we may be allowed to guess at it.Charlotte blushed to guess  at it.\"\\nShe reddened from brow to neck,and answered not a single word; and then  strangers came into the room,and one of them was the state councillor\\'s son.\"\\nHe had  a lofty whiteforehead, and carried it so high that it seemed to go back into hisneck.\"\\n And Peter sat by her a long time, and she looked at him withgentle eyes.\"\\n At home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world, andof the golden treasure  that lay hidden for him in his violin.\"\\n \"To be famous!\"\\n  \"Tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum!\"\\n said the Fire-drum.\"\\n\"Peterhas gone clear out  of his wits.\"\\nI think there must be a fire in thehouse.\"\\n  Next day the mother went to market.\"\\n \"Shall I tell you news, Peter?\"\\n she asked when she came home.\"\\n\"Acapital piece of news.\"\\n Burgomaster\\'s Charlotte has engaged herselfto the state councillor\\'s son; the  betrothal took place yesterdayevening.\"\\n  \"No!\"\\n cried Peter, and he sprang up from his chair.\"\\nBut his motherpersisted in saying  \"Yes.\"\\n She had heard it from the baker\\'s wife,whose husband had it from the  burgomaster\\'s own mouth  And Peter became as pale as death, and sat down again.\"\\n \"Good Heaven!\"\\nwhat\\'s the matter with you?\"\\n asked his mother.\"\\n \"Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself,\" he answered but thetears were running  down his cheeks.\"\\n \"My sweet child, my golden treasure!\"\\n cried the mother, and shewept; but the Fire-drum  sang, not out loud, but inwardly.\"\\n \"Charlotte\\'s gone!\"\\nCharlotte\\'s gone!\"\\nand now the song is done.\"\\n  But the song was not done; there were many more verses in it, longverses, the most  beautiful verses, the golden treasures of a life.\"\\n \"She behaves like a mad woman,\" said the neighbor\\'s wife.\"\\n\"All theworld is to see  the letters she gets from her golden treasure, andto read the words that are written  in the papers about his violinplaying.\"\\nAnd he sends her money too, and that\\'s very  useful to hersince she has been a widow.\"\\n  \"He plays before emperors and kings,\" said the town musician.\"\\n\"Inever had that fortune,  but he\\'s my pupil, and he does not forgethis old master.\"\\n  And his mother said,  \"His father dreamt that Peter came home from the war with a silvercross.\"\\nHe did not  gain one in the war, but it is still moredifficult to gain one in this way.\"\\nNow he  has the cross of honor.\"\\nIfhis father had only lived to see it!\"\\n  \"He\\'s grown famous!\"\\n said the Fire-drum, and all his native townsaid the same thing,  for the drummer\\'s son, Peter with the red hair-Peter whom they had known as a little  boy, running about in woodenshoes, and then as a drummer, playing for the dancers\\ufffewas becomefamous!\"\\n \"He played at our house before he played in the presence ofkings,\" said the  burgomaster\\'s wife.\"\\n\"At that time he was quitesmitten with Charlotte.\"\\nHe was always  of an aspiring turn.\"\\nAt thattime he was saucy and an enthusiast.\"\\nMy husband laughed  when heheard of the foolish affair, and now our Charlotte is a statecouncillor\\'s  wife.\"\\n  A golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of thepoor child, who had  beaten the roll as a drummer- a roll of victoryfor those who had been ready to retreat.\"\\n There was a golden treasurein his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his  violin as ifthe instrument had been a complete organ, and as if all the elves of  amidsummer night were dancing across the strings.\"\\nIn its sounds wereheard the piping  of the thrush and the full clear note of the humanvoice; therefore the sound brought  rapture to every heart, and carriedhis name triumphant through the land.\"\\nThat was  a great firebrand-the firebrand of inspiration.\"\\n \"And then he looks so splendid!\"\\n said the young ladies and the oldladies too; and  the oldest of all procured an album for famous locksof hair, wholly and solely that  she might beg a lock of his richsplendid hair, that treasure, that golden treasure.\"\\n And the son came into the poor room of the drummer, elegant as aprince, happier than  a king.\"\\nHis eyes were as clear and his face wasas radiant as sunshine; and he held  his mother in his arms, and shekissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one  can weep forjoy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at  thecupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.\"\\nHe nodded at thesleeping-bench,  where he had slept as a little boy; but the oldFire-drum he brought out, and dragged  it into the middle of theroom, and said to it and to his mother:  \"My father would have beaten a famous roll this evening.\"\\nNow Imust do it!\"\\n  And he beat a thundering roll-call on the instrument, and the Drumfelt so highly  honored that the parchment burst with exultation.\"\\n \"He has a splendid touch!\"\\n said the Drum.\"\\n\"I\\'ve a remembrance ofhim now that will  last.\"\\nI expect that the same thing will happen tohis mother, from pure joy over her  golden treasure.\"\\n  And this is the story of the Golden Treasure.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE GOLOSHES OF FORTUNE  by Hans Christian Andersen  A BEGINNING  IN a house in Copenhagen, not far from the king\\'s new market, avery large party had  assembled, the host and his family expecting,no doubt, to receive invitations in  return.\"\\nOne half of the companywere already seated at the card-tables, the other half  seemed to bewaiting the result of their hostess\\'s question, \"Well, how shall weamuse  ourselves?\"\\n  Conversation followed, which, after a while, began to prove veryentertaining.\"\\nAmong  other subjects, it turned upon the events of themiddle ages, which some persons  maintained were more full ofinterest than our own times.\"\\nCounsellor Knapp defended  this opinion sowarmly that the lady of the house immediately went over to his side,and  both exclaimed against Oersted\\'s Essays on Ancient and ModernTimes, in which the  preference is given to our own.\"\\nThe counsellorconsidered the times of the Danish king,  Hans, as the noblest andhappiest.\"\\n The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a momentby the arrival of  a newspaper, which did not, however, contain muchworth reading, and while it is still  going on we will pay a visit tothe ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes  were carefullyplaced.\"\\nHere sat two maidens, one young, and the other old, as if theyhad  come and were waiting to accompany their mistresses home; but onlooking at them more  closely, it could easily be seen that they wereno common servants.\"\\nTheir shapes were  too graceful, theircomplexions too delicate, and the cut of their dresses much  tooelegant.\"\\nThey were two fairies.\"\\nThe younger was not Fortune herself,but the  chambermaid of one of Fortune\\'s attendants, who carriesabout her more trifling gifts.\"\\n The elder one, who was named Care,looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to  perform her ownbusiness in person; for then she knows it is properly done.\"\\nTheywere  telling each other where they had been during the day.\"\\nThemessenger of Fortune had  only transacted a few unimportant matters;for instance, she had preserved a new bonnet  from a shower of rain,and obtained for an honest man a bow from a titled nobody, and  soon; but she had something extraordinary to relate, after all.\"\\n \"I must tell you,\" said she, \"that to-day is my birthday; and inhonor of it I have  been intrusted with a pair of goloshes, tointroduce amongst mankind.\"\\nThese goloshes  have the property ofmaking every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place  hewishes, or that he exists at any period.\"\\nEvery wish is fulfilled atthe moment it  is expressed, so that for once mankind have the chanceof being happy.\"\\n  No,\" replied Care; \"you may depend upon it that whoever puts onthose goloshes will  be very unhappy, and bless the moment in whichhe can get rid of them.\"\\n  \"What are you thinking of?\"\\n replied the other.\"\\n\"Now see; I willplace them by the door;  some one will take them instead of his own,and he will be the happy man.\"\\n  This was the end of their conversation.COUNSELLOR  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNSELLOR  IT was late when Counsellor Knapp, lost in thought about the timesof King Hans, desired  to return home; and fate so ordered it that heput on the goloshes of Fortune instead  of his own, and walked out intothe East Street.\"\\nThrough the magic power of the goloshes,  he was atonce carried back three hundred years, to the times of King Hans,for which  he had been longing when he put them on.\"\\nTherefore heimmediately set his foot into  the mud and mire of the street, which inthose days possessed no pavement.\"\\n \"Why, this is horrible; how dreadfully dirty it is!\"\\n said thecounsellor; and the whole  pavement has vanished, and the lamps are allout.\"\\n  The moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the thickfoggy air, and all the  objects around him were confused together inthe darkness.\"\\nAt the nearest corner, a  lamp hung before a picture ofthe Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless,  for he onlyperceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the  paintedfigures of the Mother and Child.\"\\n \"That is most likely a museum of art,\" thought he, \"and theyhave forgotten to take  down the sign.\"\\n  Two men, in the dress of olden times, passed by him.\"\\n \"What odd figures!\"\\n thought he; \"they must be returning fromsome masquerade.\"\\n  Suddenly he heard the sound of a drum and fifes, and then ablazing light from torches  shone upon him.\"\\nThe counsellor staredwith astonishment as he beheld a most strange  procession pass beforehim.\"\\nFirst came a whole troop of drummers, beating their drums  verycleverly; they were followed by life-guards, with longbows andcrossbows.\"\\nThe  principal person in the procession was aclerical-looking gentleman.\"\\nThe astonished  counsellor asked what itall meant, and who the gentleman might be.\"\\n \"That is the bishop of Zealand.\"\\n  \"Good gracious!\"\\n he exclaimed; \"what in the world has happenedto the bishop?\"\\nwhat  can he be thinking about?\"\\n Then he shook hishead and said, \"It cannot possibly be  the bishop himself.\"\\n  While musing on this strange affair, and without looking to theright or left, he walked  on through East Street and over HighbridgePlace.\"\\nThe bridge, which he supposed led  to Palace Square, was nowhereto be found; but instead, he saw a bank and some shallow  water, andtwo people, who sat in a boat.\"\\n \"Does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the Holm?\"\\n asked one.\"\\n \"To the Holm!\"\\n exclaimed the counsellor, not knowing in what agehe was now existing;  \"I want to go to Christian\\'s Haven, in LittleTurf Street.\"\\n The men stared at him.\"\\n \"Pray tell me where the bridgeis!\"\\n said he.\"\\n\"It is shameful that the lamps are not  lighted here, andit is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh.\"\\n But the more  hetalked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other.\"\\n \"I don\\'t understand your outlandish talk,\" he cried at last,angrily turning his back  upon them.\"\\nHe could not, however, find thebridge nor any railings.\"\\n \"What a scandalous condition this place is in,\" said he; never,certainly, had he found  his own times so miserable as on this evening.\"\\nI think it will be better for me to  take a coach; but where arethey?\"\\n There was not one to be seen!\"\\n\"I shall be obliged  to go back tothe king\\'s new market,\" said he, \"where there are plenty ofcarriages  standing, or I shall never reach Christian\\'s Haven.\"\\n Then hewent towards East Street,  and had nearly passed through it, when themoon burst forth from a cloud.\"\\n \"Dear me, what have they been erecting here?\"\\n he cried, as hecaught sight of the East  gate, which in olden times used to stand atthe end of East Street.\"\\nHowever, he found  an opening through whichhe passed, and came out upon where he expected to find the  new market.Nothing was to be seen but an open meadow, surrounded by a few  bushes,through which ran a broad canal or stream.\"\\nA few miserable-lookingwooden  booths, for the accommodation of Dutch watermen, stood on theopposite shore.\"\\n \"Either I behold a fata morgana, or I must be tipsy,\" groanedthe counsellor.\"\\n\"What  can it be?\"\\nWhat is the matter with me?\"\\n Heturned back in the full conviction that  he must be ill.\"\\nIn walkingthrough the street this time, he examined the houses more  closely;he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster, and manyhad only  a thatched roof.\"\\n \"I am certainly all wrong,\" said he, with a sigh; and yet I onlydrank one glass of  punch.\"\\nBut I cannot bear even that, and it was veryfoolish to give us punch and hot  salmon; I shall speak about it to ourhostess, the agent\\'s lady.\"\\nSuppose I were to  go back now and say howill I feel, I fear it would look so ridiculous, and it is not  verylikely that I should find any one up.\"\\n Then he looked for the house,but it was  not in existence.\"\\n \"This is really frightful; I cannot even recognize East Street.Not a shop to be seen;  nothing but old, wretched, tumble-downhouses, just as if I were at Roeskilde or  Ringstedt.\"\\nOh, I really mustbe ill!\"\\nIt is no use to stand upon ceremony.\"\\nBut where  in the world isthe agent\\'s house.\"\\nThere is a house, but it is not his; and peoplestill  up in it, I can hear.\"\\nOh dear!\"\\nI certainly am very queer.\"\\n As hereached the half-open  door, he saw a light and went in.\"\\nIt was atavern of the olden times, and seemed a  kind of beershop.\"\\nThe room hadthe appearance of a Dutch interior.\"\\nA number of people,  consistingof seamen, Copenhagen citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deepconversation  over their mugs, and took very little notice of the newcomer.\"\\n \"Pardon me,\" said the counsellor, addressing the landlady, \"I donot feel quite well,  and I should be much obliged if you will send fora fly to take me to Christian\\'s Haven.\"\\n  The woman stared at him andshook her head.\"\\nThen she spoke to him in German.\"\\nThe  counsellorsupposed from this that she did not understand Danish; he thereforerepeated  his request in German.\"\\nThis, as well as his singular dress,convinced the woman that  he was a foreigner.\"\\nShe soon understood,however, that he did not find himself quite  well, and thereforebrought him a mug of water.\"\\nIt had something of the taste of  seawater,certainly, although it had been drawn from the well outside.\"\\nThenthe  counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, andpondered over all the  strange things that had happened to him.\"\\n \"Is that to-day\\'s number of the Day?\"\\n he asked, quitemechanically, as he saw the woman  putting by a large piece of paper.She did not understand what he meant, but she handed  him the sheet; itwas a woodcut, representing a meteor, which had appeared in the townof  Cologne.\"\\n \"That is very old,\" said the counsellor, becoming quite cheerfulat the sight of this  antique drawing.\"\\n\"Where did you get this singularsheet?\"\\nIt is very interesting,  although the whole affair is a fable.Meteors are easily explained in these days; they  are northernlights, which are often seen, and are no doubt caused by electricity.\"\\n  Those who sat near him, and heard what he said, looked at him ingreat astonishment,  and one of them rose, took off his hatrespectfully, and said in a very serious manner,  \"You must certainlybe a very learned man, monsieur.\"\\n  \"Oh no,\" replied the counsellor; \"I can only discourse on topicswhich every one should  understand.\"\\n  \"Modestia is a beautiful virtue,\" said the man.\"\\n\"Moreover, Imust add to your speech  mihi secus videtur; yet in this case I wouldsuspend my judicium.\"\\n  \"May I ask to whom I have the pleasure of speaking?\"\\n  \"I am a Bachelor of Divinity,\" said the man.\"\\nThis answer satisfiedthe counsellor.\"\\n The title agreed with the dress.\"\\n \"This is surely,\" thought he, \"an old village schoolmaster, aperfect original, such  as one meets with sometimes even in Jutland.\"\\n  \"This is not certainly a locus docendi,\" began the man; \"still Imust beg you to  continue the conversation.\"\\nYou must be well read inancient lore.\"\\n  \"Oh yes,\" replied the counsellor; \"I am very fond of readinguseful old books, and  modern ones as well, with the exception ofevery-day stories, of which we really have  more than enough.\"\\n \"Every-day stories?\"\\n asked the bachelor.\"\\n \"Yes, I mean the new novels that we have at the present day.\"\\n  \"Oh,\" replied the man, with a smile; \"and yet they are very witty,and are much read  at Court.\"\\nThe king likes especially the romance ofMesseurs Iffven and Gaudian, which  describes King Arthur and hisknights of the round table.\"\\nHe has joked about it with  the gentlemenof his Court.\"\\n  \"Well, I have certainly not read that,\" replied the counsellor.\"\\n\"Isuppose it is quite  new, and published by Heiberg.\"\\n  \"No,\" answered the man, \"it is not by Heiberg; Godfred vonGehman brought it out.\"\\n  \"Oh, is he the publisher?\"\\nThat is a very old name,\" said thecounsellor; \"was it not  the name of the first publisher in Denmark?\"\\n  \"Yes; and he is our first printer and publisher now,\" repliedthe scholar.\"\\n So far all had passed off very well; but now one of the citizensbegan to speak of  a terrible pestilence which had been raging a fewyears before, meaning the plague  of 1484.\"\\nThe counsellor thought hereferred to the cholera, and they could discuss  this without findingout the mistake.\"\\nThe war in 1490 was spoken of as quite recent.\"\\n TheEnglish pirates had taken some ships in the Channel in 1801, and thecounsellor,  supposing they referred to these, agreed with them infinding fault with the English.\"\\n The rest of the talk, however, was notso agreeable; every moment one contradicted  the other.\"\\nThe goodbachelor appeared very ignorant, for the simplest remark of  thecounsellor seemed to him either too bold or too fantastic.\"\\nThey staredat each other,  and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin,in the hope of being better  understood; but it was all useless.\"\\n \"How are you now?\"\\n asked the landlady, pulling the counsellor\\'ssleeve.\"\\n Then his recollection returned to him.\"\\nIn the course ofconversation he had forgotten  all that had happened previously.\"\\n \"Goodness me!\"\\nwhere am I?\"\\n said he.\"\\nIt bewildered him as hethought of it.\"\\n \"We will have some claret, or mead, or Bremen beer,\" said one ofthe guests; \"will  you drink with us?\"\\n  Two maids came in.\"\\nOne of them had a cap on her head of twocolors.\"\\nThey poured out  the wine, bowed their heads, and withdrew.\"\\n The counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him.\"\\n\"What is this?what does it mean?\"\\n  said he; but he was obliged to drink with them,for they overpowered the good man with  their politeness.\"\\nHe becameat last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy,  he didnot doubt the man\\'s word in the least- only begged them to get adroschky; and  then they thought he was speaking the Muscovitelanguage.\"\\nNever before had he been  in such rough and vulgar company.\"\\nOne might believe that the country was going back  to heathenism,\"he observed.\"\\n\"This is the most terrible moment of my life.\"\\n  Just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under thetable, and so creep to  the door.\"\\nHe tried it; but before he reachedthe entry, the rest discovered what he  was about, and seized him bythe feet, when, luckily for him, off came the goloshes,  and withthem vanished the whole enchantment.\"\\nThe counsellor now saw quiteplainly a  lamp, and a large building behind it; everything lookedfamiliar and beautiful.\"\\nHe  was in East Street, as it now appears; helay with his legs turned towards a porch,  and just by him sat thewatchman asleep.\"\\n \"Is it possible that I have been lying here in the streetdreaming?\"\\n said he.\"\\n\"Yes,  this is East Street; how beautifullybright and gay it looks!\"\\nIt is quite shocking  that one glass ofpunch should have upset me like this.\"\\n  Two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky, which was to drivehim to Christian\\'s  Haven.\"\\nHe thought of all the terror and anxietywhich he had undergone, and felt  thankful from his heart for thereality and comfort of modern times, which, with all  their errors,were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.\"\\n THE WATCHMAN\\'S ADVENTURES  \"Well, I declare, there lies a pair of goloshes,\" said thewatchman.\"\\n\"No doubt, they  belong to the lieutenant who lives upstairs.\"\\nThey are lying just by his door.\"\\n Gladly  would the honestman have rung, and given them in, for a light was still burning, buthe  did not wish to disturb the other people in the house; so he letthem lie.\"\\n\"These things  must keep the feet very warm,\" said he;\"they are of such nice soft leather.\"\\n Then  he tried them on, andthey fitted his feet exactly.\"\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"how droll things  are inthis world!\"\\nThere\\'s that man can lie down in his warm bed, but he doesnot do  so.\"\\nThere he goes pacing up and down the room.\"\\nHe ought to be ahappy man.\"\\nHe has neither  wife nor children, and he goes out intocompany every evening.\"\\nOh, I wish I were he;  then I should be ahappy man.\"\\n  As he uttered this wish, the goloshes which he had put on tookeffect, and the watchman  at once became the lieutenant.\"\\nThere he stoodin his room, holding a little piece of  pink paper between his fingers,on which was a poem,- a poem written by the lieutenant  himself.\"\\nWhohas not had, for once in his life, a moment of poetic inspiration?\"\\nandat  such a moment, if the thoughts are written down, they flow inpoetry.\"\\nThe following  verses were written on the pink paper:-  \"OH WERE I RICH!\"\\n \"Oh were I rich!\"\\nHow oft, in youth\\'s bright hour,  When youthful pleasures banish every care,  I longed for riches but to gain a power,  The sword and plume and uniform to wear!\"\\n The riches and the honor came for me;  Yet still my greatest wealth was poverty:  Ah, help and pity me!\"\\n \"Once in my youthful hours, when gay and free,  A maiden loved me; and her gentle kiss,  Rich in its tender love and purity,  Taught me, alas!\"\\ntoo much of earthly bliss.\"\\n Dear child!\"\\nShe only thought of youthful glee;  She loved no wealth, but fairy tales and me.\"\\n Thou knowest: ah, pity me!\"\\n \"Oh were I rich!\"\\nagain is all my prayer:  That child is now a woman, fair and free,  As good and beautiful as angels are.\"\\n Oh, were I rich in lovers\\' poetry,  To tell my fairy tale, love\\'s richest lore!\"\\n But no; I must be silent- I am poor.\"\\n Ah, wilt thou pity me?\"\\n \"Oh were I rich in truth and peace below,  I need not then my poverty bewail.\"\\n To thee I dedicate these lines of woe;  Wilt thou not understand the mournful tale?\"\\n A leaf on which my sorrows I relate\\ufffeDark story of a darker night of fate.\"\\n Ah, bless and pity me!\"\\n  \"Well, yes; people write poems when they are in love, but a wiseman will not print  them.\"\\nA lieutenant in love, and poor.\"\\nThis is atriangle, or more properly speaking,  the half of the broken die offortune.\"\\n The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and  therefore leanedhis head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.\"\\n\"The  poorwatchman in the street,\" said he, \"is far happier than I am.\"\\nHeknows not what  I call poverty.\"\\nHe has a home, a wife and children, whoweep at his sorrow and rejoice  at his joy.\"\\nOh, how much happier Ishould be could I change my being and position with  him, and passthrough life with his humble expectations and hopes!\"\\nYes, he is  indeedhappier than I am.\"\\n  At this moment the watchman again became a watchman; for having,through the goloshes  of Fortune, passed into the existence of thelieutenant, and found himself less  contented than he expected, hehad preferred his former condition, and wished himself  again awatchman.\"\\n\"That was an ugly dream,\" said he, \"but droll enough.\"\\nItseemed to  me as if I were the lieutenant up yonder, but there was nohappiness for me.\"\\nI missed  my wife and the little ones, who are alwaysready to smother me with kisses.\"\\n He sat  down again and nodded, but hecould not get the dream out of his thoughts, and he still  had thegoloshes on his feet.\"\\nA falling star gleamed across the sky.\"\\n\"Theregoes one!\"\\n  cried he.\"\\n\"However, there are quite enough left; I shouldvery much like to examine  these a little nearer, especially themoon, for that could not slip away under one\\'s  hands.\"\\nThe student, forwhom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from  onestar to another.\"\\nIf that were true, it would be very delightful, but Idon\\'t believe  it.\"\\nI wish I could make a little spring up there now;I would willingly let my body  lie here on the steps.\"\\n  There are certain things in the world which should be uttered verycautiously; doubly  so when the speaker has on his feet the goloshes ofFortune.\"\\nNow we shall hear what  happened to the watchman.\"\\n Nearly every one is acquainted with the great power of steam; wehave proved it by  the rapidity with which we can travel, both on arailroad or in a steamship across  the sea.\"\\nBut this speed is likethe movements of the sloth, or the crawling march of  the snail, whencompared to the swiftness with which light travels; light  fliesnineteen million times faster than the fleetest race-horse, andelectricity is  more rapid still.\"\\nDeath is an electric shock which wereceive in our hearts, and on  the wings of electricity the liberatedsoul flies away swiftly, the light from the  sun travels to our earthninety-five millions of miles in eight minutes and a few  seconds;but on the wings of electricity, the mind requires only a second toaccomplish  the same distance.\"\\nThe space between the heavenly bodiesis, to thought, no farther  than the distance which we may have to walkfrom one friend\\'s house to another in the  same town; yet this electricshock obliges us to use our bodies here below, unless,  like thewatchman, we have on the goloshes of Fortune.\"\\n In a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than twohundred thousand miles  to the moon, which is formed of a lightermaterial than our earth, and may be said  to be as soft as new fallensnow.\"\\nHe found himself on one of the circular range of  mountains whichwe see represented in Dr.\"\\nMadler\\'s large map of the moon.\"\\nThe  interiorhad the appearance of a large hollow, bowl-shaped, with a depthabout half  a mile from the brim.\"\\nWithin this hollow stood a largetown; we may form some idea  of its appearance by pouring the whiteof an egg into a glass of water.\"\\nThe materials  of which it was builtseemed just as soft, and pictured forth cloudy turrets and  sail-liketerraces, quite transparent, and floating in the thin air.\"\\nOur earthhung  over his head like a great dark red ball.\"\\nPresently he discovereda number of beings,  which might certainly be called men, but were verydifferent to ourselves.\"\\nA more  fantastical imagination than Herschel\\'smust have discovered these.\"\\nHad they been  placed in groups, andpainted, it might have been said, \"What beautiful foliage!\"\\n They  hadalso a language of their own.\"\\nNo one could have expected the soul ofthe watchman  to understand it, and yet he did understand it, for oursouls have much greater  capabilities then we are inclined tobelieve.\"\\nDo we not, in our dreams, show a wonderful  dramatic talent?each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his own character,and  with his own voice; no man could thus imitate them in his wakinghours.\"\\nHow clearly,  too, we are reminded of persons whom we have notseen for many years; they start up  suddenly to the mind\\'s eye with alltheir peculiarities as living realities.\"\\nIn fact,  this memory of thesoul is a fearful thing; every sin, every sinful thought it canbring  back, and we may well ask how we are to give account of \"everyidle word\" that may  have been whispered in the heart or uttered withthe lips.\"\\nThe spirit of the watchman  therefore understood very wellthe language of the inhabitants of the moon.\"\\nThey were  disputing aboutour earth, and doubted whether it could be inhabited.\"\\nTheatmosphere,  they asserted, must be too dense for any inhabitants ofthe moon to exist there.\"\\nThey  maintained that the moon alone wasinhabited, and was really the heavenly body in which  the old worldpeople lived.\"\\nThey likewise talked politics.\"\\n But now we will descend to East Street, and see what happened tothe watchman\\'s body.\"\\n He sat lifeless on the steps.\"\\nHis staff hadfallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared  at the moon, about whichhis honest soul was wandering.\"\\n \"What is it o\\'clock, watchman?\"\\n inquired a passenger.\"\\nBut therewas no answer from  the watchman.\"\\n The man then pulled his nose gently, which caused him to losehis balance.\"\\nThe body  fell forward, and lay at full length on theground as one dead.\"\\n All his comrades were very much frightened, for he seemed quitedead; still they  allowed him to remain after they had given noticeof what had happened; and at dawn  the body was carried to thehospital.\"\\nWe might imagine it to be no jesting matter if  the soul ofthe man should chance to return to him, for most probably it wouldseek  for the body in East Street without being able to find it.\"\\nWemight fancy the soul  inquiring of the police, or at the addressoffice, or among the missing parcels, and  then at length finding it atthe hospital.\"\\nBut we may comfort ourselves by the certainty  that thesoul, when acting upon its own impulses, is wiser than we are; it isthe body  that makes it stupid.\"\\n As we have said, the watchman\\'s body had been taken to thehospital, and here it was  placed in a room to be washed.\"\\nNaturally,the first thing done here was to take off  the goloshes, upon which thesoul was instantly obliged to return, and it took the  direct road tothe body at once, and in a few seconds the man\\'s life returned to him.He  declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been themost dreadful night  he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds wouldhe go through such feelings again.\"\\n However, it was all over now.\"\\n The same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes remained atthe hospital.\"\\n THE EVENTFUL MOMENT - A MOST UNUSUAL JOURNEY  Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows what the entrance toFrederick\\'s Hospital is like;  but as most probably a few of thosewho read this little tale may not reside in  Copenhagen, we will give ashort description of it.\"\\n The hospital is separated from the street by an iron railing, inwhich the bars stand  so wide apart that, it is said, some very slimpatients have squeezed through, and  gone to pay little visits in thetown.\"\\nThe most difficult part of the body to get through  was the head;and in this case, as it often happens in the world, the small headswere  the most fortunate.\"\\nThis will serve as sufficient introduction toour tale.\"\\nOne of  the young volunteers, of whom, physically speaking,it might be said that he had a  great head, was on guard that eveningat the hospital.\"\\nThe rain was pouring down, yet,  in spite of these twoobstacles, he wanted to go out just for a quarter of an hour;  it wasnot worth while, he thought, to make a confidant of the porter, ashe could easily  slip through the iron railings.\"\\nThere lay thegoloshes, which the watchman had  forgotten.\"\\nIt never occurred to himthat these could be goloshes of Fortune.\"\\nThey would  be veryserviceable to him in this rainy weather, so he drew them on.\"\\nNow camethe  question whether he could squeeze through the palings; hecertainly had never tried,  so he stood looking at them.\"\\n\"I wish togoodness my head was through,\" said he, and  instantly, though it wasso thick and large, it slipped through quite easily.\"\\nThe  goloshesanswered that purpose very well, but his body had to follow, andthis was  impossible.\"\\n\"I am too fat,\" he said; \"I thought my head wouldbe the worst, but I cannot  get my body through, that is certain.\"\\n Thenhe tried to pull his head back again, but  without success; he couldmove his neck about easily enough, and that was all.\"\\nHis  first feelingwas one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero.\"\\nThe goloshesof  Fortune had placed him in this terrible position, and unfortunatelyit never occurred  to him to wish himself free.\"\\nNo, instead ofwishing he kept twisting about, yet did  not stir from the spot.\"\\nTherain poured, and not a creature could be seen in the street.\"\\n Theporter\\'s bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose!He foresaw  that he should have to stay there till morning, and thenthey must send for a smith  to file away the iron bars, and thatwould be a work of time.\"\\nAll the charity children  would just begoing to school: and all the sailors who inhabited that quarter of thetown  would be there to see him standing in the pillory.\"\\nWhat a crowdthere would be.\"\\n\"Ha,\"  he cried, \"the blood is rushing to my head,and I shall go mad.\"\\nI believe I am crazy  already; oh, I wish I werefree, then all these sensations would pass off.\"\\n This is  just whathe ought to have said at first.\"\\nThe moment he had expressed thethought his  head was free.\"\\nHe started back, quite bewildered withthe fright which the goloshes  of Fortune had caused him.\"\\nBut we mustnot suppose it was all over; no, indeed, there  was worse to comeyet.\"\\nThe night passed, and the whole of the following day; but noone  sent for the goloshes.\"\\nIn the evening a declamatory performancewas to take place at  the amateur theatre in a distant street.\"\\nThehouse was crowded; among the audience  was the young volunteer from thehospital, who seemed to have quite forgotten his  adventures of theprevious evening.\"\\nHe had on the goloshes; they had not been sentfor,  and as the streets were still very dirty, they were of greatservice to him.\"\\nA new  poem, entitled \"My Aunt\\'s Spectacles,\" was beingrecited.\"\\nIt described these  spectacles as possessing a wonderfulpower; if any one put them on in a large assembly  the peopleappeared like cards, and the future events of ensuing years could beeasily  foretold by them.\"\\nThe idea struck him that he should verymuch like to have such a  pair of spectacles; for, if used rightly,they would perhaps enable him to see into  the hearts of people,which he thought would be more interesting than to know what  was goingto happen next year; for future events would be sure to showthemselves, but  the hearts of people never.\"\\n\"I can fancy what I shouldsee in the whole row of ladies  and gentlemen on the first seat, if Icould only look into their hearts; that lady,  I imagine, keeps a storefor things of all descriptions; how my eyes would wander about  in thatcollection; with many ladies I should no doubt find a largemillinery  establishment.\"\\nThere is another that is perhaps empty, andwould be all the better  for cleaning out.\"\\nThere may be some wellstored with good articles.\"\\nAh, yes,\" he sighed,  \"I know one, inwhich everything is solid, but a servant is there already, and that  isthe only thing against it.\"\\nI dare say from many I should hear thewords, \\'Please  to walk in.\\' I only wish I could slip into the heartslike a little tiny thought.\"\\n  This was the word of command for thegoloshes.\"\\nThe volunteer shrunk up together, and  commenced a mostunusual journey through the hearts of the spectators in the first  row.The first heart he entered was that of a lady, but he thought hemust have got  into one of the rooms of an orthopedic institution whereplaster casts of deformed  limbs were hanging on the walls, with thisdifference, that the casts in the  institution are formed when thepatient enters, but here they were formed and preserved  after the goodpeople had left.\"\\nThese were casts of the bodily and mental deformitiesof  the lady\\'s female friends carefully preserved.\"\\nQuickly he passedinto another heart,  which had the appearance of a spacious, holychurch, with the white dove of innocence  fluttering over the altar.Gladly would he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred  place; buthe was carried on to another heart, still, however, listening to thetones  of the organ, and feeling himself that he had become another anda better man.\"\\nThe  next heart was also a sanctuary, which he feltalmost unworthy to enter; it represented  a mean garret, in which lay asick mother; but the warm sunshine streamed through the  window, lovelyroses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof, two blue birds sangof  childlike joys, and the sick mother prayed for a blessing on herdaughter.\"\\nNext he  crept on his hands and knees through an overfilledbutcher\\'s shop; there was meat,  nothing but meat, wherever he stepped;this was the heart of a rich, respectable man,  whose name is doubtlessin the directory.\"\\nThen he entered the heart of this man\\'s wife;  it wasan old, tumble-down pigeon-house; the husband\\'s portrait served as  aweather-cock; it was connected with all the doors, which opened andshut just as the  husband\\'s decision turned.\"\\nThe next heart was acomplete cabinet of mirrors, such as  can be seen in the Castle ofRosenberg.\"\\nBut these mirrors magnified in an astonishing  degree; inthe middle of the floor sat, like the Grand Lama, the insignificantI of  the owner, astonished at the contemplation of his own features.At his next visit he  fancied he must have got into a narrowneedlecase, full of sharp needles: \"Oh,\" thought  he, \"this must be theheart of an old maid;\" but such was not the fact; it belonged  to ayoung officer, who wore several orders, and was said to be a man ofintellect and  heart.\"\\n The poor volunteer came out of the last heart in the row quitebewildered.\"\\nHe could  not collect his thoughts, and imagined hisfoolish fancies had carried him away.\"\\n\"Good  gracious!\"\\n he sighed, \"Imust have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it  is soexceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head.\"\\n And thensuddenly recurred  to him the strange event of the evening before, whenhis head had been fixed between  the iron railings in front of thehospital.\"\\n\"That is the cause of it all!\"\\n he exclaimed,  \"I must dosomething in time.\"\\nA Russian bath would be a very good thing tobegin with.\"\\n I wish I were lying on one of the highest shelves.\"\\n Sureenough, there he lay on an  upper shelf of a vapor bath, still in hisevening costume, with his boots and goloshes  on, and the hot dropsfrom the ceiling falling on his face.\"\\n\"Ho!\"\\n he cried, jumping  down andrushing towards the plunging bath.\"\\nThe attendant stopped him with aloud cry,  when he saw a man with all his clothes on.\"\\nThe volunteerhad, however, presence of  mind enough to whisper, \"It is for a wager;\"but the first thing he did, when he reached  his own room, was to put alarge blister on his neck, and another on his back, that  his crazy fitmight be cured.\"\\nThe next morning his back was very sore, which was allhe  gained by the goloshes of Fortune.\"\\n THE CLERK\\'S TRANSFORMATION  The watchman, whom we of course have not forgotten, thought, aftera while, of the  goloshes which he had found and taken to the hospital;so he went and fetched them.\"\\n But neither the lieutenant nor any one inthe street could recognize them as their  own, so he gave them up tothe police.\"\\n\"They look exactly like my own goloshes,\" said  one ofthe clerks, examining the unknown articles, as they stood by theside of his  own.\"\\n\"It would require even more than the eye of ashoemaker to know one pair from  the other.\"\\n  \"Master clerk,\" said a servant who entered with some papers.\"\\nTheclerk turned and spoke  to the man; but when he had done with him, heturned to look at the goloshes again,  and now he was in greaterdoubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or on  the leftbelonged to him.\"\\n\"Those that are wet must be mine,\" thought he; but hethought  wrong, it was just the reverse.\"\\nThe goloshes of Fortune werethe wet pair; and, besides,  why should not a clerk in a policeoffice be wrong sometimes?\"\\nSo he drew them on, thrust  his papersinto his pocket, placed a few manuscripts under his arm, which hehad to  take with him, and to make abstracts from at home.\"\\nThen, asit was Sunday morning and  the weather very fine, he said to himself,\"A walk to Fredericksburg will do me good:\"  so away he went.\"\\n There could not be a quieter or more steady young man than thisclerk.\"\\nWe will not  grudge him this little walk, it was just thething to do him good after sitting so  much.\"\\nHe went on at first like amere automaton, without thought or wish; therefore  the goloshes had noopportunity to display their magic power.\"\\nIn the avenue he met  with anacquaintance, one of our young poets, who told him that he intended tostart  on the following day on a summer excursion.\"\\n\"Are you reallygoing away so soon?\"\\n asked  the clerk.\"\\n\"What a free, happy man you are.You can roam about where you will, while  such as we are tied by thefoot.\"\\n  \"But it is fastened to the bread-tree,\" replied the poet.\"\\n\"Youneed have no anxiety  for the morrow; and when you are old there is apension for you.\"\\n  \"Ah, yes; but you have the best of it,\" said the clerk; \"it mustbe so delightful to  sit and write poetry.\"\\nThe whole world makes itselfagreeable to you, and then you are  your own master.\"\\nYou should try howyou would like to listen to all the trivial things  in a court ofjustice.\"\\n The poet shook his head, so also did the clerk; eachretained  his own opinion, and so they parted.\"\\n\"They are strangepeople, these poets,\" thought  the clerk.\"\\n\"I should like to try what itis to have a poetic taste, and to become a  poet myself.\"\\nI am sure Ishould not write such mournful verses as they do.\"\\nThis is  a splendidspring day for a poet, the air is so remarkably clear, the cloudsare so  beautiful, and the green grass has such a sweet smell.\"\\nFor manyyears I have not felt  as I do at this moment.\"\\n  We perceive, by these remarks, that he had already become apoet.\"\\nBy most poets what  he had said would be considered common-place,or as the Germans call it, \"insipid.\"\\n  It is a foolish fancy to lookupon poets as different to other men.\"\\nThere are many  who are morethe poets of nature than those who are professed poets.\"\\nThe differenceis  this, the poet\\'s intellectual memory is better; he seizes upon anidea or a sentiment,  until he can embody it, clearly and plainly inwords, which the others cannot do.\"\\nBut  the transition from a characterof every-day life to one of a more gifted nature is  a greattransition; and so the clerk became aware of the change after atime.\"\\n\"What  a delightful perfume,\" said he; \"it reminds me of theviolets at Aunt Lora\\'s.\"\\nAh, that  was when I was a little boy.\"\\nDear me,how long it seems since I thought of those days!\"\\n She was a good oldmaiden lady!\"\\nshe lived yonder, behind the Exchange.\"\\nShe always had  asprig or a few blossoms in water, let the winter be ever so severe.I could smell  the violets, even while I was placing warm pennypieces against the frozen panes to  make peep-holes, and a prettyview it was on which I peeped.\"\\nOut in the river lay the  ships,icebound, and forsaken by their crews; a screaming crow representedthe only  living creature on board.\"\\nBut when the breezes of springcame, everything started into  life.\"\\nAmidst shouting and cheers theships were tarred and rigged, and then they sailed  to foreign lands.\"\\n \"I remain here, and always shall remain, sitting at my post at thepolice office, and  letting others take passports to distant lands.Yes, this is my fate,\" and he sighed  deeply.\"\\nSuddenly he paused.\"\\n\"Goodgracious, what has come over me?\"\\nI never felt before  as I do now; itmust be the air of spring.\"\\nIt is overpowering, and yet it isdelightful.\"\\n  He felt in his pockets for some of his papers.\"\\n\"These will give mesomething else to  think of,\" said he.\"\\nCasting his eyes on the firstpage of one, he read, \"\\'Mistress  Sigbirth; an original Tragedy, inFive Acts.\\' What is this?- in my own handwriting,  too!\"\\nHave Iwritten this tragedy?\"\\n He read again, \"\\'The Intrigue on the Promenade;or,  the Fast-Day.\"\\nA Vaudeville.\\' However did I get all this?\"\\nSomeone must have put them  into my pocket.\"\\nAnd here is a letter!\"\\n It wasfrom the manager of a theatre; the pieces  were rejected, not at all inpolite terms.\"\\n \"Hem, hem!\"\\n said he, sitting down on a bench; his thoughts werevery elastic, and his  heart softened strangely.\"\\nInvoluntarily heseized one of the nearest flowers; it was  a little, simple daisy.All that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in  amoment by this little flower.\"\\nIt spoke of the glory of its birth; ittold of the  strength of the sunlight, which had caused its delicateleaves to expand, and given  to it such sweet perfume.\"\\nThe struggles oflife which arouse sensations in the bosom  have their type in thetiny flowers.\"\\nAir and light are the lovers of the flowers, but  lightis the favored one; towards light it turns, and only when lightvanishes does  it fold its leaves together, and sleep in the embracesof the air.\"\\n  \"It is light that adorns me,\" said the flower.\"\\n \"But the air gives you the breath of life,\" whispered the poet.\"\\n Just by him stood a boy, splashing with his stick in a marshyditch.\"\\nThe water-drops  spurted up among the green twigs, and the clerkthought of the millions of animalculae  which were thrown into theair with every drop of water, at a height which must be  the same tothem as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the clouds.\"\\nAsthe clerk  thought of all these things, and became conscious of thegreat change in his own  feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, \"Imust be asleep and dreaming; and yet,  if so, how wonderful for a dreamto be so natural and real, and to know at the same  time too that it isbut a dream.\"\\nI hope I shall be able to remember it all when I  waketomorrow.\"\\nMy sensations seem most unaccountable.\"\\nI have a clearperception of  everything as if I were wide awake.\"\\nI am quite sure if Irecollect all this tomorrow,  it will appear utterly ridiculous andabsurd.\"\\nI have had this happen to me before.\"\\n It is with the cleveror wonderful things we say or hear in dreams, as with the gold  whichcomes from under the earth, it is rich and beautiful when we possessit, but when  seen in a true light it is but as stones and witheredleaves.\"\\n  \"Ah!\"\\n he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singingmerrily, or hopping from  branch to branch, \"they are much better offthan I.\"\\nFlying is a glorious power.\"\\nHappy  is he who is born withwings.\"\\nYes, if I could change myself into anything I would be  a littlelark.\"\\n At the same moment his coat-tails and sleeves grew together andformed  wings, his clothes changed to feathers, and his goloshes toclaws.\"\\nHe felt what was  taking place, and laughed to himself.\"\\n\"Well,now it is evident I must be dreaming;  but I never had such a wilddream as this.\"\\n And then he flew up into the green boughs  and sang,but there was no poetry in the song, for his poetic nature had lefthim.\"\\nThe  goloshes, like all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly,could only attend to  one thing at a time.\"\\nHe wished to be a poet,and he became one.\"\\nThen he wanted to be  a little bird, and in thischange he lost the characteristics of the former one.\"\\n \"Well,\"thought he, \"this is charming; by day I sit in a police-office,amongst the  dryest law papers, and at night I can dream that I am alark, flying about in the gardens  of Fredericksburg.\"\\nReally a completecomedy could be written about it.\"\\n Then he flew  down into the grass,turned his head about in every direction, and tapped his beak  on thebending blades of grass, which, in proportion to his size, seemed tohim as long  as the palm-leaves in northern Africa.\"\\n In another moment all was darkness around him.\"\\nIt seemed as ifsomething immense had  been thrown over him.\"\\nA sailor boy had flung hislarge cap over the bird, and a hand  came underneath and caught theclerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he squeaked,  and thencried out in his alarm, \"You impudent rascal, I am a clerk in  thepolice-office!\"\\n but it only sounded to the boy like \"tweet, tweet;\" sohe tapped  the bird on the beak, and walked away with him.\"\\nIn theavenue he met two school-boys,  who appeared to belong to a betterclass of society, but whose inferior abilities kept  them in the lowestclass at school.\"\\nThese boys bought the bird for eightpence, and  so theclerk returned to Copenhagen.\"\\n\"It is well for me that I amdreaming,\" he thought;  \"otherwise I should become really angry.First I was a poet, and now I am a lark.\"\\nIt  must have been thepoetic nature that changed me into this little creature.\"\\nIt is  amiserable story indeed, especially now I have fallen into the hands ofboys.\"\\nI wonder  what will be the end of it.\"\\n The boys carried himinto a very elegant room, where a  stout, pleasant-looking ladyreceived them, but she was not at all gratified to find  that theyhad brought a lark- a common field-bird as she called it.\"\\nHowever, sheallowed  them for one day to place the bird in an empty cage thathung near the window.\"\\n\"It  will please Polly perhaps,\" she said,laughing at a large gray parrot, who was swinging  himself proudly on aring in a handsome brass cage.\"\\n\"It is Polly\\'s birthday,\" she  addedin a simpering tone, \"and the little field-bird has come to offerhis  congratulations.\"\\n  Polly did not answer a single word, he continued to swingproudly to and fro; but a  beautiful canary, who had been broughtfrom his own warm, fragrant fatherland, the  summer previous, beganto sing as loud as he could.\"\\n \"You screamer!\"\\n said the lady, throwing a white handkerchiefover the cage.\"\\n \"Tweet, tweet,\" sighed he, \"what a dreadful snowstorm!\"\\n and thenhe became silent.\"\\n The clerk, or as the lady called him the field-bird, was placed ina little cage close  to the canary, and not far from the parrot.\"\\nTheonly human speech which Polly could  utter, and which she sometimeschattered forth most comically, was \"Now let us be men.\"\\n  All besideswas a scream, quite as unintelligible as the warbling of thecanary-bird,  excepting to the clerk, who being now a bird, couldunderstand his comrades very well.\"\\n \"I flew beneath green palm-trees, and amidst the bloomingalmond-trees,\" sang the  canary.\"\\n\"I flew with my brothers and sistersover beautiful flowers, and across the  clear, bright sea, whichreflected the waving foliage in its glittering depths; and  I have seenmany gay parrots, who could relate long and delightful stories.\"\\n \"They were wild birds,\" answered the parrot, \"and totallyuneducated.\"\\nNow let us be  men.\"\\nWhy do you not laugh?\"\\nIf the lady andher visitors can laugh at this, surely you  can.\"\\nIt is a greatfailing not to be able to appreciate what is amusing.\"\\nNow let us  bemen.\"\\n  \"Do you remember,\" said the canary, \"the pretty maidens who usedto dance in the tents  that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms?Do you remember the delicious fruit  and the cooling juice from thewild herbs?\"\\n  \"Oh, yes,\" said the parrot; \"but here I am much better off.\"\\nI amwell fed, and treated  politely.\"\\nI know that I have a clever head;and what more do I want?\"\\nLet us be men  now.\"\\nYou have a soul forpoetry.\"\\nI have deep knowledge and wit.\"\\nYou have genius, but  nodiscretion.\"\\nYou raise your naturally high notes so much, that youget covered over.\"\\n They never serve me so.\"\\nOh, no; I cost themsomething more than you.\"\\nI keep them in  order with my beak, andfling my wit about me.\"\\nNow let us be men.\"\\n \"O my warm, blooming fatherland,\" sang the canary bird, \"I willsing of thy dark-green  trees and thy quiet streams, where thebending branches kiss the clear, smooth water.\"\\n I will sing of thejoy of my brothers and sisters, as their shining plumage flits  amongthe dark leaves of the plants which grow wild by the springs.\"\\n  \"Do leave off those dismal strains,\" said the parrot; \"singsomething to make us laugh;  laughter is the sign of the highestorder of intellect.\"\\nCan a dog or a horse laugh?\"\\n No, they can cry;but to man alone is the power of laughter given.\"\\nHa!\"\\nha!\"\\nha!\"\\nlaughed  Polly, and repeated his witty saying, \"Now let us be men.\"\\n  \"You little gray Danish bird,\" said the canary, \"you also havebecome a prisoner.\"\\nIt  is certainly cold in your forests, but stillthere is liberty there.\"\\nFly out!\"\\nthey  have forgotten to close thecage, and the window is open at the top.\"\\nFly, fly!\"\\n  Instinctively, the clerk obeyed, and left the cage; at the samemoment the half-opened  door leading into the next room creaked onits hinges, and, stealthily, with green  fiery eyes, the cat crept inand chased the lark round the room.\"\\nThe canary-bird  fluttered in hiscage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, \"Let us be men;\"  thepoor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, overthe houses,  and through the streets, till at length he was obligedto seek a resting-place.\"\\nA house  opposite to him had a look of home.\"\\nAwindow stood open; he flew in, and perched upon  the table.\"\\nIt washis own room.\"\\n\"Let us be men now,\" said he, involuntarily imitatingthe  parrot; and at the same moment he became a clerk again, onlythat he was sitting on  the table.\"\\n\"Heaven preserve us!\"\\n said he;\"How did I get up here and fall asleep in  this way?\"\\nIt was an uneasydream too that I had.\"\\nThe whole affair appears most absurd.\"\\n THE BEST THING THE GOLOSHES DID  Early on the following morning, while the clerk was still inbed, his neighbor, a young  divinity student, who lodged on the samestorey, knocked at his door, and then walked  in.\"\\n\"Lend me yourgoloshes,\" said he; \"it is so wet in the garden, but the sun isshining  brightly.\"\\nI should like to go out there and smoke my pipe.\"\\n Heput on the goloshes,  and was soon in the garden, which containedonly one plum-tree and one apple-tree;  yet, in a town, even a smallgarden like this is a great advantage.\"\\n The student wandered up and down the path; it was just sixo\\'clock, and he could hear  the sound of the post-horn in the street.\"\\nOh, to travel, to travel!\"\\n cried he; \"there  is no greater happinessin the world: it is the height of my ambition.\"\\nThis restless  feelingwould be stilled, if I could take a journey far away from thiscountry.\"\\nI should  like to see beautiful Switzerland, to travel throughItaly, and,\"- It was well for  him that the goloshes acted immediately,otherwise he might have been carried too far  for himself as well asfor us.\"\\nIn a moment he found himself in Switzerland, closely  packedwith eight others in the diligence.\"\\nHis head ached, his back wasstiff, and the  blood had ceased to circulate, so that his feet wereswelled and pinched by his boots.\"\\n He wavered in a condition betweensleeping and waking.\"\\nIn his right-hand pocket he  had a letter ofcredit; in his left-hand pocket was his passport; and a few louisd\\'ors  were sewn into a little leather bag which he carried in hisbreast-pocket.\"\\nWhenever  he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one oranother of these possessions; then he  would awake with a start, andthe first movements of his hand formed a triangle from  hisright-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to hisleft-hand pocket, to  feel whether they were all safe.\"\\nUmbrellas,sticks, and hats swung in the net before  him, and almost obstructedthe prospect, which was really very imposing; and as he  glanced at it,his memory recalled the words of one poet at least, who has sung  ofSwitzerland, and whose poems have not yet been printed:-  \"How lovely to my wondering eyes  Mont Blanc\\'s fair summits gently rise;  \\'Tis sweet to breathe the mountain air,-  If you have gold enough to spare.\"\\nGrand, dark, and gloomy appeared the landscape  around him.\"\\nThepine-forests looked like little groups of moss on high rocks,  whosesummits were lost in clouds of mist.\"\\nPresently it began to snow, andthe wind  blew keen and cold.\"\\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, \"if I were only on theother side of the Alps  now, it would be summer, and I should be ableto get money on my letter of credit.\"\\n The anxiety I feel on this matterprevents me from enjoying myself in Switzerland.\"\\n Oh, I wish I was onthe other side of the Alps.\"\\n  And there, in a moment, he found himself, far away in the midst ofItaly, between  Florence and Rome, where the lake Thrasymeneglittered in the evening sunlight like  a sheet of molten goldbetween the dark blue mountains.\"\\nThere, where Hannibal  defeatedFlaminius, the grape vines clung to each other with the friendly graspof their  green tendril fingers; while, by the wayside, lovelyhalf-naked children were watching  a herd of coal-black swine under theblossoms of fragrant laurel.\"\\nCould we rightly  describe thispicturesque scene, our readers would exclaim, \"Delightful Italy!\"\\n  But neither the student nor either of his travelling companionsfelt the least  inclination to think of it in this way.\"\\nPoisonous fliesand gnats flew into the coach  by thousands.\"\\nIn vain they drove themaway with a myrtle branch, the flies stung them  notwithstanding.\"\\nTherewas not a man in the coach whose face was not swollen and  disfiguredwith the stings.\"\\nThe poor horses looked wretched; the flies settled ontheir  backs in swarms, and they were only relieved when the coachmengot down and drove the  creatures off.\"\\n As the sun set, an icy coldness filled all nature, not howeverof long duration.\"\\nIt  produced the feeling which we experience whenwe enter a vault at a funeral, on a  summer\\'s day; while the hillsand the clouds put on that singular green hue which we  often notice inold paintings, and look upon as unnatural until we have ourselves  seennature\\'s coloring in the south.\"\\nIt was a glorious spectacle; but thestomachs of  the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted withfatigue, and all the longings  of their heart turned towards aresting-place for the night; but where to find one  they knew not.All the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this resting-place, tonotice  the beauties of nature.\"\\n The road passed through a grove of olive-trees; it reminded thestudent of the  willow-trees at home.\"\\nHere stood a lonely inn, andclose by it a number of crippled  beggars had placed themselves; thebrightest among them looked, to quote the words  of Marryat, \"likethe eldest son of Famine who had just come of age.\"\\n The others  wereeither blind, or had withered legs, which obliged them to creepabout on their  hands and knees, or they had shrivelled arms andhands without fingers.\"\\nIt was indeed  poverty arrayed in rags.\"\\nEccellenza, miserabili!\"\\n they exclaimed, stretching forth  theirdiseased limbs.\"\\nThe hostess received the travellers with bare feet,untidy hair,  and a dirty blouse.\"\\nThe doors were fastened together withstring; the floors of the  rooms were of brick, broken in manyplaces; bats flew about under the roof; and as  to the odor within-  \"Let us have supper laid in the stable,\" said one of thetravellers; \"then we shall  know what we are breathing.\"\\n  The windows were opened to let in a little fresh air, butquicker than air came in  the withered arms and the continual whiningsounds, \"Miserabili, eccellenza.\"\\nOn the  walls were inscriptions,half of them against \"la bella Italia.\"\\n  The supper made its appearance at last.\"\\nIt consisted of waterysoup, seasoned with  pepper and rancid oil.\"\\nThis last delicacy played aprincipal part in the salad.\"\\nMusty  eggs and roasted cocks\\'-combswere the best dishes on the table; even the wine had  a strangetaste, it was certainly a mixture.\"\\nAt night, all the boxes were placedagainst  the doors, and one of the travellers watched while theothers slept.\"\\nThe student\\'s  turn came to watch.\"\\nHow close the air feltin that room; the heat overpowered him.\"\\n The gnats were buzzing aboutand stinging, while the miserabili, outside, moaned in  their dreams.\"\\n \"Travelling would be all very well,\" said the student ofdivinity to himself, \"if we  had no bodies, or if the body could restwhile the soul if flying.\"\\nWherever I go I  feel a want whichoppresses my heart, for something better presents itself at themoment;  yes, something better, which shall be the best of all; butwhere is that to be found?\"\\n In fact, I know in my heart very wellwhat I want.\"\\nI wish to attain the greatest of  all happiness.\"\\n  No sooner were the words spoken than he was at home.\"\\nLong whitecurtains shaded the  windows of his room, and in the middle of thefloor stood a black coffin, in which  he now lay in the still sleepof death; his wish was fulfilled, his body was at rest,  and his spirittravelling.\"\\n \"Esteem no man happy until he is in his grave,\" were the wordsof Solon.\"\\nHere was a  strong fresh proof of their truth.\"\\nEvery corpseis a sphinx of immortality.\"\\nThe sphinx  in this sarcophagus mightunveil its own mystery in the words which the living had  himselfwritten two days before-  \"Stern death, thy chilling silence waketh dread;  Yet in thy darkest hour there may be light.\"\\n Earth\\'s garden reaper!\"\\nfrom the grave\\'s cold bed  The soul on Jacob\\'s ladder takes her flight.\"\\n Man\\'s greatest sorrows often are a part  Of hidden griefs, concealed from human eyes,  Which press far heavier on the lonely heart  Than now the earth that on his coffin lies.\"\\n  Two figures were moving about the room; we know them both.\"\\nOne wasthe fairy named  Care, the other the messenger of Fortune.\"\\nThey bentover the dead.\"\\n \"Look!\"\\n said Care; \"what happiness have your goloshes brought tomankind?\"\\n  \"They have at least brought lasting happiness to him whoslumbers here,\" she said.\"\\n \"Not so,\" said Care, \"he went away of himself, he was notsummoned.\"\\nHis mental powers  were not strong enough to discern thetreasures which he had been destined to discover.\"\\n I will do him afavor now.\"\\n And she drew the goloshes from his feet.\"\\n The sleep of death was ended, and the recovered man raisedhimself.\"\\nCare vanished,  and with her the goloshes; doubtless shelooked upon them as her own property.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE HAPPY FAMILY  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE largest green leaf in this country is certainly theburdock-leaf.\"\\nIf you hold it  in front of you, it is large enough foran apron; and if you hold it over your head,  it is almost as good asan umbrella, it is so wonderfully large.\"\\nA burdock never  growsalone; where it grows, there are many more, and it is a splendidsight; and all  this splendor is good for snails.\"\\nThe great whitesnails, which grand people in olden  times used to have made intofricassees; and when they had eaten them, they would say,  \"O, what adelicious dish!\"\\n for these people really thought them good; andthese snails  lived on burdock-leaves, and for them the burdock wasplanted.\"\\n There was once an old estate where no one now lived to requiresnails; indeed, the  owners had all died out, but the burdock stillflourished; it grew over all the beds  and walks of the garden- itsgrowth had no check- till it became at last quite a forest  ofburdocks.\"\\nHere and there stood an apple or a plum-tree; but forthis, nobody would  have thought the place had ever been a garden.\"\\nItwas burdock from one end to the other;  and here lived the last twosurviving snails.\"\\nThey knew not themselves how old they  were; but theycould remember the time when there were a great many more of them,  andthat they were descended from a family which came from foreignlands, and that the  whole forest had been planted for them and theirs.They had never been away from the  garden; but they knew that anotherplace once existed in the world, called the Duke\\'s  Palace Castle, inwhich some of their relations had been boiled till they becameblack,  and were then laid on a silver dish; but what was doneafterwards they did not know.\"\\n Besides, they could not imagineexactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver  dish; but nodoubt it was something very fine and highly genteel.\"\\nNeither thecockchafer,  nor the toad, nor the earth-worm, whom they questionedabout it, would give them the  least information; for none of theirrelations had ever been cooked or served on a  silver dish.\"\\nThe oldwhite snails were the most aristocratic race in the world,-  theyknew that.\"\\nThe forest had been planted for them, and the nobleman\\'scastle had  been built entirely that they might be cooked and laid onsilver dishes.\"\\n They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had nochildren of their own,  they had adopted a little common snail, whichthey brought up as their own child.\"\\nThe  little one would not grow, forhe was only a common snail; but the old people,  particularly themother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew; and  whenthe father said he could not perceive it, she begged him to feel thelittle snail\\'s  shell, and he did so, and found that the mother wasright.\"\\n One day it rained very fast.\"\\n\"Listen, what a drumming there ison the burdock-leaves;  turn, turn, turn; turn, turn, turn,\" said thefather-snail.\"\\n \"There come the drops,\" said the mother; \"they are tricklingdown the stalks.\"\\nWe shall  have it very wet here presently.\"\\nI am veryglad we have such good houses, and that  the little one has one ofhis own.\"\\nThere has been really more done for us than for  any othercreature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in theworld.\"\\n We have houses from our birth, and the burdock forest hasbeen planted for us.\"\\nI should  very much like to know how far itextends, and what lies beyond it.\"\\n  \"There can be nothing better than we have here,\" said thefather-snail; \"I wish for  nothing more.\"\\n  \"Yes, but I do,\" said the mother; \"I should like to be taken tothe palace, and boiled,  and laid upon a silver dish, as was done toall our ancestors; and you may be sure  it must be something veryuncommon.\"\\n  \"The nobleman\\'s castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay,\" said thesnail-father, or the  burdock wood may have grown out.\"\\nYou need notbe in a hurry; you are always so impatient,  and the youngster isgetting just the same.\"\\nHe has been three days creeping to the  top ofthat stalk.\"\\nI feel quite giddy when I look at him.\"\\n  \"You must not scold him,\" said the mother-snail; \"he creeps sovery carefully.\"\\nHe will  be the joy of our home; and we old folkshave nothing else to live for.\"\\nBut have you  ever thought where weare to get a wife for him?\"\\nDo you think that farther out in the  woodthere may be others of our race?\"\\n  \"There may be black snails, no doubt,\" said the old snail;\"black snails without houses;  but they are so vulgar and conceitedtoo.\"\\nBut we can give the ants a commission; they  run here and there,as if they all had so much business to get through.\"\\nThey, most  likely,will know of a wife for our youngster.\"\\n  \"I certainly know a most beautiful bride,\" said one of the ants;\"but I fear it would  not do, for she is a queen.\"\\n  \"That does not matter,\" said the old snail; \"has she a house?\"\\n  \"She has a palace,\" replied the ant,- \"a most beautiful ant-palacewith seven hundred  passages.\"\\n  \"Thank-you,\" said the mother-snail; \"but our boy shall not go tolive in an ant-hill.\"\\n If you know of nothing better, we will give thecommission to the white gnats; they  fly about in rain and sunshine;they know the burdock wood from one end to the other.\"\\n  \"We have a wife for him,\" said the gnats; \"a hundred man-stepsfrom here there is a  little snail with a house, sitting on agooseberry-bush; she is quite alone, and old  enough to be married.It is only a hundred man-steps from here.\"\\n  \"Then let her come to him,\" said the old people.\"\\n\"He has the wholeburdock forest;  she has only a bush.\"\\n  So they brought the little lady-snail.\"\\nShe took eight days toperform the journey;  but that was just as it ought to be; for itshowed her to be one of the right breeding.\"\\n And then they had awedding.\"\\nSix glow-worms gave as much light as they could; but in  otherrespects it was all very quiet; for the old snails could not bearfestivities  or a crowd.\"\\nBut a beautiful speech was made by themother-snail.\"\\nThe father could not  speak; he was too much overcome.Then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young  snails as aninheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it was  thefinest place in the world, and that if they led upright andhonorable lives, and  their family increased, they and their childrenmight some day be taken to the  nobleman\\'s palace, to be boiledblack, and laid on a silver dish.\"\\nAnd when they had  finished speaking,the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no more; for  theyslept.\"\\n The young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a numerousprogeny.\"\\nBut as the  young ones were never boiled or laid in silverdishes, they concluded that the castle  had fallen into decay, and thatall the people in the world were dead; and as nobody  contradictedthem, they thought they must be right.\"\\nAnd the rain fell upon  theburdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone topaint colors on  the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy;the whole family were entirely  and perfectly happy.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE ICE MAIDEN  by Hans Christian Andersen  I.\"\\nLITTLE RUDY  WE will pay a visit to Switzerland, and wander through thatcountry of mountains, whose  steep and rocky sides are overgrown withforest trees.\"\\nLet us climb to the dazzling  snow-fields at theirsummits, and descend again to the green meadows beneath, through  whichrivers and brooks rush along as if they could not quickly enough reachthe sea  and vanish.\"\\nFiercely shines the sun over those deep valleys,as well as upon the heavy  masses of snow which lie on the mountains.\"\\n During the year these accumulations thaw or fall in the rollingavalance, or are piled  up in shining glaciers.\"\\nTwo of these glacierslie in the broad, rocky cliffs, between  the Schreckhorn and theWetterhorn, near the little town of Grindelwald.\"\\nThey are  wonderful tobehold, and therefore in the summer time strangers come here fromall parts  of the world to see them.\"\\nThey cross snow-covered mountains,and travel through the  deep valleys, or ascend for hours, higher andstill higher, the valleys appearing to  sink lower and lower as theyproceed, and become as small as if seen from an air balloon.\"\\n Overthe lofty summits of these mountains the clouds often hang like a darkveil; while  beneath in the valley, where many brown, wooden houses arescattered about, the bright  rays of the sun may be shining upon alittle brilliant patch of green, making it appear  almosttransparent.\"\\nThe waters foam and dash along in the valleys beneath;the streams  from above trickle and murmur as they fall down therocky mountain\\'s side, looking  like glittering silver bands.\"\\n On both sides of the mountain-path stand these little woodenhouses; and, as within,  there are many children and many mouths tofeed, each house has its own little potato  garden.\"\\nThese children rushout in swarms, and surround travellers, whether on foot  or incarriages.\"\\nThey are all clever at making a bargain.\"\\nThey offer forsale the  sweetest little toy-houses, models of the mountain cottagesin Switzerland.\"\\nWhether  it be rain or sunshine, these crowds ofchildren are always to be seen with their wares.\"\\n About twenty years ago, there might be seen occasionally, standingat a short distance  from the other children, a little boy, who wasalso anxious to sell his curious wares.\"\\n He had an earnest,expressive countenance, and held the box containing his carved  toystightly with both hands, as if unwilling to part with it.\"\\nHisearnest look, and  being also a very little boy, made him noticed bythe strangers; so that he often sold  the most, without knowing why.\"\\nAnhour\\'s walk farther up the ascent lived his  grandfather, who cut andcarved the pretty little toy-houses; and in the old man\\'s  room stood alarge press, full of all sorts of carved things- nut-crackers,knives and  forks, boxes with beautifully carved foliage, leapingchamois.\"\\nIt contained  everything that could delight the eyes of achild.\"\\nBut the boy, who was named Rudy,  looked with still greaterpleasure and longing at some old fire-arms which hung upon  therafters, under the ceiling of the room.\"\\nHis grandfather promised himthat he should  have them some day, but that he must first grow big andstrong, and learn how to use  them.\"\\nSmall as he was, the goats wereplaced in his care, and a good goat-keeper should  also be a goodclimber, and such Rudy was; he sometimes, indeed, climbed higherthan  the goats, for he was fond of seeking for birds\\'-nests at the topof high trees; he  was bold and daring, but was seldom seen to smile,excepting when he stood by the  roaring cataract, or heard thedescending roll of the avalanche.\"\\nHe never played with  the otherchildren, and was not seen with them, unless his grandfather senthim down  to sell his curious workmanship.\"\\nRudy did not much liketrade; he loved to climb the  mountains, or to sit by his grandfatherand listen to his tales of olden times, or  of the people in Meyringen,the place of his birth.\"\\n \"In the early ages of the world,\" said the old man, \"thesepeople could not be found  in Switzerland.\"\\nThey are a colony from thenorth, where their ancestors still dwell,  and are called Swedes.\"\\n  This was something for Rudy to know, but he learnt more from othersources,  particularly from the domestic animals who belonged to thehouse.\"\\nOne was a large dog,  called Ajola, which had belonged to hisfather; and the other was a tom-cat.\"\\nThis cat  stood very high inRudy\\'s favor, for he had taught him to climb.\"\\n \"Come out on the roof with me,\" said the cat; and Rudy quiteunderstood him, for the  language of fowls, ducks, cats, and dogs, isas easily understood by a young child  as his own native tongue.\"\\nBut itmust be at the age when grandfather\\'s stick becomes  a neighinghorse, with head, legs, and tail.\"\\nSome children retain these ideaslater  than others, and they are considered backwards and childishfor their age.\"\\nPeople say  so; but is it so?\"\\n \"Come out on the roof with me, little Rudy,\" was the first thinghe heard the cat say,  and Rudy understood him.\"\\n\"What people sayabout falling down is all nonsense,\"  continued the cat; \"you willnot fall, unless you are afraid.\"\\nCome, now, set one foot  here andanother there, and feel your way with your fore-feet.\"\\nKeep your eyeswide open,  and move softly, and if you come to a hole jump over it,and cling fast as I do.\"\\n And  this was just what Rudy did.\"\\nHe was oftenon the sloping roof with the cat, or on the  tops of high trees.\"\\nBut,more frequently, higher still on the ridges of the rocks where  pussnever came.\"\\n \"Higher, higher!\"\\n cried the trees and the bushes, \"see to whatheight we have grown,  and how fast we hold, even to the narrow edgesof the rocks.\"\\n  Rudy often reached the top of the mountain before the sunrise, andthere inhaled his  morning draught of the fresh, invigoratingmountain air,- God\\'s own gift, which men  call the sweet fragrance ofplant and herb on the mountain-side, and the mint and wild  thyme inthe valleys.\"\\nThe overhanging clouds absorb all heaviness from the air,and  the winds convey them away over the pine-tree summits.\"\\nThespirit of fragrance, light  and fresh, remained behind, and this wasRudy\\'s morning draught.\"\\nThe sunbeams- those  blessing-bringingdaughters of the sun- kissed his cheeks.\"\\nVertigo might be lurking  onthe watch, but he dared not approach him.\"\\nThe swallows, who had notless than seven  nests in his grandfather\\'s house, flew up to him andhis goats, singing, \"We and you,  you and we.\"\\n They brought himgreetings from his grandfather\\'s house, even from two  hens, the onlybirds of the household; but Rudy was not intimate with them.\"\\n Although so young and such a little fellow, Rudy had travelled agreat deal.\"\\nHe was  born in the canton of Valais, and brought to hisgrandfather over the mountains.\"\\nHe  had walked to Staubbach- a littletown that seems to flutter in the air like a silver  veil- theglittering, snow-clad mountain Jungfrau.\"\\nHe had also been to the  greatglaciers; but this is connected with a sad story, for here hismother met her  death, and his grandfather used to say that allRudy\\'s childish merriment was lost  from that time.\"\\nHis mother hadwritten in a letter, that before he was a year old he  had laughed morethan he cried; but after his fall into the snow-covered crevasse,his  disposition had completely changed.\"\\nThe grandfather seldom spokeof this, but the fact  was generally known.\"\\nRudy\\'s father had been apostilion, and the large dog which now  lived in his grandfather\\'scottage had always followed him on his journeys over the  Simplon tothe lake of Geneva.\"\\nRudy\\'s relations, on his father\\'s side, lived inthe  canton of Valais, in the valley of the Rhone.\"\\nHis uncle was achamois hunter, and a  well-known guide.\"\\nRudy was only a year oldwhen his father died, and his mother was  anxious to return with herchild to her own relations, who lived in the Bernese Oberland.\"\\n Herfather dwelt at a few hours\\' distance from Grindelwald; he was acarver in wood,  and gained so much by it that he had plenty to liveupon.\"\\nShe set out homewards in  the month of June, carrying herinfant in her arms, and, accompanied by two chamois  hunters, crossedthe Gemmi on her way to Grindelwald.\"\\nThey had already left more  thanhalf the journey behind them.\"\\nThey had crossed high ridges, andtraversed  snow-fields; they could even see her native valley, with itsfamiliar wooden cottages.\"\\n They had only one more glacier to climb.Some newly fallen snow concealed a cleft which,  though it did notextend to the foaming waters in the depths beneath, was still  muchdeeper than the height of a man.\"\\nThe young woman, with the child inher arms,  slipped upon it, sank in, and disappeared.\"\\nNot a shriek, nota groan was heard; nothing  but the whining of a little child.\"\\nMorethan an hour elapsed before her two companions  could obtain from thenearest house ropes and poles to assist in raising them; and  it waswith much exertion that they at last succeeded in raising from thecrevasse what  appeared to be two dead bodies.\"\\nEvery means was usedto restore them to life.\"\\nWith  the child they were successful, butnot with the mother; so the old grandfather  received his daughter\\'slittle son into his house an orphan,- a little boy who laughed  morethan he cried; but it seemed as if laughter had left him in the coldice-world  into which he had fallen, where, as the Swiss peasantssay, the souls of the lost are  confined till the judgment-day.\"\\n The glaciers appear as if a rushing stream had been frozen inits course, and pressed  into blocks of green crystal, which,balanced one upon another, form a wondrous palace  of crystal for theIce Maiden- the queen of the glaciers.\"\\nIt is she whose mighty  powercan crush the traveller to death, and arrest the flowing river inits course.\"\\n She is also a child of the air, and with the swiftnessof the chamois she can reach  the snow-covered mountain tops, where theboldest mountaineer has to cut footsteps  in the ice to ascend.\"\\nShewill sail on a frail pine-twig over the raging torrents  beneath, andspring lightly from one iceberg to another, with her long,snow-white hair  flowing around her, and her dark-green robe glitteringlike the waters of the deep  Swiss lakes.\"\\n\"Mine is the power to seizeand crush,\" she cried.\"\\n\"Once a beautiful boy  was stolen from me byman,- a boy whom I had kissed, but had not kissed to death.\"\\nHe  isagain among mankind, and tends the goats on the mountains.\"\\nHe isalways climbing  higher and higher, far away from all others, but notfrom me.\"\\nHe is mine; I will send  for him.\"\\n And she gave Vertigo thecommission.\"\\n It was summer, and the Ice Maiden was melting amidst the greenverdure, when Vertigo  swung himself up and down.\"\\nVertigo has manybrothers, quite a troop of them, and the  Ice Maiden chose thestrongest among them.\"\\nThey exercise their power in different ways,  andeverywhere.\"\\nSome sit on the banisters of steep stairs, others on theouter rails  of lofty towers, or spring like squirrels along the ridgesof the mountains.\"\\nOthers  tread the air as a swimmer treads thewater, and lure their victims here and there  till they fall into thedeep abyss.\"\\nVertigo and the Ice Maiden clutch at human beings,  asthe polypus seizes upon all that comes within its reach.\"\\nAnd nowVertigo was to seize  Rudy.\"\\n \"Seize him, indeed,\" cried Vertigo; \"I cannot do it.\"\\nThatmonster of a cat has taught  him her tricks.\"\\nThat child of the humanrace has a power within him which keeps me  at a distance; I cannotpossibly reach the boy when he hangs from the branches of  trees,over the precipice; or I would gladly tickle his feet, and send himheels over  head through the air; but I cannot accomplish it.\"\\n  \"We must accomplish it,\" said the Ice Maiden; \"either you or Imust; and I will- I  will!\"\\n  \"No, no!\"\\n sounded through the air, like an echo on the mountainchurch bells chime.\"\\n It was an answer in song, in the melting tonesof a chorus from others of nature\\'s  spirits- good and lovingspirits, the daughters of the sunbeam.\"\\nThey who place  themselves ina circle every evening on the mountain peaks; there they spread outtheir  rose-colored wings, which, as the sun sinks, become more flamingred, until the lofty  Alps seem to burn with fire.\"\\nMen call this theAlpine glow.\"\\nAfter the sun has set,  they disappear within the whitesnow on the mountain-tops, and slumber there till  sunrise, when theyagain come forth.\"\\nThey have great love for flowers, for  butterflies,and for mankind; and from among the latter they had chosen littleRudy.\"\\n \"You shall not catch him; you shall not seize him!\"\\n they sang.\"\\n \"Greater and stronger than he have I seized!\"\\n said the Ice Maiden.\"\\n Then the daughters of the sun sang a song of the traveller,whose cloak had been carried  away by the wind.\"\\n\"The wind took thecovering, but not the man; it could even seize  upon him, but nothold him fast.\"\\nThe children of strength are more powerful,  moreethereal, even than we are.\"\\nThey can rise higher than our parent,the sun.\"\\nThey  have the magic words that rule the wind and the waves,and compel them to serve and  obey; and they can, at last, cast off theheavy, oppressive weight of mortality, and  soar upwards.\"\\n Thus sweetlysounded the bell-like tones of the chorus.\"\\n And each morning the sun\\'s rays shone through the one littlewindow of the  grandfather\\'s house upon the quiet child.\"\\nThedaughters of the sunbeam kissed him;  they wished to thaw, and melt,and obliterate the ice kiss which the queenly maiden  of the glaciershad given him as he lay in the lap of his dead mother, in the  deepcrevasse of ice from which he had been so wonderfully rescued.\"\\n II.\"\\nTHE JOURNEY TO THE NEW HOME  Rudy was just eight years old, when his uncle, who lived on theother side of the  mountain, wished to have the boy, as he thought hemight obtain a better education  with him, and learn something more.His grandfather thought the same, so he consented  to let him go.Rudy had many to say farewell to, as well as his grandfather.\"\\nFirst,there  was Ajola, the old dog.\"\\n \"Your father was the postilion, and I was the postilion\\'s dog,\"said Ajola.\"\\n\"We have  often travelled the same journey together; I knewall the dogs and men on this side  of the mountain.\"\\nIt is not myhabit to talk much; but now that we have so little time  to conversetogether, I will say something more than usual.\"\\nI will relate to you astory,  which I have reflected upon for a long time.\"\\nI do notunderstand it, and very likely  you will not, but that is of noconsequence.\"\\nI have, however, learnt from it that in  this world thingsare not equally divided, neither for dogs nor for men.\"\\nAll are notborn  to lie on the lap and to drink milk: I have never been pettedin this way, but I have  seen a little dog seated in the place of agentleman or lady, and travelling inside  a post-chaise.\"\\nThe lady,who was his mistress, or of whom he was master, carried a  bottle ofmilk,of which the little dog now and then drank; she also offered himpieces  of sugar to crunch.\"\\nHe sniffed at them proudly, but would noteat one, so she ate them  herself.\"\\nI was running along the dirty roadby the side of the carriage as hungry as  a dog could be, chewing thecud of my own thoughts, which were rather in confusion.\"\\n But many otherthings seemed in confusion also.\"\\nWhy was not I lying on a lap  andtravelling in a coach?\"\\nI could not tell; yet I knew I could notalter my own condition,  either by barking or growling.\"\\n This was Ajola\\'s farewell speech, and Rudy threw his arms roundthe dog\\'s neck and  kissed his cold nose.\"\\nThen he took the cat in hisarms, but he struggled to get free.\"\\n \"You are getting too strong for me,\" he said; \"but I will notuse my claws against  you.\"\\nClamber away over the mountains; it was Iwho taught you to climb.\"\\nDo not fancy  you are going to fall, and youwill be quite safe.\"\\n Then the cat jumped down and ran  away; he did notwish Rudy to see that there were tears in his eyes.\"\\n The hens were hopping about the floor; one of them had no tail;a traveller, who fancied  himself a sportsman, had shot off her tail,he had mistaken her for a bird of prey.\"\\n \"Rudy is going away over the mountains,\" said one of the hens.\"\\n \"He is always in such a hurry,\" said the other; \"and I don\\'tlike taking leave,\" so  they both hopped out.\"\\n But the goats said farewell; they bleated and wanted to go withhim, they were so very  sorry.\"\\n Just at this time two clever guides were going to cross themountains to the other  side of the Gemmi, and Rudy was to go with themon foot.\"\\nIt was a long walk for such  a little boy, but he had plentyof strength and invincible courage.\"\\nThe swallows flew  with him alittle way, singing, \"We and you- you and we.\"\\n The way led acrossthe rushing  Lutschine, which falls in numerous streams from the darkclefts of the Grindelwald  glaciers.\"\\nTrunks of fallen trees andblocks of stone form bridges over these streams.\"\\n After passing aforest of alders, they began to ascend, passing by some blocks ofice  that had loosened themselves from the side of the mountain and layacross their path;  they had to step over these ice-blocks or walkround them.\"\\nRudy crept here and ran  there, his eyes sparkling withjoy, and he stepped so firmly with his iron-tipped  mountain shoe, thathe left a mark behind him wherever he placed his foot.\"\\n The earth was black where the mountain torrents or the meltedice had poured upon it,  but the bluish green, glassy ice sparkledand glittered.\"\\nThey had to go round little  pools, like lakes, enclosedbetween large masses of ice; and, while thus wandering  out of theirpath, they came near an immense stone, which lay balanced on theedge of  an icy peak.\"\\nThe stone lost its balance just as they reachedit, and rolled over into  the abyss beneath, while the noise of itsfall was echoed back from every hollow cliff  of the glaciers.\"\\n They were always going upwards.\"\\nThe glaciers seemed to spreadabove them like a  continued chain of masses of ice, piled up in wildconfusion between bare and rugged  rocks.\"\\nRudy thought for a momentof what had been told him, that he and his mother  had once lain buriedin one of these cold, heart-chilling fissures; but he soon  banishedsuch thoughts, and looked upon the story as fabulous, like manyother stories  which had been told him.\"\\nOnce or twice, when the menthought the way was rather  difficult for such a little boy, theyheld out their hands to assist him; but he would  not accept theirassistance, for he stood on the slippery ice as firmly as if he hadbeen  a chamois.\"\\nThey came at length to rocky ground; sometimesstepping upon moss-covered  stones, sometimes passing beneath stuntedfir-trees, and again through green meadows.\"\\n The landscape was alwayschanging, but ever above them towered the lofty snow-clad  mountains,whose names not only Rudy but every other child knew- \"TheJungfrau,\" \"The  Monk and the Eiger.\"\\n  Rudy had never been so far away before; he had never trodden onthe wide-spreading  ocean of snow that lay here with its immovablebillows, from which the wind blows off  the snowflake now and then,as it cuts the foam from the waves of the sea.\"\\nThe glaciers  stand hereso close together it might almost be said they are hand-in-hand; andeach  is a crystal palace for the Ice Maiden, whose power and will itis to seize and imprison  the unwary traveller.\"\\n The sun shone warmly, and the snow sparkled as if covered withglittering diamonds.\"\\n Numerous insects, especially butterflies andbees, lay dead in heaps on the snow.\"\\nThey  had ventured too high, orthe wind had carried them here and left them to die of cold.\"\\n Around the Wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud, like a woolbag, and athreatening cloud  too, for as it sunk lower it increased in size,and concealed within was a \"fohn,\"  fearful in its violence should itbreak loose.\"\\nThis journey, with its varied  incidents,- the wild paths,the night passed on the mountain, the steep rocky  precipices, thehollow clefts, in which the rustling waters from time immemorial  hadworn away passages for themselves through blocks of stone,- allthese were firmly  impressed on Rudy\\'s memory.\"\\n In a forsaken stone building, which stood just beyond the seasof snow, they one night  took shelter.\"\\nHere they found some charcoaland pine branches, so that they soon made  a fire.\"\\nThey arrangedcouches to lie on as well as they could, and then the men  seatedthemselves by the fire, took out their pipes, and began to smoke.\"\\nTheyalso  prepared a warm, spiced drink, of which they partook and Rudy wasnot forgotten- he  had his share.\"\\nThen they began to talk of thosemysterious beings with which the land  of the Alps abounds; the hostsof apparitions which come in the night, and carry off  the sleepersthrough the air, to the wonderful floating town of Venice; of the  wildherds-man, who drives the black sheep across the meadows.\"\\nThese flocksare never  seen, yet the tinkle of their little bells has often beenheard, as well as their  unearthly bleating.\"\\nRudy listened eagerly, butwithout fear, for he knew not what fear  meant; and while helistened, he fancied he could hear the roaring of the spectral  herd.It seemed to come nearer and roar louder, till the men heard it alsoand listened  in silence, till, at length, they told Rudy that hemust not dare to sleep.\"\\nIt was  a \"fohn,\" that violent storm-wind whichrushes from the mountain to the valley beneath,  and in its furysnaps asunder the trunks of large trees as if they were but slenderreeds,  and carries the wooden houses from one side of a river to theother as easily as we  could move the pieces on a chess-board.\"\\nAfter anhour had passed, they told Rudy that  it was all over, and he mightgo to sleep; and, fatigued with his long walk, he readily  slept at theword of command.\"\\n Very early the following morning they again set out.\"\\nThe sun onthis day lighted up  for Rudy new mountains, new glaciers, and newsnow-fields.\"\\nThey had entered the Canton  Valais, and foundthemselves on the ridge of the hills which can be seen  fromGrindelwald; but he was still far from his new home.\"\\nThey pointedout to him other  clefts, other meadows, other woods and rocky paths,and other houses.\"\\nStrange men made  their appearance before him, andwhat men!\"\\nThey were misshapen, wretched-looking  creatures, with yellowcomplexions; and on their necks were dark, ugly lumps of  flesh,hanging down like bags.\"\\nThey were called cretins.\"\\nThey draggedthemselves along  painfully, and stared at the strangers with vacanteyes.\"\\nThe women looked more dreadful  than the men.\"\\nPoor Rudy!\"\\nwerethese the sort of people he should see at his new home?\"\\n III.\"\\nTHE UNCLE  Rudy arrived at last at his uncle\\'s house, and was thankful tofind the people like  those he had been accustomed to see.\"\\nThere wasonly one cretin amongst them, a poor  idiot boy, one of thoseunfortunate beings who, in their neglected conditions, go from  houseto house, and are received and taken care of in different families,for a month  or two at a time.\"\\n Poor Saperli had just arrived at his uncle\\'s house when Rudy came.The uncle was an  experienced hunter; he also followed the trade of acooper; his wife was a lively little  person, with a face like abird, eyes like those of an eagle, and a long, hairy  throat.Everything was new to Rudy- the fashion of the dress, the manners,  theemployments, and even the language; but the latter his childish earwould soon learn.\"\\n He saw also that there was more wealth here, whencompared with his former home at  his grandfather\\'s.\"\\nThe rooms werelarger, the walls were adorned with the horns of  the chamois, andbrightly polished guns.\"\\nOver the door hung a painting of the  VirginMary, fresh alpine roses and a burning lamp stood near it.\"\\nRudy\\'suncle was,  as we have said, one of the most noted chamois hunters inthe whole district, and also  one of the best guides.\"\\nRudy soonbecame the pet of the house; but there was another  pet, an oldhound, blind and lazy, who would never more follow the hunt, well ashe  had once done so.\"\\nBut his former good qualities were not forgotten,and therefore the  animal was kept in the family and treated with everyindulgence.\"\\nRudy stroked the old  hound, but he did not like strangers,and Rudy was as yet a stranger; he did not, however,  long remain so,he soon endeared himself to every heart, and became like one of  thefamily.\"\\n \"We are not very badly off, here in the canton Valais,\" said hisuncle one day; \"we  have the chamois, they do not die so fast as thewild goats, and it is certainly much  better here now than in formertimes.\"\\nHow highly the old times have been spoken of,  but ours isbetter.\"\\nThe bag has been opened, and a current of air now blowsthrough  our once confined valley.\"\\nSomething better always makes itsappearance when old,  worn-out things fail.\"\\n  When his uncle became communicative, he would relate stories ofhis youthful days,  and farther back still of the warlike times inwhich his father had lived.\"\\nValais was  then, as he expressed it,only a closed-up bag, quite full of sick people, miserable  cretins;but the French soldiers came, and they were capital doctors, they soonkilled  the disease and the sick people, too.\"\\nThe French people knewhow to fight in more ways  than one, and the girls knew how toconquer too; and when he said this the uncle nodded  at his wife, whowas a French woman by birth, and laughed.\"\\nThe French could also  dobattle on the stones.\"\\n\"It was they who cut a road out of the solidrock over the  Simplon- such a road, that I need only say to a child ofthree years old, \\'Go down  to Italy, you have only to keep in thehigh road,\\' and the child will soon arrive in  Italy, if he followed mydirections.\"\\n  Then the uncle sang a French song, and cried, \"Hurrah!\"\\nlong liveNapoleon Buonaparte.\"\\n  This was the first time Rudy had ever heard ofFrance, or of Lyons, that great city  on the Rhone where his unclehad once lived.\"\\nHis uncle said that Rudy, in a very few  years, wouldbecome a clever hunter, he had quite a talent for it; he taught theboy  to hold a gun properly, and to load and fire it.\"\\nIn the huntingseason he took him  to the hills, and made him drink the warm bloodof the chamois, which is said to prevent  the hunter from becominggiddy; he taught him to know the time when, from the  differentmountains, the avalanche is likely to fall, namely, at noontide orin the  evening, from the effects of the sun\\'s rays; he made himobserve the movements of the  chamois when he gave a leap, so that hemight fall firmly and lightly on his feet.\"\\n He told him that when onthe fissures of the rocks he could find no place for his feet,  he mustsupport himself on his elbows, and cling with his legs, and evenlean firmly  with his back, for this could be done when necessary.\"\\nHetold him also that the chamois  are very cunning, they placelookers-out on the watch; but the hunter must be more  cunning thanthey are, and find them out by the scent.\"\\n One day, when Rudy went out hunting with his uncle, he hung a coatand hat on an alpine  staff, and the chamois mistook it for a man, asthey generally do.\"\\nThe mountain path  was narrow here; indeed it wasscarcely a path at all, only a kind of shelf, close  to the yawningabyss.\"\\nThe snow that lay upon it was partially thawed, and thestones  crumbled beneath the feet.\"\\nEvery fragment of stone broken offstruck the sides of the  rock in its fall, till it rolled into thedepths beneath, and sunk to rest.\"\\nUpon this  shelf Rudy\\'s uncle laidhimself down, and crept forward.\"\\nAt about a hundred paces  behind himstood Rudy, upon the highest point of the rock, watching a greatvulture  hovering in the air; with a single stroke of his wing the birdmight easily cast the  creeping hunter into the abyss beneath, and makehim his prey.\"\\nRudy\\'s uncle had eyes  for nothing but the chamois,who, with its young kid, had just appeared round the edge  of the rock.So Rudy kept his eyes fixed on the bird, he knew well what the greatcreature  wanted; therefore he stood in readiness to discharge hisgun at the proper moment.\"\\n Suddenly the chamois made a spring, andhis uncle fired and struck the animal with  the deadly bullet; whilethe young kid rushed away, as if for a long life he had  beenaccustomed to danger and practised flight.\"\\nThe large bird, alarmedat the report  of the gun, wheeled off in another direction, and Rudy\\'suncle was saved from danger,  of which he knew nothing till he was toldof it by the boy.\"\\n While they were both in pleasant mood, wending their wayhomewards, and the uncle  whistling the tune of a song he had learnt inhis young days, they suddenly heard a  peculiar sound which seemed tocome from the top of the mountain.\"\\nThey looked up, and  saw above them,on the over-hanging rock, the snow-covering heave and lift itself as  apiece of linen stretched on the ground to dry raises itself when thewind creeps under  it.\"\\nSmooth as polished marble slabs, the waves ofsnow cracked and loosened themselves,  and then suddenly, with therumbling noise of distant thunder, fell like a foaming  cataract intothe abyss.\"\\nAn avalanche had fallen, not upon Rudy and his uncle, butvery  near them.\"\\nAlas, a great deal too near!\"\\n \"Hold fast, Rudy!\"\\n cried his uncle; \"hold fast, with all yourmight.\"\\n  Then Rudy clung with his arms to the trunk of the nearest tree,while his uncle climbed  above him, and held fast by the branches.The avalanche rolled past them at some  distance; but the gust ofwind that followed, like the storm-wings of the avalanche,  snappedasunder the trees and bushes over which it swept, as if they hadbeen but dry  rushes, and threw them about in every direction.\"\\nThe treeto which Rudy clung was thus  overthrown, and Rudy dashed to theground.\"\\nThe higher branches were snapped off, and  carried away to agreat distance; and among these shattered branches lay Rudy\\'s  uncle,with his skull fractured.\"\\nWhen they found him, his hand was stillwarm; but it  would have been impossible to recognize his face.\"\\nRudystood by, pale and trembling;  it was the first shock of his life,the first time he had ever felt fear.\"\\nLate in the  evening hereturned home with the fatal news,- to that home which was now to beso full  of sorrow.\"\\nHis uncle\\'s wife uttered not a word, nor shed atear, till the corpse was  brought in; then her agony burst forth.The poor cretin crept away to his bed, and  nothing was seen of himduring the whole of the following day.\"\\nTowards evening, however,  hecame to Rudy, and said, \"Will you write a letter for me?\"\\nSaperlicannot write; Saperli  can only take the letters to the post.\"\\n  \"A letter for you!\"\\n said Rudy; \"who do you wish to write to?\"\\n  \"To the Lord Christ,\" he replied.\"\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n asked Rudy.\"\\n Then the poor idiot, as the cretin was often called, looked atRudy with a most touching  expression in his eyes, clasped his hands,and said, solemnly and devoutly, \"Saperli  wants to send a letter toJesus Christ, to pray Him to let Saperli die, and not the  master ofthe house here.\"\\n  Rudy pressed his hand, and replied, \"A letter would not reachHim up above; it would  not give him back whom we have lost.\"\\n  It was not, however, easy for Rudy to convince Saperli of theimpossibility of doing  what he wished.\"\\n \"Now you must work for us,\" said his foster-mother; and Rudyvery soon became the entire  support of the house.BABETTE  IV.\"\\nBABETTE  Who was the best marksman in the canton Valais?\"\\nThe chamois knewwell.\"\\n\"Save yourselves  from Rudy,\" they might well say.\"\\nAnd who is thehandsomest marksman?\"\\n\"Oh, it is Rudy,\"  said the maidens; but theydid not say, \"Save yourselves from Rudy.\"\\n Neither did  anxiousmothers say so; for he bowed to them as pleasantly as to the younggirls.\"\\nHe  was so brave and cheerful.\"\\nHis cheeks were brown, histeeth white, and his eyes dark  and sparkling.\"\\nHe was now a handsomeyoung man of twenty years.\"\\nThe most icy water  could not deter him fromswimming; he could twist and turn like a fish.\"\\nNone could  climb likehe, and he clung as firmly to the edges of the rocks as a limpet.\"\\nHehad  strong muscular power, as could be seen when he leapt from rock torock.\"\\nHe had learnt  this first from the cat, and more lately fromthe chamois.\"\\nRudy was considered the  best guide over the mountains;every one had great confidence in him.\"\\nHe might have  made a great dealof money as guide.\"\\nHis uncle had also taught him the trade of acooper;  but he had no inclination for either; his delight was inchamois-hunting, which also  brought him plenty of money.\"\\nRudy would bea very good match, as people said, if he  would not look above hisown station.\"\\nHe was also such a famous partner in dancing,  that thegirls often dreamt about him, and one and another thought of himeven when  awake.\"\\n \"He kissed me in the dance,\" said Annette, the schoolmaster\\'sdaughter, to her dearest  friend; but she ought not to have toldthis, even to her dearest friend.\"\\nIt is not  easy to keep such secrets;they are like sand in a sieve; they slip out.\"\\nIt was therefore  soonknown that Rudy, so brave and so good as he was, had kissed some onewhile dancing,  and yet he had never kissed her who was dearest to him.\"\\n \"Ah, ah,\" said an old hunter, \"he has kissed Annette, has he?\"\\nhehas begun with A,  and I suppose he will kiss through the wholealphabet.\"\\n  But a kiss in the dance was all the busy tongues could accusehim of.\"\\nHe certainly  had kissed Annette, but she was not the flower ofhis heart.\"\\n Down in the valley, near Bex, among the great walnut-trees, by theside of a little  rushing mountain-stream, lived a rich miller.\"\\nHisdwelling-house was a large building,  three storeys high, with littleturrets.\"\\nThe roof was covered with chips, bound  together with tinplates, that glittered in sunshine and in the moonlight.\"\\nThe  largestof the turrets had a weather-cock, representing an apple pierced bya  glittering arrow, in memory of William Tell.\"\\nThe mill was a neat andwell-ordered place,  that allowed itself to be sketched and writtenabout; but the miller\\'s daughter did  not permit any to sketch or writeabout her.\"\\nSo, at least, Rudy would have said, for  her image waspictured in his heart; her eyes shone in it so brightly, that quitea  flame had been kindled there; and, like all other fires, it hadburst forth so suddenly,  that the miller\\'s daughter, the beautifulBabette, was quite unaware of it.\"\\nRudy had  never spoken a word toher on the subject.\"\\nThe miller was rich, and, on that account,  Babettestood very high, and was rather difficult to aspire to.\"\\nBut saidRudy to himself,  \"Nothing is too high for a man to reach: he mustclimb with confidence in himself,  and he will not fail.\"\\n He had learntthis lesson in his youthful home.\"\\n It happened once that Rudy had some business to settle at Bex.It was a long journey  at that time, for the railway had not beenopened.\"\\nFrom the glaciers of the Rhone,  at the foot of the Simplon,between its ever-changing mountain summits, stretches the  valley ofthe canton Valais.\"\\nThrough it runs the noble river of the Rhone, whichoften  overflows its banks, covering fields and highways, anddestroying everything in its  course.\"\\nNear the towns of Sion and St.Maurice, the valley takes a turn, and bends  like an elbow, andbehind St.\"\\nMaurice becomes so narrow that there is only space  enoughfor the bed of the river and a narrow carriage-road.\"\\nAn old towerstands here,  as if it were guardian to the canton Valais, which endsat this point; and from it  we can look across the stone bridge tothe toll-house on the other side, where the  canton Vaud commences.\"\\nNotfar from this spot stands the town of Bex, and at every  step can beseen an increase of fruitfulness and verdure.\"\\nIt is like entering agrove  of chestnut and walnut-trees.\"\\nHere and there the cypress andpomegranate blossoms peep  forth; and it is almost as warm as anItalian climate.\"\\nRudy arrived at Bex, and soon  finished the businesswhich had brought him there, and then walked about the town;  but noteven the miller\\'s boy could be seen, nor any one belonging to themill, not  to mention Babette.\"\\nThis did not please him at all.Evening came on.\"\\nThe air was filled  with the perfume of the wild thymeand the blossoms of the lime-trees, and the green  woods on themountains seemed to be covered with a shining veil, blue as the sky.Over  everything reigned a stillness, not of sleep or of death, butas if Nature were holding  her breath, that her image might bephotographed on the blue vault of heaven.\"\\nHere  and there, amidst thetrees of the silent valley, stood poles which supported the wires  ofthe electric telegraph.\"\\nAgainst one of these poles leaned an object somotionless  that it might have been mistaken for the trunk of a tree;but it was Rudy, standing  there as still as at that moment waseverything around him.\"\\nHe was not asleep, neither  was he dead; butjust as the various events in the world- matters of  momentousimportance to individuals- were flying through the telegraph wires,without  the quiver of a wire or the slightest tone, so, through themind of Rudy, thoughts  of overwhelming importance were passing,without an outward sign of emotion.\"\\nThe  happiness of his future lifedepended upon the decision of his present reflections.\"\\n His eyes werefixed on one spot in the distance- a light that twinkled through  thefoliage from the parlor of the miller\\'s house, where Babette dwelt.Rudy stood so  still, that it might have been supposed he waswatching for a chamois; but he was in  reality like a chamois, who willstand for a moment, looking as if it were chiselled  out of the rock,and then, if only a stone rolled by, would suddenly bound forward  witha spring, far away from the hunter.\"\\nAnd so with Rudy: a sudden roll ofhis thoughts  roused him from his stillness, and made him bound forwardwith determination to act.\"\\n \"Never despair!\"\\n cried he.\"\\n\"A visit to the mill, to say goodevening to the miller,  and good evening to little Babette, can do noharm.\"\\nNo one ever fails who has confidence  in himself.\"\\nIf I am to beBabette\\'s husband, I must see her some time or other.\"\\n  Then Rudy laughed joyously, and took courage to go to the mill.\"\\nHeknew what he wanted;  he wanted to marry Babette.\"\\nThe clear water ofthe river rolled over its yellow bed,  and willows and lime-treeswere reflected in it, as Rudy stepped along the path to  the miller\\'shouse.\"\\nBut, as the children sing-  \"There was no one at home in the house,  Only a kitten at play.\"\\n  The cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried \"mew.\"\\n ButRudy had no  inclination for this sort of conversation; he passed on,and knocked at the door.\"\\nNo  one heard him, no one opened the door.\"\\nMew,\" said the cat again; and had Rudy been  still a child, he wouldhave understood this language, and known that the cat wished  to tellhim there was no one at home.\"\\nSo he was obliged to go to the milland make  inquiries, and there he heard that the miller had gone on ajourney to Interlachen,  and taken Babette with him, to the greatshooting festival, which began that morning,  and would continue foreight days, and that people from all the German settlements  would bethere.\"\\n Poor Rudy!\"\\nwe may well say.\"\\nIt was not a fortunate day for hisvisit to Bex.\"\\nHe had  just to return the way he came, through St.Maurice and Sion, to his home in the valley.\"\\n But he did not despair.When the sun rose the next morning, his good spirits had  returned;indeed he had never really lost them.\"\\n\"Babette is at Interlachen,\"said Rudy  to himself, \"many days\\' journey from here.\"\\nIt is certainly along way for any one who  takes the high-road, but not so far if hetakes a short cut across the mountain, and  that just suits achamois-hunter.\"\\nI have been that way before, for it leads to thehome  of my childhood, where, as a little boy, I lived with mygrandfather.\"\\nAnd there are  shooting matches at Interlachen.\"\\nI will go,and try to stand first in the match.\"\\nBabette  will be there, and Ishall be able to make her acquaintance.\"\\n  Carrying his light knapsack, which contained his Sunday clothes,on his back, and with  his musket and his game-bag over his shoulder,Rudy started to take the shortest way  across the mountain.\"\\nStill itwas a great distance.\"\\nThe shooting matches were to  commence on thatday, and to continue for a whole week.\"\\nHe had been told also thatthe  miller and Babette would remain that time with some relatives atInterlachen.\"\\nSo over  the Gemmi Rudy climbed bravely, and determined todescend the side of the Grindelwald.\"\\n Bright and joyous were hisfeelings as he stepped lightly onwards, inhaling the  invigoratingmountain air.\"\\nThe valley sunk as he ascended, the circle of thehorizon  expanded.\"\\nOne snow-capped peak after another rose beforehim, till the whole of the  glittering Alpine range became visible.Rudy knew each ice-clad peak, and he continued  his course towardsthe Schreckhorn, with its white powdered stone finger raised high  inthe air.\"\\nAt length he had crossed the highest ridges, and before himlay the green  pasture lands sloping down towards the valley, which wasonce his home.\"\\nThe buoyancy  of the air made his heart light.\"\\nHilland valley were blooming in luxuriant beauty,  and his thoughts wereyouthful dreams, in which old age or death were out of the  question.Life, power, and enjoyment were in the future, and he felt free andlight  as a bird.\"\\nAnd the swallows flew round him, as in the days ofhis childhood, singing  \"We and you- you and we.\"\\n All was overflowingwith joy.\"\\nBeneath him lay the meadows,  covered with velvety green,with the murmuring river flowing through them, and dotted  here andthere were small wooden houses.\"\\nHe could see the edges of theglaciers, looking  like green glass against the soiled snow, and thedeep chasms beneath the loftiest  glacier.\"\\nThe church bells wereringing, as if to welcome him to his home with their  sweet tones.His heart beat quickly, and for a moment he seemed to haveforegotten  Babette, so full were his thoughts of old recollections.\"\\nHewas, in imagination, once  more wandering on the road where, when alittle boy, he, with other children, came  to sell their curiouslycarved toy houses.\"\\nYonder, behind the fir-trees, still stood  hisgrandfather\\'s house, his mother\\'s father, but strangers dwelt in itnow.\"\\nChildren  came running to him, as he had once done, and wishedto sell their wares.\"\\nOne of them  offered him an Alpine rose.\"\\nRudy tookthe rose as a good omen, and thought of Babette.\"\\n He quickly crossedthe bridge where the two rivers flow into each other.\"\\nHere he founda  walk over-shadowed with large walnut-trees, and their thickfoliage formed a pleasant  shade.\"\\nVery soon he perceived in thedistance, waving flags, on which glittered a white  cross on a redground- the standard of the Danes as well as of the Swiss- andbefore  him lay Interlachen.\"\\n \"It is really a splendid town, like none other that I have everseen,\" said Rudy to  himself.\"\\nIt was indeed a Swiss town in its holidaydress.\"\\nNot like the many other towns,  crowded with heavy stone houses,stiff and foreign looking.\"\\nNo; here it seemed as if  the woodenhouses on the hills had run into the valley, and placed themselvesin rows  and ranks by the side of the clear river, which rushes like anarrow in its course.\"\\n The streets were rather irregular, it is true,but still this added to their  picturesque appearance.\"\\nThere was onestreet which Rudy thought the prettiest of them  all; it had been builtsince he had visited the town when a little boy.\"\\nIt seemed to  him asif all the neatest and most curiously carved toy houses which hisgrandfather  once kept in the large cupboard at home, had beenbrought out and placed in this spot,  and that they had increased insize since then, as the old chestnut trees had done.\"\\n The houses werecalled hotels; the woodwork on the windows and balconies was  curiouslycarved.\"\\nThe roofs were gayly painted, and before each house was aflower  garden, which separated it from the macadamized high-road.These houses all stood on  the same side of the road, so that thefresh, green meadows, in which were cows grazing,  with bells ontheir necks, were not hidden.\"\\nThe sound of these bells is oftenheard  amidst Alpine scenery.\"\\nThese meadows were encircled by loftyhills, which receded a  little in the centre, so that the mostbeautifully formed of Swiss mountains- the  snow-crowned Jungfrau-could be distinctly seen glittering in the distance.\"\\nA number  ofelegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies from foreign lands, andcrowds of country  people from the neighboring cantons, wereassembled in the town.\"\\nEach marksman wore  the number of hits he hadmade twisted in a garland round his hat.\"\\nHere were music  and singingof all descriptions: hand-organs, trumpets, shouting, and noise.\"\\n Thehouses and bridges were adorned with verses and inscriptions.\"\\nFlagsand banners  were waving.\"\\nShot after shot was fired, which was the bestmusic to Rudy\\'s ears.\"\\nAnd  amidst all this excitement he quite forgotBabette, on whose account only he had come.\"\\n The shooters werethronging round the target, and Rudy was soon amongst them.\"\\nBut  whenhe took his turn to fire, he proved himself the best shot, for healways struck  the bull\\'s-eye.\"\\n \"Who may that young stranger be?\"\\n was the inquiry on all sides.\"\\nHe speaks French as  it is spoken in the Swiss cantons.\"\\n  \"And makes himself understood very well when he speaks German,\"said some.\"\\n \"He lived here, when a child, with his grandfather, in a houseon the road to  Grindelwald,\" remarked one of the sportsmen.\"\\n And full of life was this young stranger; his eyes sparkled, hisglance was steady,  and his arm sure, therefore he always hit the mark.Good fortune gives courage, and  Rudy was always courageous.\"\\nHe soonhad a circle of friends gathered round him.\"\\nEvery  one noticed him, anddid him homage.\"\\nBabette had quite vanished from his thoughts,  whenhe was struck on the shoulder by a heavy hand, and a deep voice saidto him in  French, \"You are from the canton Valais.\"\\n  Rudy turned round, and beheld a man with a ruddy, pleasant face,and a stout figure.\"\\n It was the rich miller from Bex.\"\\nHis broad, portlyperson, hid the slender, lovely  Babette; but she came forward andglanced at him with her bright, dark eyes.\"\\nThe rich  miller was verymuch flattered at the thought that the young man, who was  acknowledgedto be the best shot, and was so praised by every one, should be fromhis  own canton.\"\\nNow was Rudy really fortunate: he had travelled allthis way to this place,  and those he had forgotten were now come toseek him.\"\\nWhen country people go far from  home, they often meet withthose they know, and improve their acquaintance.\"\\nRudy, by  hisshooting, had gained the first place in the shooting-match, just asthe miller at  home at Bex stood first, because of his money and hismill.\"\\nSo the two men shook hands,  which they had never done before.Babette, too, held out her hand to Rudy frankly,  and he pressed itin his, and looked at her so earnestly, that she blushed deeply.\"\\n Themiller talked of the long journey they had travelled, and of themany towns they  had seen.\"\\nIt was his opinion that he had really madeas great a journey as if he had  travelled in a steamship, a railwaycarriage, or a post-chaise.\"\\n \"I came by a much shorter way,\" said Rudy; \"I came over themountains.\"\\nThere is no  road so high that a man may not venture uponit.\"\\n  \"Ah, yes; and break your neck,\" said the miller; \"and you looklike one who will break  his neck some day, you are so daring.\"\\n  \"Oh, nothing ever happens to a man if he has confidence inhimself,\" replied Rudy.\"\\n The miller\\'s relations at Interlachen, with whom the miller andBabette were staying,  invited Rudy to visit them, when they found hecame from the same canton as the miller.\"\\n It was a most pleasant visit.Good fortune seemed to follow him, as it does those who  think andact for themselves, and who remember the proverb, \"Nuts are given tous, but  they are not cracked for us.\"\\n And Rudy was treated by themiller\\'s relations almost  like one of the family, and glasses ofwine were poured out to drink to the welfare  of the best shooter.Babette clinked glasses with Rudy, and he returned thanks for  thetoast.\"\\nIn the evening they all took a delightful walk under thewalnut-trees, in  front of the stately hotels; there were so manypeople, and such crowding, that Rudy  was obliged to offer his arm toBabette.\"\\nThen he told her how happy it made him to  meet people fromthe canton Vaud,- for Vaud and Valais were neighboring cantons.\"\\n Hespoke of this pleasure so heartily that Babette could not resistgiving his arm a  slight squeeze; and so they walked on together, andtalked and chatted like old  acquaintances.\"\\nRudy felt inclined to laughsometimes at the absurd dress and walk of  the foreign ladies; butBabette did not wish to make fun of them, for she knew there  must besome good, excellent people amongst them; she, herself, had agodmother, who  was a high-born English lady.\"\\nEighteen years before,when Babette was christened, this  lady was staying at Bex, and shestood godmother for her, and gave her the valuable  brooch she now worein her bosom.\"\\n Her godmother had twice written to her, and this year she wasexpected to visit  Interlachen with her two daughters; \"but they areold-maids,\" added Babette, who was  only eighteen: \"they are nearlythirty.\"\\n Her sweet little mouth was never still a  moment, and all thatshe said sounded in Rudy\\'s ears as matters of the greatest  importance,and at last he told her what he was longing to tell.\"\\nHow often hehad been  at Bex, how well he knew the mill, and how often he hadseen Babette, when most likely  she had not noticed him; and lastly,that full of many thoughts which he could not  tell her, he had been tothe mill on the evening when she and her father has started  on theirlong journey, but not too far for him to find a way to overtakethem.\"\\nHe told  her all this, and a great deal more; he told her howmuch he could endure for her;  and that it was to see her, and notthe shooting-match, which had brought him to  Interlachen.\"\\nBabettebecame quite silent after hearing all this; it was almost too  much,and it troubled her.\"\\n And while they thus wandered on, the sun sunk behind the loftymountains.\"\\nThe Jungfrau  stood out in brightness and splendor, as aback-ground to the green woods of the  surrounding hills.\"\\nEvery onestood still to look at the beautiful sight, Rudy and  Babette amongthem.\"\\n \"Nothing can be more beautiful than this,\" said Babette.\"\\n \"Nothing!\"\\n replied Rudy, looking at Babette.\"\\n \"To-morrow I must return home,\" remarked Rudy a few minutesafterwards.\"\\n \"Come and visit us at Bex,\" whispered Babette; \"my father willbe pleased to see you.\"\\n  V.\"\\nON THE WAY HOME  Oh, what a number of things Rudy had to carry over themountains, when he set out to  return home!\"\\nHe had three silver cups,two handsome pistols, and a silver coffee-pot.\"\\n This latter would beuseful when he began housekeeping.\"\\nBut all these were not the  heaviestweight he had to bear; something mightier and more important hecarried with  him in his heart, over the high mountains, as hejourneyed homeward.\"\\n The weather was dismally dark, and inclined to rain; the cloudshung low, like a  mourning veil on the tops of the mountains, andshrouded their glittering peaks.\"\\nIn  the woods could be heard the soundof the axe and the heavy fall of the trunks of the  trees, as theyrolled down the slopes of the mountains.\"\\nWhen seen from the heights,the  trunks of these trees looked like slender stems; but on a nearerinspection they were  found to be large and strong enough for the mastsof a ship.\"\\nThe river murmured  monotonously, the wind whistled, and theclouds sailed along hurriedly.\"\\n Suddenly there appeared, close by Rudy\\'s side, a young maiden;he had not noticed her  till she came quite near to him.\"\\nShe was alsogoing to ascend the mountain.\"\\nThe maiden\\'s  eyes shone with anunearthly power, which obliged you to look into them; they  werestrange eyes,- clear, deep, and unfathomable.\"\\n \"Hast thou a lover?\"\\n asked Rudy; all his thoughts were naturallyon love just then.\"\\n \"I have none,\" answered the maiden, with a laugh; it was as if shehad not spoken the  truth.\"\\n \"Do not let us go such a long way round,\" said she.\"\\n\"We mustkeep to the left; it is  much shorter.\"\\n  \"Ah, yes,\" he replied; \"and fall into some crevasse.\"\\nDo youpretend to be a guide,  and not know the road better than that?\"\\n  \"I know every step of the way,\" said she; \"and my thoughts arecollected, while yours  are down in the valley yonder.\"\\nWe shouldthink of the Ice Maiden while we are up here;  men say she is notkind to their race.\"\\n  \"I fear her not,\" said Rudy.\"\\n\"She could not keep me when I was achild; I will not  give myself up to her now I am a man.\"\\n  Darkness came on, the rain fell, and then it began to snow, andthe whiteness dazzled  the eyes.\"\\n \"Give me your hand,\" said the maiden; \"I will help you tomount.\"\\n And he felt the touch  of her icy fingers.\"\\n \"You help me,\" cried Rudy; \"I do not yet require a woman to helpme to climb.\"\\n And  he stepped quickly forwards away from her.\"\\n The drifting snow-shower fell like a veil between them, the windwhistled, and behind  him he could hear the maiden laughing andsinging, and the sound was most strange to  hear.\"\\n \"It certainly must be a spectre or a servant of the Ice Maiden,\"thought Rudy, who  had heard such things talked about when he was alittle boy, and had stayed all night  on the mountain with the guides.\"\\n The snow fell thicker than ever, the clouds lay beneath him; helooked back, there  was no one to be seen, but he heard sounds ofmocking laughter, which were not those  of a human voice.\"\\n When Rudy at length reached the highest part of the mountain,where the path led down  to the valley of the Rhone, the snow hadceased, and in the clear heavens he saw two  bright stars twinkling.They reminded him of Babette and of himself, and of his  futurehappiness, and his heart glowed at the thought.\"\\n VI.\"\\nTHE VISIT TO THE MILL  \"What beautiful things you have brought home!\"\\n said his oldfoster-mother; and her  strange-looking eagle-eyes sparkled, whileshe wriggled and twisted her skinny neck  more quickly and strangelythan ever.\"\\n\"You have brought good luck with you, Rudy.\"\\nI  must give youa kiss, my dear boy.\"\\n  Rudy allowed himself to be kissed; but it could be seen by hiscountenance that he  only endured the infliction as a homely duty.\"\\n \"How handsome you are, Rudy!\"\\n said the old woman.\"\\n \"Don\\'t flatter,\" said Rudy, with a laugh; but still he waspleased.\"\\n \"I must say once more,\" said the old woman, \"that you are verylucky.\"\\n  \"Well, in that I believe you are right,\" said he, as he thought ofBabette.\"\\nNever had  he felt such a longing for that deep valley as henow had.\"\\n\"They must have returned  home by this time,\" said he tohimself, \"it is already two days over the time which  they fixedupon.\"\\nI must go to Bex.\"\\n  So Rudy set out to go to Bex; and when he arrived there, hefound the miller and his  daughter at home.\"\\nThey received him kindly,and brought him many greetings from their  friends at Interlachen.Babette did not say much.\"\\nShe seemed to have become quite  silent;but her eyes spoke, and that was quite enough for Rudy.\"\\nThe miller hadgenerally  a great deal to talk about, and seemed to expect thatevery one should listen to his  jokes, and laugh at them; for was nothe the rich miller?\"\\nBut now he was more inclined  to hear Rudy\\'sadventures while hunting and travelling, and to listen to  hisdescriptions of the difficulties the chamois-hunter has to overcome onthe  mountain-tops, or of the dangerous snow-drifts which the windand weather cause to  cling to the edges of the rocks, or to lie in theform of a frail bridge over the abyss  beneath.\"\\nThe eyes of the braveRudy sparkled as he described the life of a hunter,  or spoke of thecunning of the chamois and their wonderful leaps; also of the  powerfulfohn and the rolling avalanche.\"\\nHe noticed that the more he described,the  more interested the miller became, especially when he spoke of thefierce vulture and  of the royal eagle.\"\\nNot far from Bex, in the cantonValais, was an eagle\\'s nest, more  curiously built under a high,over-hanging rock.\"\\nIn this nest was a young eagle; but  who wouldventure to take it?\"\\nA young Englishman had offered Rudy a wholehandful of  gold, if he would bring him the young eagle alive.\"\\n \"There is a limit to everything,\" was Rudy\\'s reply.\"\\n\"The eaglecould not be taken;  it would be folly to attempt it.\"\\n  The wine was passed round freely, and the conversation kept uppleasantly; but the  evening seemed too short for Rudy, although it wasmidnight when he left the miller\\'s  house, after this his first visit.\"\\n While the lights in the windows of the miller\\'s house stilltwinkled through the green  foliage, out through the open skylight camethe parlor-cat on to the roof, and along  the water-pipe walked thekitchen-cat to meet her.\"\\n \"What is the news at the mill?\"\\n asked the parlor-cat.\"\\n\"Here in thehouse there is secret  love-making going on, which the father knowsnothing about.\"\\nRudy and Babette have been  treading on each other\\'spaws, under the table, all the evening.\"\\nThey trod on my tail  twice,but I did not mew; that would have attracted notice.\"\\n  \"Well, I should have mewed,\" said the kitchen-cat.\"\\n \"What might suit the kitchen would not suit the parlor,\" saidthe other.\"\\n\"I am quite  curious to know what the miller will say whenhe finds out this engagement.\"\\n  Yes, indeed; what would the miller say?\"\\nRudy himself was anxiousto know that; but  to wait till the miller heard of it from otherswas out of the question.\"\\nTherefore,  not many days after this visit, hewas riding in the omnibus that runs between the  two cantons, Valaisand Vaud.\"\\nThese cantons are separated by the Rhone, over which  is abridge that unites them.\"\\nRudy, as usual, had plenty of courage, andindulged in  pleasant thoughts of the favorable answer he shouldreceive that evening.\"\\nAnd when  the omnibus returned, Rudy was againseated in it, going homewards; and at the same  time the parlor-catat the miller\\'s house ran out quickly, crying,-  \"Here, you from the kitchen, what do you think?\"\\nThe miller knowsall now.\"\\nEverything  has come to a delightful end.\"\\nRudy came herethis evening, and he and Babette had much  whispering and secretconversation together.\"\\nThey stood in the path near the  miller\\'sroom.\"\\nI lay at their feet; but they had no eyes or thoughts for me.\"\\n \"\\'I will go to your father at once,\\' said he; \\'it is the mosthonorable way.\\'  \"\\'Shall I go with you?\\' asked Babette; \\'it will give you courage.\\'  \"\\'I have plenty of courage,\\' said Rudy; \\'but if you are with me,he must be friendly,  whether he says Yes or No.\\'  \"So they turned to go in, and Rudy trod heavily on my tail; hecertainly is very clumsy.\"\\n I mewed; but neither he nor Babette hadany ears for me.\"\\nThey opened the door, and  entered together.\"\\nI wasbefore them, and jumped on the back of a chair.\"\\nI hardly know  whatRudy said; but the miller flew into a rage, and threatened to kick himout of the  house.\"\\nHe told him he might go to the mountains, and lookafter the chamois, but not  after our little Babette.\"\\n  \"And what did they say?\"\\nDid they speak?\"\\n asked the kitchen-cat.\"\\n \"What did they say!\"\\nwhy, all that people generally do say whenthey go a-wooing- \\'I  love her, and she loves me; and when there ismilk in the can for one, there is milk  in the can for two.\\'  \"\\'But she is so far above you,\\' said the miller; \\'she has heaps ofgold, as you know.\"\\n You should not attempt to reach her.\\'  \"\\'There is nothing so high that a man cannot reach, if he will,\\'answered Rudy; for  he is a brave youth.\"\\n \"\\'Yet you could not reach the young eagle,\\' said the miller,laughing.\"\\n\\'Babette is  higher than the eagle\\'s nest.\\'  \"\\'I will have them both,\\' said Rudy.\"\\n \"\\'Very well; I will give her to you when you bring me the youngeaglet alive,\\' said  the miller; and he laughed till the tears stood inhis eyes.\"\\n\\'But now I thank you for  this visit, Rudy; and if you cometo-morrow, you will find nobody at home.\"\\nGood-bye,  Rudy.\\'  \"Babette also wished him farewell; but her voice sounded asmournful as the mew of  a little kitten that has lost its mother.\"\\n \"\\'A promise is a promise between man and man,\\' said Rudy.\"\\n\\'Donot weep, Babette; I  shall bring the young eagle.\\'  \"\\'You will break your neck, I hope,\\' said the miller, \\'and weshall be relieved from  your company.\\'  \"I call that kicking him out of the house,\" said the parlor-cat.\"\\nAnd now Rudy is gone,  and Babette sits and weeps, while the millersings German songs that he learnt on his  journey; but I do not troublemyself on the matter,- it would be of no use.\"\\n  \"Yet, for all that, it is a very strange affair,\" said thekitchen-cat.\"\\n VII.\"\\nTHE EAGLE\\'S NEST  From the mountain-path came a joyous sound of some personwhistling, and it betokened  good humor and undaunted courage.\"\\nIt wasRudy, going to meet his friend Vesinaud.\"\\n\"You  must come and help,\"said he.\"\\n\"I want to carry off the young eaglet from the top of  therock.\"\\nWe will take young Ragli with us.\"\\n  \"Had you not better first try to take down the moon?\"\\nThat would bequite as easy a  task,\" said Vesinaud.\"\\n\"You seem to be in goodspirits.\"\\n  \"Yes, indeed I am.\"\\nI am thinking of my wedding.\"\\nBut to be serious,I will tell you  all about it, and how I am situated.\"\\n  Then he explained to Vesinaud and Ragli what he wished to do,and why.\"\\n \"You are a daring fellow,\" said they; \"but it is no use; youwill break your neck.\"\\n  \"No one falls, unless he is afraid,\" said Rudy.\"\\n So at midnight they set out, carrying with them poles, ladders,and ropes.\"\\nThe road  lay amidst brushwood and underwood, over rollingstones, always upwards higher and  higher in the dark night.\"\\nWatersroared beneath them, or fell in cascades from above.\"\\n Humid clouds weredriving through the air as the hunters reached the precipitous  ledgeof the rock.\"\\nIt was even darker here, for the sides of the rocksalmost met, and  the light penetrated only through a small opening atthe top.\"\\nAt a little distance  from the edge could be heard the soundof the roaring, foaming waters in the yawning  abyss beneath them.The three seated themselves on a stone, to await in stillness the  dawnof day, when the parent eagle would fly out, as it would benecessary to shoot  the old bird before they could think of gainingpossession of the young one.\"\\nRudy sat  motionless, as if he had beenpart of the stone on which he sat.\"\\nHe held his gun ready  to fire, withhis eyes fixed steadily on the highest point of the cliff, where  theeagle\\'s nest lay concealed beneath the overhanging rock.\"\\n The three hunters had a long time to wait.\"\\nAt last they heard arustling, whirring  sound above them, and a large hovering objectdarkened the air.\"\\nTwo guns were ready  to aim at the dark body of theeagle as it rose from the nest.\"\\nThen a shot was fired;  for aninstant the bird fluttered its wide-spreading wings, and seemed asif it would  fill up the whole of the chasm, and drag down thehunters in its fall.\"\\nBut it was not  so; the eagle sunk graduallyinto the abyss beneath, and the branches of trees and  bushes werebroken by its weight.\"\\nThen the hunters roused themselves: three of  thelongest ladders were brought and bound together; the topmost ring ofthese ladders  would just reach the edge of the rock which hung overthe abyss, but no farther.\"\\nThe  point beneath which the eagle\\'s nestlay sheltered was much higher, and the sides of  the rock were assmooth as a wall.\"\\nAfter consulting together, they determined to  bindtogether two more ladders, and to hoist them over the cavity, and soform a  communication with the three beneath them, by binding the upperones to the lower.\"\\n With great difficulty they contrived to drag thetwo ladders over the rock, and there  they hung for some moments,swaying over the abyss; but no sooner had they fastened  them together,than Rudy placed his foot on the lowest step.\"\\n It was a bitterly cold morning; clouds of mist were rising frombeneath, and Rudy stood  on the lower step of the ladder as a fly restson a piece of swinging straw, which  a bird may have dropped from theedge of the nest it was building on some tall factory  chimney; but thefly could fly away if the straw were shaken, Rudy could only break  hisneck.\"\\nThe wind whistled around him, and beneath him the waters ofthe abyss, swelled  by the thawing of the glaciers, those palaces ofthe Ice Maiden, foamed and roared  in their rapid course.\"\\nWhen Rudybegan to ascend, the ladder trembled like the web  of the spider,when it draws out the long, delicate threads; but as soon as hereached  the fourth of the ladders, which had been bound together, hefelt more confidence,-  he knew that they had been fastened securely byskilful hands.\"\\nThe fifth ladder, that  appeared to reach the nest,was supported by the sides of the rock, yet it swung to  and fro, andflapped about like a slender reed, and as if it had been bound byfishing  lines.\"\\nIt seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend it,but Rudy knew how to climb;  he had learnt that from the cat, and hehad no fear.\"\\nHe did not observe Vertigo, who  stood in the air behindhim, trying to lay hold of him with his outstretched polypous  arms.\"\\n When at length he stood on the topmost step of the ladder, hefound that he was still  some distance below the nest, and not evenable to see into it.\"\\nOnly by using his hands  and climbing could hepossibly reach it.\"\\nHe tried the strength of the stunted trees,  and thethick underwood upon which the nest rested, and of which it wasformed, and  finding they would support his weight, he grasped themfirmly, and swung himself up  from the ladder till his head andbreast were above the nest, and then what an  overpowering stenchcame from it, for in it lay the putrid remains of lambs,  chamois,and birds.\"\\nVertigo, although he could not reach him, blew thepoisonous vapor  in his face, to make him giddy and faint; and beneath,in the dark, yawning deep, on  the rushing waters, sat the IceMaiden, with her long, pale, green hair falling around  her, and herdeath-like eyes fixed upon him, like the two barrels of a gun.\"\\n\"I havethee  now,\" she cried.\"\\n In a corner of the eagle\\'s nest sat the young eaglet, a largeand powerful bird, though  still unable to fly.\"\\nRudy fixed his eyesupon it, held on by one hand with all his  strength, and with the otherthrew a noose round the young eagle.\"\\nThe string slipped  to its legs.Rudy tightened it, and thus secured the bird alive.\"\\nThen flingingthe sling  over his shoulder, so that the creature hung a good way downbehind him, he prepared  to descend with the help of a rope, and hisfoot soon touched safely the highest step  of the ladder.\"\\nThen Rudy,remembering his early lesson in climbing, \"Hold fast, and  do notfear,\" descended carefully down the ladders, and at last stoodsafely on the  ground with the young living eaglet, where he wasreceived with loud shouts of joy  and congratulations.\"\\n VIII.\"\\nWHAT FRESH NEWS THE PARLOR-CAT HAD TO TELL  \"There is what you asked for,\" said Rudy, as he entered themiller\\'s house at Bex,  and placed on the floor a large basket.\"\\nHeremoved the lid as he spoke, and a pair  of yellow eyes, encircled by ablack ring, stared forth with a wild, fiery glance,  that seemedready to burn and destroy all that came in its way.\"\\nIts short,strong beak  was open, ready to bite, and on its red throat wereshort feathers, like stubble.\"\\n \"The young eaglet!\"\\n cried the miller.\"\\n Babette screamed, and started back, while her eyes wandered fromRudy to the bird in  astonishment.\"\\n \"You are not to be discouraged by difficulties, I see,\" said themiller.\"\\n \"And you will keep your word,\" replied Rudy.\"\\n\"Each has his owncharacteristic, whether  it is honor or courage.\"\\n  \"But how is it you did not break your neck?\"\\n asked the miller.\"\\n \"Because I held fast,\" answered Rudy; \"and I mean to hold fastto Babette.\"\\n  \"You must get her first,\" said the miller, laughing; and Babettethought this a very  good sign.\"\\n \"We must take the bird out of the basket,\" said she.\"\\n\"It isgetting into a rage; how  its eyes glare.\"\\nHow did you manage to conquerit?\"\\n  Then Rudy had to describe his adventure, and the miller\\'s eyesopened wide as he  listened.\"\\n \"With your courage and your good fortune you might win threewives,\" said the miller.\"\\n \"Oh, thank you,\" cried Rudy.\"\\n \"But you have not won Babette yet,\" said the miller, slappingthe young Alpine hunter  on the shoulder playfully.\"\\n \"Have you heard the fresh news at the mill?\"\\n asked theparlor-cat of the kitchen-cat.\"\\n \"Rudy has brought us the young eagle,and he is to take Babette in exchange.\"\\nThey kissed  each other in thepresence of the old man, which is as good as an engagement.\"\\nHe wasquite  civil about it; drew in his claws, and took his afternoon nap,so that the two were  left to sit and wag their tails as much as theypleased.\"\\nThey have so much to talk  about that it will not befinished till Christmas.\"\\n Neither was it finished till  Christmas.\"\\n The wind whirled the faded, fallen leaves; the snow drifted in thevalleys, as well  as upon the mountains, and the Ice Maiden sat inthe stately palace which, in winter  time, she generally occupied.The perpendicular rocks were covered with slippery ice,  and where insummer the stream from the rocks had left a watery veil, icicles largeand  heavy hung from the trees, while the snow-powdered fir-treeswere decorated with  fantastic garlands of crystal.\"\\nThe Ice Maiden rodeon the howling wind across the deep  valleys, the country, as far asBex, was covered with a carpet of snow, so that the  Ice Maiden couldfollow Rudy, and see him, when he visited the mill; and while in  theroom at the miller\\'s house, where he was accustomed to spend so muchof his time  with Babette.\"\\nThe wedding was to take place in thefollowing summer, and they heard  enough of it, for so many of theirfriends spoke of the matter.\"\\n Then came sunshine to the mill.\"\\nThe beautiful Alpine rosesbloomed, and joyous,  laughing Babette, was like the early spring,which makes all the birds sing of summer  time and bridal days.\"\\n \"How those two do sit and chatter together,\" said theparlor-cat; \"I have had enough  of their mewing.\"\\n  IX.\"\\nTHE ICE MAIDEN  The walnut and chestnut trees, which extend from the bridge of St.Maurice, by the  river Rhone, to the shores of the lake of Geneva, werealready covered with the delicate  green garlands of early spring, justbursting into bloom, while the Rhone rushed wildly  from its sourceamong the green glaciers which form the ice palace of the IceMaiden.\"\\n She sometimes allows herself to be carried by the keen wind tothe lofty snow-fields,  where she stretches herself in the sunshineon the soft snowy-cushions.\"\\nFrom thence  she throws her far-seeingglance into the deep valley beneath, where human beings are  busilymoving about like ants on a stone in the sun.\"\\n\"Spirits of strength, asthe  children of the sun call you,\" cried the Ice Maiden, \"ye are butworms!\"\\nLet but a  snow-ball roll, and you and your houses and yourtowns are crushed and swept away.\"\\n  And she raised her proud head,and looked around her with eyes that flashed death from  theirglance.\"\\nFrom the valley came a rumbling sound; men were busily at workblasting  the rocks to form tunnels, and laying down roads for therailway.\"\\n\"They are playing  at work underground, like moles,\" said she.\"\\nThey are digging passages beneath the  earth, and the noise is likethe reports of cannons.\"\\nI shall throw down my palaces,  for theclamor is louder than the roar of thunder.\"\\n Then there ascended fromthe valley  a thick vapor, which waved itself in the air like afluttering veil.\"\\nIt rose, as a  plume of feathers, from a steam engine,to which, on the lately-opened railway, a  string of carriages waslinked, carriage to carriage, looking like a winding serpent.\"\\n Thetrain shot past with the speed of an arrow.\"\\n\"They play at beingmasters down there,  those spirits of strength!\"\\n exclaimed the IceMaiden; \"but the powers of nature are  still the rulers.\"\\n And shelaughed and sang till her voice sounded through the valley,  and peoplesaid it was the rolling of an avalanche.\"\\nBut the children of the sunsang  in louder strains in praise of the mind of man, which can spanthe sea as with a yoke,  can level mountains, and fill up valleys.\"\\nItis the power of thought which gives man  the mastery over nature.\"\\n Just at this moment there came across the snow-field, where theIce Maiden sat, a party  of travellers.\"\\nThey had bound themselvesfast to each other, so that they looked like  one large body on theslippery plains of ice encircling the deep abyss.\"\\n \"Worms!\"\\n exclaimed the Ice Maiden.\"\\n\"You, the lords of the powersof nature!\"\\n And she  turned away and looked maliciously at the deepvalley where the railway train was  rushing by.\"\\n\"There they sit,these thoughts!\"\\n she exclaimed.\"\\n\"There they sit in their  power overnature\\'s strength.\"\\nI see them all.\"\\nOne sits proudly apart, like aking;  others sit together in a group; yonder, half of them are asleep;and when the steam  dragon stops, they will get out and go their way.The thoughts go forth into the world,\"  and she laughed.\"\\n \"There goes another avalanche,\" said those in the valley beneath.\"\\n \"It will not reach us,\" said two who sat together behind the steamdragon.\"\\n\"Two hearts  and one beat,\" as people say.\"\\nThey were Rudy andBabette, and the miller was with them.\"\\n \"I am like the luggage,\" saidhe; \"I am here as a necessary appendage.\"\\n  \"There sit those two,\" said the Ice Maiden.\"\\n\"Many a chamois have Icrushed.\"\\nMillions  of Alpine roses have I snapped and broken off; not aroot have I spared.\"\\nI know them  all, and their thoughts, those spiritsof strength!\"\\n and again she laughed.\"\\n \"There rolls another avalanche,\" said those in the valley.\"\\n X.\"\\nTHE GODMOTHER  At Montreux, one of the towns which encircle the northeast part ofthe lake of Geneva,  lived Babette\\'s godmother, the noble English lady,with her daughters and a young  relative.\"\\nThey had only lately arrived,yet the miller had paid them a visit, and  informed them of Babette\\'sengagement to Rudy.\"\\nThe whole story of their meeting at  Interlachen,and his brave adventure with the eaglet, were related to them, andthey  were all very much interested, and as pleased about Rudy andBabette as the miller  himself.\"\\nThe three were invited to come toMontreux; it was but right for Babette to  become acquainted with hergodmother, who wished to see her very much.\"\\nA steam-boat  startedfrom the town of Villeneuve, at one end of the lake of Geneva, andarrived at  Bernex, a little town beyond Montreux, in about half anhour.\"\\nAnd in this boat, the  miller, with his daughter and Rudy, setout to visit her godmother.\"\\nThey passed the  coast which has been socelebrated in song.\"\\nHere, under the walnut-trees, by the deep  bluelake, sat Byron, and wrote his melodious verses about the prisonerconfined in  the gloomy castle of Chillon.\"\\nHere, where Clarens, withits weeping-willows, is  reflected in the clear water, wanderedRousseau, dreaming of Heloise.\"\\nThe river Rhone  glides gently bybeneath the lofty snow-capped hills of Savoy, and not far from  itsmouth lies a little island in the lake, so small that, seen from theshore, it looks  like a ship.\"\\nThe surface of the island is rocky; andabout a hundred years ago, a lady  caused the ground to be covered withearth, in which three acacia-trees were planted,  and the wholeenclosed with stone walls.\"\\nThe acacia-trees now overshadow everypart  of the island.\"\\nBabette was enchanted with the spot; it seemedto her the most beautiful  object in the whole voyage, and shethought how much she should like to land there.\"\\n But the steam-shippassed it by, and did not stop till it reached Bernex.\"\\nThe  littleparty walked slowly from this place to Montreux, passing the sun-litwalls with  which the vineyards of the little mountain town of Montreuxare surrounded, and  peasants\\' houses, overshadowed by fig-trees,with gardens in which grow the laurel  and the cypress.\"\\n Halfway up the hill stood the boarding-house in which Babette\\'sgodmother resided.\"\\n She was received most cordially; her godmotherwas a very friendly woman, with a round,  smiling countenance.\"\\nWhen achild, her head must have resembled one of Raphael\\'s  cherubs; it wasstill an angelic face, with its white locks of silvery hair.\"\\n Thedaughters were tall, elegant, slender maidens.\"\\n The young cousin, whom they had brought with them, was dressedin white from head to  foot; he had golden hair and golden whiskers,large enough to be divided amongst three  gentlemen; and he beganimmediately to pay the greatest attention to Babette.\"\\n Richly bound books, note-paper, and drawings, lay on the largetable.\"\\nThe balcony  window stood open, and from it could be seen thebeautiful wide extended lake, the  water so clear and still, that themountains of Savoy, with their villages, woods,  and snow-crownedpeaks, were clearly reflected in it.\"\\n Rudy, who was usually so lively and brave, did not in the leastfeel himself at home;  he acted as if he were walking on peas, over aslippery floor.\"\\nHow long and wearisome  the time appeared; it waslike being in a treadmill.\"\\nAnd then they went out for a walk,  whichwas very slow and tedious.\"\\nTwo steps forward and one backwards hadRudy to take  to keep pace with the others.\"\\nThey walked down toChillon, and went over the old castle  on the rocky island.\"\\nThey sawthe implements of torture, the deadly dungeons, the rusty  fetters inthe rocky walls, the stone benches for those condemned to death,  thetrap-doors through which the unhappy creatures were hurled upon ironspikes, and  impaled alive.\"\\nThey called looking at all these apleasure.\"\\nIt certainly was the right  place to visit.\"\\nByron\\'s poetryhad made it celebrated in the world.\"\\nRudy could only  feel that itwas a place of execution.\"\\nHe leaned against the stone framework of  thewindow, and gazed down into the deep, blue water, and over to thelittle island  with the three acacias, and wished himself there, awayand free from the whole  chattering party.\"\\nBut Babette was mostunusually lively and good-tempered.\"\\n \"I have been so amused,\" she said.\"\\n The cousin had found her quite perfect.\"\\n \"He is a perfect fop,\" said Rudy; and this was the first time Rudyhad said anything  that did not please Babette.\"\\n The Englishman had made her a present of a little book, inremembrance of their visit  to Chillon.\"\\nIt was Byron\\'s poem, \"ThePrisoner of Chillon,\" translated into French,  so that Babette couldread it.\"\\n \"The book may be very good,\" said Rudy; \"but that finely combedfellow who gave it  to you is not worth much.\"\\n  \"He looks something like a flour-sack without any flour,\" said themiller, laughing  at his own wit.\"\\nRudy laughed, too, for so had heappeared to him.\"\\n XI.\"\\nTHE COUSIN  When Rudy went a few days after to pay a visit to the mill, hefound the young Englishman  there.\"\\nBabette was just thinking ofpreparing some trout to set before him.\"\\nShe  understood well how togarnish the dish with parsley, and make it look quite tempting.\"\\n Rudythought all this quite unnecessary.\"\\nWhat did the Englishman wantthere?\"\\nWhat was  he about?\"\\nWhy should he be entertained, and waitedupon by Babette?\"\\nRudy was jealous,  and that made Babette happy.\"\\nItamused her to discover all the feelings of his heart;  the strongpoints and weak ones.\"\\nLove was to her as yet only a pastime, and sheplayed  with Rudy\\'s whole heart.\"\\nAt the same time it must beacknowledged that her fortune,  her whole life, her inmost thoughts,her best and most noble feelings in this world  were all for him.\"\\nStillthe more gloomy he looked, the more her eyes laughed.\"\\nShe could  almosthave kissed the fair Englishman, with the golden whiskers, if by sodoing she  could have put Rudy in a rage, and made him run out of thehouse.\"\\nThat would have proved  how much he loved her.\"\\nAll this wasnot right in Babette, but she was only nineteen  years of age, andshe did not reflect on what she did, neither did she think that  herconduct would appear to the young Englishman as light, and not evenbecoming the  modest and much-loved daughter of the miller.\"\\n The mill at Bex stood in the highway, which passed under thesnow-clad mountains, and  not far from a rapid mountain-stream, whosewaters seemed to have been lashed into  a foam like soap-suds.\"\\nThisstream, however, did not pass near enough to the mill,  and thereforethe mill-wheel was turned by a smaller stream which tumbled down therocks  on the opposite side, where it was opposed by a stonemill-dam, and obtained greater  strength and speed, till it fell into alarge basin, and from thence through a channel  to the mill-wheel.\"\\nThischannel sometimes overflowed, and made the path so slippery  that anyone passing that way might easily fall in, and be carried towardsthe mill  wheel with frightful rapidity.\"\\nSuch a catastrophe nearlyhappened to the young  Englishman.\"\\nHe had dressed himself in whiteclothes, like a miller\\'s man, and was  climbing the path to themiller\\'s house, but he had never been taught to climb, and  thereforeslipped, and nearly went in head-foremost.\"\\nHe managed, however, toscramble  out with wet sleeves and bespattered trousers.\"\\nStill, wet andsplashed with mud, he  contrived to reach Babette\\'s window, to which hehad been guided by the light that  shone from it.\"\\nHere he climbed theold linden-tree that stood near it, and began to  imitate the voiceof an owl, the only bird he could venture to mimic.\"\\nBabette heardthe  noise, and glanced through the thin window curtain; but when shesaw the man in white,  and guessed who he was, her little heart beatwith terror as well as anger.\"\\nShe quickly  put out the light, felt ifthe fastening of the window was secure, and then left him  to howl aslong as he liked.\"\\nHow dreadful it would be, thought Babette, if Rudywere  here in the house.\"\\nBut Rudy was not in the house.\"\\nNo, it was muchworse, he was outside,  standing just under the linden-tree.\"\\nHe wasspeaking loud, angry words.\"\\nHe could fight,  and there might be murder!Babette opened the window in alarm, and called Rudy\\'s name;  she toldhim to go away, she did not wish him to remain there.\"\\n \"You do not wish me to stay,\" cried he; \"then this is anappointment you expected\\ufffethis good friend whom you prefer to me.Shame on you, Babette!\"\\n  \"You are detestable!\"\\n exclaimed Babette, bursting into tears.\"\\nGo away.\"\\nI hate you.\"\\n  \"I have not deserved this,\" said Rudy, as he turned away, hischeeks burning, and his  heart like fire.\"\\n Babette threw herself on the bed, and wept bitterly.\"\\n\"So much as Iloved thee, Rudy,  and yet thou canst think ill of me.\"\\n  Thus her anger broke forth; it relieved her, however: otherwiseshe would have been  more deeply grieved; but now she could sleepsoundly, as youth only can sleep.\"\\n XII.\"\\nEVIL POWERS  Rudy left Bex, and took his way home along the mountain path.The air was fresh, but  cold; for here amidst the deep snow, the IceMaiden reigned.\"\\nHe was so high up that  the large trees beneath him,with their thick foliage, appeared like garden plants,  and the pinesand bushes even less.\"\\nThe Alpine roses grew near the snow, which layin  detached stripes, and looked like linen laid out to bleach.\"\\nAblue gentian grew in  his path, and he crushed it with the butt endof his gun.\"\\nA little higher up, he espied  two chamois.\"\\nRudy\\'s eyesglistened, and his thoughts flew at once in a different  direction; buthe was not near enough to take a sure aim.\"\\nHe ascended still higher,to  a spot where a few rough blades of grass grew between the blocks ofstone and the chamois  passed quietly on over the snow-fields.\"\\nRudywalked hurriedly, while the clouds of  mist gathered round him.Suddenly he found himself on the brink of a precipitous rock.\"\\n The rainwas falling in torrents.\"\\nHe felt a burning thirst, his head was hot,and his  limbs trembled with cold.\"\\nHe seized his hunting-flask, butit was empty; he had not  thought of filling it before ascending themountain.\"\\nHe had never been ill in his life,  nor ever experienced suchsensations as those he now felt.\"\\nHe was so tired that he  couldscarcely resist lying down at his full length to sleep, although theground was  flooded with the rain.\"\\nYet when he tried to rouse himself alittle, every object around  him danced and trembled before his eyes.\"\\n Suddenly he observed in the doorway of a hut newly built under therock, a young maiden.\"\\n He did not remember having seen this hut before,yet there it stood; and he thought,  at first, that the young maidenwas Annette, the schoolmaster\\'s daughter, whom he had  once kissed inthe dance.\"\\nThe maiden was not Annette; yet it seemed as if he had seenher  somewhere before, perhaps near Grindelwald, on the evening ofhis return home from  Interlachen, after the shooting-match.\"\\n \"How did you come here?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n \"I am at home,\" she replied; \"I am watching my flocks.\"\\n  \"Your flocks!\"\\n he exclaimed; \"where do they find pasture?\"\\nThere isnothing here but  snow and rocks.\"\\n  \"Much you know of what grows here,\" she replied, laughing.\"\\n\"notfar beneath us there  is beautiful pasture-land.\"\\nMy goats go there.\"\\nItend them carefully; I never miss one.\"\\n What is once mine remainsmine.\"\\n  \"You are bold,\" said Rudy.\"\\n \"And so are you,\" she answered.\"\\n \"Have you any milk in the house?\"\\n he asked; \"if so, give me someto drink; my thirst  is intolerable.\"\\n  \"I have something better than milk,\" she replied, \"which I willgive you.\"\\nSome  travellers who were here yesterday with their guideleft behind them a half a flask  of wine, such as you have nevertasted.\"\\nThey will not come back to fetch it, I know,  and I shall notdrink it; so you shall have it.\"\\n  Then the maiden went to fetch the wine, poured some into awooden cup, and offered  it to Rudy.\"\\n \"How good it is!\"\\n said he; \"I have never before tasted suchwarm, invigorating wine.\"\\n  And his eyes sparkled with new life; aglow diffused itself over his frame; it seemed  as if every sorrow,every oppression were banished from his mind, and a fresh, free  naturewere stirring within him.\"\\n\"You are surely Annette, theschoolmaster\\'s  daughter,\" cried he; \"will you give me a kiss?\"\\n  \"Yes, if you will give me that beautiful ring which you wear onyour finger.\"\\n  \"My betrothal ring?\"\\n he replied.\"\\n \"Yes, just so,\" said the maiden, as she poured out some more wine,and held it to his  lips.\"\\nAgain he drank, and a living joy streamedthrough every vein.\"\\n \"The whole world is mine, why therefore should I grieve?\"\\nthought he.\"\\n\"Everything is  created for our enjoyment and happiness.The stream of life is a stream of happiness;  let us flow on with it tojoy and felicity.\"\\n  Rudy gazed on the young maiden; it was Annette, and yet it was notAnnette; still less  did he suppose it was the spectral phantom, whomhe had met near Grindelwald.\"\\nThe maiden  up here on the mountain wasfresh as the new fallen snow, blooming as an Alpine rose,  and asnimble-footed as a young kid.\"\\nStill, she was one of Adam\\'s race,like Rudy.\"\\nHe  flung his arms round the beautiful being, and gazed intoher wonderfully clear eyes,-  only for a moment; but in that momentwords cannot express the effect of his gaze.\"\\n Was it the spirit of lifeor of death that overpowered him?\"\\nWas he rising higher, or  sinkinglower and lower into the deep, deadly abyss?\"\\nHe knew not; but thewalls of ice  shone like blue-green glass; innumerable clefts yawnedaround him, and the water-drops  tinkled like the chiming of churchbells, and shone clearly as pearls in the light  of a pale-blueflame.\"\\nThe Ice Maiden, for she it was, kissed him, and her kiss sent  achill as of ice through his whole frame.\"\\nA cry of agony escaped fromhim; he struggled  to get free, and tottered from her.\"\\nFor a moment allwas dark before his eyes, but  when he opened them again it waslight, and the Alpine maiden had vanished.\"\\nThe powers  of evil hadplayed their game; the sheltering hut was no more to be seen.\"\\nThewater  trickled down the naked sides of the rocks, and snow lay thicklyall around.\"\\nRudy  shivered with cold; he was wet through to the skin;and his ring was gone,- the  betrothal ring that Babette had given him.His gun lay near him in the snow; he took  it up and tried to dischargeit, but it missed fire.\"\\nHeavy clouds lay on the mountain  clefts,like firm masses of snow.\"\\nUpon one of these Vertigo sat, lurking afterhis  powerless prey, and from beneath came a sound as if a piece ofrock had fallen from  the cleft, and was crushing everything that stoodin its way or opposed its course.\"\\n But, at the miller\\'s, Babette sat alone and wept.\"\\nRudy had notbeen to see her for  six days.\"\\nHe who was in the wrong, and who oughtto ask her forgiveness; for did she  not love him with her whole heart?\"\\n XIII.\"\\nAT THE MILL  \"What strange creatures human beings are,\" said the parlor-catto the kitchen-cat;  \"Babette and Rudy have fallen out with each other.She sits and cries, and he thinks  no more about her.\"\\n  \"That does not please me to hear,\" said the kitchen-cat.\"\\n \"Nor me either,\" replied the parlor-cat; \"but I do not take itto heart.\"\\nBabette may  fall in love with the red whiskers, if shelikes, but he has not been here since he  tried to get on the roof.\"\\n  The powers of evil carry on their game both around us and withinus.\"\\nRudy knew this,  and thought a great deal about it.\"\\nWhat was itthat had happened to him on the mountain?\"\\n Was it really a ghostlyapparition, or a fever dream?\"\\nRudy knew nothing of fever, or  any otherailment.\"\\nBut, while he judged Babette, he began to examine his ownconduct.\"\\n He had allowed wild thoughts to chase each other in hisheart, and a fierce tornado  to break loose.\"\\nCould he confess toBabette, indeed, every thought which in the hour  of temptation mighthave led him to wrong doing?\"\\nHe had lost her ring, and that veryloss  had won him back to her.\"\\nCould she expect him to confess?\"\\nHe feltas if his heart would  break while he thought of it, and while somany memories lingered on his mind.\"\\nHe saw  her again, as she oncestood before him, a laughing, spirited child; many loving words,  whichshe had spoken to him out of the fulness of her love, came like aray of sunshine  into his heart, and soon it was all sunshine as hethought of Babette.\"\\nBut she must  also confess she was wrong; thatshe should do.\"\\n He went to the mill- he went to confession.\"\\nIt began with akiss, and ended with Rudy  being considered the offender.\"\\nIt was such agreat fault to doubt Babette\\'s truth\\ufffeit was most abominable of him.Such mistrust, such violence, would cause them both  great unhappiness.This certainly was very true, she knew that; and therefore  Babettepreached him a little sermon, with which she was herself muchamused, and during  the preaching of which she looked quite lovely.\"\\nSheacknowledged, however, that on  one point Rudy was right.\"\\nHergodmother\\'s nephew was a fop: she intended to burn the  book which hehad given her, so that not the slightest thing should remain to remindher  of him.\"\\n \"Well, that quarrel is all over,\" said the kitchen-cat.\"\\n\"Rudy iscome back, and they  are friends again, which they say is thegreatest of all pleasures.\"\\n  \"I heard the rats say one night,\" said the kitchen-cat, \"thatthe greatest pleasure  in the world was to eat tallow candles and tofeast on rancid bacon.\"\\nWhich are we to  believe, the rats or thelovers?\"\\n  \"Neither of them,\" said the parlor-cat; \"it is always the safestplan to believe  nothing you hear.\"\\n  The greatest happiness was coming for Rudy and Babette.\"\\nThehappy day, as it is called,  that is, their wedding-day, was near athand.\"\\nThey were not to be married at the church  at Bex, nor at themiller\\'s house; Babette\\'s godmother wished the nuptials to  besolemnized at Montreux, in the pretty little church in that town.The miller was  very anxious that this arrangement should be agreed to.He alone knew what the  newly-married couple would receive fromBabette\\'s godmother, and he knew also that  it was a wedding presentwell worth a concession.\"\\nThe day was fixed, and they were  to travel asfar as Villeneuve the evening before, to be in time for the steamerwhich  sailed in the morning for Montreux, and the godmother\\'sdaughters were to dress and  adorn the bride.\"\\n \"Here in this house there ought to be a wedding-day kept,\" saidthe parlor-cat, \"or  else I would not give a mew for the whole affair.\"\\n  \"There is going to be great feasting,\" replied the kitchen-cat.\"\\nDucks and pigeons  have been killed, and a whole roebuck hangs onthe wall.\"\\nIt makes me lick my lips when  I think of it.\"\\n  \"To-morrow morning they will begin the journey.\"\\n  Yes, to-morrow!\"\\nAnd this evening, for the last time, Rudy andBabette sat in the  miller\\'s house as an engaged couple.\"\\nOutside, theAlps glowed in the evening sunset,  the evening bells chimed, and thechildren of the sunbeam sang, \"Whatever happens is  best.\"\\n  XIV.\"\\nNIGHT VISIONS  The sun had gone down, and the clouds lay low on the valley of theRhone.\"\\nThe wind  blew from the south across the mountains; it was anAfrican wind, a wind which scattered  the clouds for a moment, and thensuddenly fell.\"\\nThe broken clouds hung in fantastic  forms upon thewood-covered hills by the rapid Rhone.\"\\nThey assumed the shapes  ofantediluvian animals, of eagles hovering in the air, of frogsleaping over a marsh,  and then sunk down upon the rushing stream andappeared to sail upon it, although  floating in the air.\"\\nAn uprootedfir-tree was being carried away by the current, and  marking out itspath by eddying circles on the water.\"\\nVertigo and his sisters  weredancing upon it, and raising these circles on the foaming river.\"\\nThemoon lighted  up the snow on the mountain-tops, shone on the darkwoods, and on the drifting clouds  those fantastic forms which at nightmight be taken for spirits of the powers of nature.\"\\n Themountain-dweller saw them through the panes of his little window.\"\\nTheysailed in  hosts before the Ice Maiden as she came out of her palace ofice.\"\\nThen she seated herself  on the trunk of the fir-tree as on abroken skiff, and the water from the glaciers  carried her down theriver to the open lake.\"\\n \"The wedding guests are coming,\" sounded from air and sea.\"\\nThesewere the sights and  sounds without; within there were visions, forBabette had a wonderful dream.\"\\nShe  dreamt that she had been married toRudy for many years, and that, one day when he  was out chamoishunting, and she alone in their dwelling at home, the young  Englishmanwith the golden whiskers sat with her.\"\\nHis eyes were quite eloquent,and  his words possessed a magic power; he offered her his hand, andshe was obliged to  follow him.\"\\nThey went out of the house andstepped downwards, always downwards, and  it seemed to Babette as ifshe had a weight on her heart which continually grew heavier.\"\\n She feltshe was committing a sin against Rudy, a sin against God.\"\\nSuddenly shefound  herself forsaken, her clothes torn by the thorns, and her hairgray; she looked upwards  in her agony, and there, on the edge of therock, she espied Rudy.\"\\nShe stretched out  her arms to him, but shedid not venture to call him or to pray; and had she called  him, itwould have been useless, for it was not Rudy, only his hunting coatand hat  hanging on an alpenstock, as the hunters sometimes arrangethem to deceive the chamois.\"\\n \"Oh!\"\\n she exclaimed in her agony; \"oh,that I had died on the happiest day of my life,  my wedding-day.\"\\nO myGod, it would have been a mercy and a blessing had Rudy  travelledfar away from me, and I had never known him.\"\\nNone know what willhappen in  the future.\"\\n And then, in ungodly despair, she castherself down into the deep rocky  gulf.\"\\nThe spell was broken; a cryof terror escaped her, and she awoke.\"\\n The dream was over; it had vanished.\"\\nBut she knew she had dreamtsomething frightful  about the young Englishman, yet months hadpassed since she had seen him or even thought  of him.\"\\nWas he stillat Montreux, and should she meet him there on her wedding day?\"\\n Aslight shadow passed over her pretty mouth as she thought of this, andshe knit her  brows; but the smile soon returned to her lip, and joysparkled in her eyes, for this  was the morning of the day on which sheand Rudy were to be married, and the sun was  shining brightly.\"\\nRudywas already in the parlor when she entered it, and they very  soonstarted for Villeneuve.\"\\nBoth of them were overflowing withhappiness, and the  miller was in the best of tempers, laughing andmerry; he was a good, honest soul,  and a kind father.\"\\n \"Now we are masters of the house,\" said the parlor-cat.\"\\n XV.\"\\nTHE CONCLUSION  It was early in the afternoon, and just at dinner-time, when thethree joyous  travellers reached Villeneuve.\"\\nAfter dinner, the millerplaced himself in the  arm-chair, smoked his pipe, and had a littlenap.\"\\nThe bridal pair went arm-in-arm out  through the town and alongthe high road, at the foot of the wood-covered rocks, and  by the deep,blue lake.\"\\n The gray walls, and the heavy clumsy-looking towers of thegloomy castle of Chillon,  were reflected in the clear flood.\"\\nThelittle island, on which grew the three acacias,  lay at a shortdistance, looking like a bouquet rising from the lake.\"\\n\"How delightfulit  must be to live there,\" said Babette, who again felt the greatestwish to visit the  island; and an opportunity offered to gratify herwish at once, for on the shore lay  a boat, and the rope by which itwas moored could be very easily loosened.\"\\nThey saw  no one near, sothey took possession of it without asking permission of any one, andRudy  could row very well.\"\\nThe oars divided the pliant water like thefins of a fish- that  water which, with all its yielding softness, isso strong to bear and to carry, so  mild and smiling when at rest,and yet so terrible in its destroying power.\"\\nA white  streak of foamfollowed in the wake of the boat, which, in a few minutes, carriedthem  both to the little island, where they went on shore; but therewas only just room enough  for two to dance.\"\\nRudy swung Babette roundtwo or three times; and then, hand-in-hand,  they sat down on alittle bench under the drooping acacia-tree, and looked into  eachother\\'s eyes, while everything around them glowed in the rays of thesetting sun.\"\\n The fir-tree forests on the mountains were covered with a purplehue like the heather  bloom; and where the woods terminated, and therocks became prominent, they looked  almost transparent in the richcrimson glow of the evening sky.\"\\nThe surface of the  lake was like abed of pink rose-leaves.\"\\n As the evening advanced, the shadows fell upon the snow-cappedmountains of Savoy  painting them in colors of deep blue, while theirtopmost peaks glowed like red lava;  and for a moment this light wasreflected on the cultivated parts of the mountains,  making them appearas if newly risen from the lap of earth, and giving to  thesnow-crested peak of the Dent du Midi the appearance of the fullmoon as it rises  above the horizon.\"\\n Rudy and Babette felt that they had never seen the Alpine glowin such perfection before.\"\\n \"How very beautiful it is, and whathappiness to be here!\"\\n exclaimed Babette.\"\\n \"Earth has nothing more to bestow upon me,\" said Rudy; \"an eveninglike this is worth  a whole life.\"\\nOften have I realized my goodfortune, but never more than in this moment.\"\\n I feel that if myexistence were to end now, I should still have lived a happy life.What  a glorious world this is; one day ends, and another begins evenmore beautiful than  the last.\"\\nHow infinitely good God is, Babette!\"\\n  \"I have such complete happiness in my heart,\" said she.\"\\n \"Earth has no more to bestow,\" answered Rudy.\"\\nAnd then came thesound of the evening  bells, borne upon the breeze over the mountainsof Switzerland and Savoy, while still,  in the golden splendor of thewest, stood the dark blue mountains of Jura.\"\\n \"God grant you all that is brightest and best!\"\\n exclaimed Babette.\"\\n \"He will,\" said Rudy.\"\\n\"He will to-morrow.\"\\nTo-morrow you will bewholly mine, my own  sweet wife.\"\\n  \"The boat!\"\\n cried Babette, suddenly.\"\\nThe boat in which they wereto return had broken  loose, and was floating away from the island.\"\\n \"I will fetch it back,\" said Rudy; throwing off his coat andboots, he sprang into  the lake, and swam with strong efforts towardsit.\"\\n The dark-blue water, from the glaciers of the mountains, was icycold and very deep.\"\\n Rudy gave but one glance into the water beneath;but in that one glance he saw a gold  ring rolling, glittering, andsparkling before him.\"\\nHis engaged ring came into his  mind; but thiswas larger, and spread into a glittering circle, in which appeared  aclear glacier.\"\\nDeep chasms yawned around it, the water-drops glitteredas if lighted  with blue flame, and tinkled like the chiming ofchurch bells.\"\\nIn one moment he saw  what would require many words todescribe.\"\\nYoung hunters, and young maidens- men and  women who had sunkin the deep chasms of the glaciers- stood before him here inlifelike  forms, with eyes open and smiles on their lips; and farbeneath them could be heard  the chiming of the church bells ofburied villages, where the villagers knelt beneath  the vaultedarches of churches in which ice-blocks formed the organ pipes, and  themountain stream the music.\"\\n On the clear, transparent ground sat the Ice Maiden.\"\\nShe raisedherself towards Rudy,  and kissed his feet; and instantly a cold,deathly chill, like an electric shock,  passed through his limbs.\"\\nIceor fire!\"\\nIt was impossible to tell, the shock was so  instantaneous.\"\\n \"Mine!\"\\nmine!\"\\n sounded around him, and within him; \"I kissed theewhen thou wert a little  child.\"\\nI once kissed thee on the mouth, andnow I have kissed thee from heel to toe;  thou art wholly mine.\"\\n Andthen he disappeared in the clear, blue water.\"\\n All was still.\"\\nThe church bells were silent; the last tone floatedaway with the last  red glimmer on the evening clouds.\"\\n\"Thou art mine,\"sounded from the depths below:  but from the heights above, from theeternal world, also sounded the words, \"Thou art  mine!\"\\n Happy was hethus to pass from life to life, from earth to heaven.\"\\nA chord  wasloosened, and tones of sorrow burst forth.\"\\nThe icy kiss of death hadovercome the  perishable body; it was but the prelude before life\\'sreal drama could begin, the  discord which was quickly lost in harmony.Do you think this a sad story?\"\\nPoor Babette!\"\\n for her it wasunspeakable anguish.\"\\n The boat drifted farther and farther away.\"\\nNo one on theopposite shore knew that the  betrothed pair had gone over to thelittle island.\"\\nThe clouds sunk as the evening drew  on, and it becamedark.\"\\nAlone, in despair, she waited and trembled.\"\\nThe weather  becamefearful; flash after flash lighted up the mountains of Jura, Savoy,and  Switzerland, while peals of thunder, that lasted for many minutes,rolled over her  head.\"\\nThe lightning was so vivid that every singlevine stem could be seen for a moment  as distinctly as in thesunlight at noon-day; and then all was veiled in darkness.\"\\n Itflashed across the lake in winding, zigzag lines, lighting it up onall sides; while  the echoes of the thunder grew louder and stronger.On land, the boats were all  carefully drawn up on the beach, everyliving thing sought shelter, and at length the  rain poured down intorrents.\"\\n \"Where can Rudy and Babette be in this awful weather?\"\\n said themiller.\"\\n Poor Babette sat with her hands clasped, and her head boweddown, dumb with grief;  she had ceased to weep and cry for help.\"\\n \"In the deep water!\"\\n she said to herself; \"far down he lies, as ifbeneath a glacier.\"\\n  Deep in her heart rested the memory of what Rudy had told her ofthe death of his mother,  and of his own recovery, even after he hadbeen taken up as dead from the cleft in  the glacier.\"\\n \"Ah,\" she thought, \"the Ice Maiden has him at last.\"\\n  Suddenly there came a flash of lightning, as dazzling as therays of the sun on the  white snow.\"\\nThe lake rose for a moment like ashining glacier; and before Babette stood  the pallid, glittering,majestic form of the Ice Maiden, and at her feet lay Rudy\\'s  corpse.\"\\n \"Mine!\"\\n she cried, and again all was darkness around the heavingwater.\"\\n \"How cruel,\" murmured Babette; \"why should he die just as theday of happiness drew  near?\"\\nMerciful God, enlighten myunderstanding, shed light upon my heart; for I cannot  comprehend thearrangements of Thy providence, even while I bow to the decree ofThy  almighty wisdom and power.\"\\n And God did enlighten her heart.\"\\n A sudden flash of thought, like a ray of mercy, recalled her dreamof the preceding  night; all was vividly represented before her.\"\\nSheremembered the words and wishes  she had then expressed, that whatwas best for her and for Rudy she might piously submit  to.\"\\n \"Woe is me,\" she said; \"was the germ of sin really in my heart?was my dream a glimpse  into the course of my future life, whose threadmust be violently broken to rescue  me from sin?\"\\nOh, miserable creaturethat I am!\"\\n  Thus she sat lamenting in the dark night, while through the deepstillness the last  words of Rudy seemed to ring in her ears.\"\\n\"Thisearth has nothing more to bestow.\"\\n  Words, uttered in the fulness ofjoy, were again heard amid the depths of sorrow.\"\\n Years have passed since this sad event happened.\"\\nThe shores of thepeaceful lake still  smile in beauty.\"\\nThe vines are full of lusciousgrapes.\"\\nSteamboats, with waving flags,  pass swiftly by.Pleasure-boats, with their swelling sails, skim lightly over  thewatery mirror, like white butterflies.\"\\nThe railway is opened beyondChillon, and  goes far into the deep valley of the Rhone.\"\\nAt everystation strangers alight with  red-bound guide-books in their hands, inwhich they read of every place worth seeing.\"\\n They visit Chillon, andobserve on the lake the little island with the three acacias,  and thenread in their guide-book the story of the bridal pair who, in the year1856,  rowed over to it.\"\\nThey read that the two were missing till thenext morning, when some  people on the shore heard the despairing criesof the bride, and went to her assistance,  and by her were told ofthe bridegroom\\'s fate.\"\\n But the guide-book does not speak of Babette\\'s quiet lifeafterwards with her father,  not at the mill- strangers dwell therenow- but in a pretty house in a row near the  station.\"\\nOn many anevening she sits at her window, and looks out over  thechestnut-trees to the snow-capped mountains on which Rudy once roamed.She looks  at the Alpine glow in the evening sky, which is caused bythe children of the sun  retiring to rest on the mountain-tops; andagain they breathe their song of the  traveller whom the whirlwindcould deprive of his cloak but not of his life.\"\\nThere  is a rosy tinton the mountain snow, and there are rosy gleams in each heart in  whichdwells the thought, \"God permits nothing to happen, which is not thebest for  us.\"\\n But this is not often revealed to all, as it wasrevealed to Babette in her  wonderful dream.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE JEWISH MAIDEN  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN a charity school, among the children, sat a little Jewish girl.She was a good,  intelligent child, and very quick at her lessons;but the Scripture-lesson class she  was not allowed to join, for thiswas a Christian school.\"\\nDuring the hour of this lesson,  the Jewishgirl was allowed to learn her geography, or to work her sum for thenext  day; and when her geography lesson was perfect, the book remainedopen before her,  but she read not another word, for she sat silentlylistening to the words of the  Christian teacher.\"\\nHe soon becameaware that the little one was paying more attention  to what he saidthan most of the other children.\"\\n\"Read your book, Sarah,\" he said toher  gently.\"\\n But again and again he saw her dark, beaming eyes fixed uponhim; and once, when he  asked her a question, she could answer him evenbetter than the other children.\"\\nShe  had not only heard, but understoodhis words, and pondered them in her heart.\"\\nHer father,  a poor buthonest man, had placed his daughter at the school on the conditionsthat  she should not be instructed in the Christian faith.\"\\nBut it mighthave caused confusion,  or raised discontent in the minds of theother children if she had been sent out of  the room, so sheremained; and now it was evident this could not go on.\"\\nThe teacherwent  to her father, and advised him to remove his daughter from theschool, or to allow  her to become a Christian.\"\\n\"I cannot any longer bean idle spectator of those beaming  eyes, which express such a deep andearnest longing for the words of the gospel,\" said  he.\"\\n Then the father burst into tears.\"\\n\"I know very little of the lawof my fathers,\" said  he; \"but Sarah\\'s mother was firm in her belief asa daughter of Israel, and I vowed  to her on her deathbed that ourchild should never be baptized.\"\\nI must keep my vow:  it is to me evenas a covenant with God Himself.\"\\n And so the little Jewish girl leftthe  Christian school.\"\\n Years rolled by.\"\\nIn one of the smallest provincial towns, in ahumble household, lived  a poor maiden of the Jewish faith, as aservant.\"\\nHer hair was black as ebony, her eye  dark as night, yetfull of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the  east.It was Sarah.\"\\nThe expression in the face of the grown-up maiden wasstill the  same as when, a child, she sat on the schoolroom formlistening with thoughtful eyes  to the words of the Christianteacher.\"\\nEvery Sunday there sounded forth from a church  close by thetones of an organ and the singing of the congregation.\"\\nThe Jewish girlheard  them in the house where, industrious and faithful in all things,she performed her  household duties.\"\\n\"Thou shalt keep the Sabbathholy,\" said the voice of the law in  her heart; but her Sabbath was aworking day among the Christians, which was a great  trouble to her.And then as the thought arose in her mind, \"Does God reckon by daysand  hours?\"\\n her conscience felt satisfied on this question, and shefound it a comfort  to her, that on the Christian Sabbath she couldhave an hour for her own prayers  undisturbed.\"\\nThe music and singing ofthe congregation sounded in her ears while at  work in her kitchen,till the place itself became sacred to her.\"\\nThen she would read  in theOld Testament, that treasure and comfort to her people, and it wasindeed the  only Scriptures she could read.\"\\nFaithfully in her inmostthoughts had she kept the  words of her father to her teacher whenshe left the school, and the vow he had made  to her dying motherthat she should never receive Christian baptism.\"\\nThe New  Testamentmust remain to her a sealed book, and yet she knew a great deal of itsteaching,  and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered amongthe recollections of her  childhood.\"\\n One evening she was sitting in a corner of the dining-room,while her master read aloud.\"\\n It was not the gospel he read, but an oldstory-book; therefore she might stay and  listen to him.\"\\nThe storyrelated that a Hungarian knight, who had been taken prisoner  by aTurkish pasha, was most cruelly treated by him.\"\\nHe caused him to beyoked with  his oxen to the plough, and driven with blows from the whiptill the blood flowed,  and he almost sunk with exhaustion and pain.The faithful wife of the knight at home  gave up all her jewels,mortgaged her castle and land, and his friends raised large  sums tomake up the ransom demanded for his release, which was most enormouslyhigh.\"\\n It was collected at last, and the knight released from slaveryand misery.\"\\nSick and  exhausted, he reached home.\"\\n Ere long came another summons to a struggle with the foes ofChristianity.\"\\nThe still  living knight heard the sound; he could endureno more, he had neither peace nor rest.\"\\n He caused himself to be liftedon his war-horse; the color came into his cheeks, and  his strengthreturned to him again as he went forth to battle and to victory.\"\\nThevery  same pasha who had yoked him to the plough, became hisprisoner, and was dragged to  a dungeon in the castle.\"\\nBut an hourhad scarcely passed, when the knight stood before  the captive pasha,and inquired, \"What do you suppose awaiteth thee?\"\\n  \"I know,\" replied the pasha; \"retribution.\"\\n  \"Yes, the retribution of a Christian,\" replied the knight.\"\\n\"Theteaching of Christ,  the Teacher, commands us to forgive our enemies,to love our neighbors; for God is  love.\"\\nDepart in peace: return to thyhome.\"\\nI give thee back to thy loved ones.\"\\nBut  in future be mild andhumane to all who are in trouble.\"\\n  Then the prisoner burst into tears, and exclaimed, \"Oh how could Iimagine such mercy  and forgiveness!\"\\nI expected pain and torment.\"\\nItseemed to me so sure that I took poison,  which I secretly carriedabout me; and in a few hours its effects will destroy me.\"\\n I mustdie!\"\\nNothing can save me!\"\\nBut before I die, explain to me the teachingwhich  is so full of love and mercy, so great and God-like.\"\\nOh, thatI may hear his teaching,  and die a Christian!\"\\n And his prayer wasgranted.\"\\n This was the legend which the master read out of the oldstory-book.\"\\nEvery one in the  house who was present listened, andshared the pleasure; but Sarah, the Jewish girl,  sitting so still in acorner, felt her heart burn with excitement.\"\\nGreat tears came  into hershining dark eyes; and with the same gentle piety with which she hadonce  listened to the gospel while sitting on the form at school, shefelt its grandeur now,  and the tears rolled down her cheeks.\"\\nThenthe last words of her dying mother rose  before her, \"Let not mychild become a Christian;\" and with them sounded in her heart  thewords of the law, \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\"\\n  \"I am not admitted among the Christians,\" she said; \"they mockme as a Jewish girl;  the neighbors\\' boys did so last Sunday when Istood looking in through the open church  door at the candles burningon the altar, and listening to the singing.\"\\nEver since  I sat on theschool-bench I have felt the power of Christianity; a power which,like  a sunbeam, streams into my heart, however closely I may closemy eyes against it.\"\\nBut  I will not grieve thee, my mother, in thygrave.\"\\nI will not be unfaithful to my father\\'s  vow.\"\\nI will not readthe Bible of the Christian.\"\\nI have the God of my fathers, and  in Him Iwill trust.\"\\n  And again years passed by.\"\\nSarah\\'s master died, and his widowfound herself in such  reduced circumstances that she wished to dismissher servant maid; but Sarah refused  to leave the house, and she becamea true support in time of trouble, and kept the  household togetherby working till late at night, with her busy hands, to earn  theirdaily bread.\"\\nNot a relative came forward to assist them, and the widowwas  confined to a sick bed for months and grew weaker from day to day.Sarah worked hard,  but contrived to spare time to amuse her andwatch by the sick bed.\"\\nShe was gentle  and pious, an angel ofblessing in that house of poverty.\"\\n \"My Bible lies on the table yonder,\" said the sick woman one dayto Sarah.\"\\n\"Read me  something from it; the night appears so long, andmy spirit thirsts to hear the word  of God.\"\\n  And Sarah bowed her head.\"\\nShe took the book, and folded her handover the Bible of  the Christians, and at last opened it, and read tothe sick woman.\"\\nTears stood in her  eyes as she read, and they shonewith brightness, for in her heart it was light.\"\\n \"Mother,\" she murmured, \"thy child may not receive Christianbaptism, nor be admitted  into the congregation of Christian people.Thou hast so willed it, and I will respect  thy command.\"\\nWe aretherefore still united here on earth; but in the next world there  willbe a higher union, even with God Himself, who leads and guides Hispeople till  death.\"\\nHe came down from heaven to earth to suffer for us,that we should bring forth  the fruits of repentance.\"\\nI understand itnow.\"\\nI know not how I learnt this truth,  unless it is through the nameof Christ.\"\\n Yet she trembled as she pronounced the holy  name.\"\\nShestruggled against these convictions of the truth of Christianity forsome  days, till one evening while watching her mistress she wassuddenly taken very ill;  her limbs tottered under her, and she sankfainting by the bedside of the sick woman.\"\\n \"Poor Sarah,\" said the neighbors; \"she is overcome with hardwork and night watching.\"\\n  And then they carried her to the hospitalfor the sick poor.\"\\nThere she died; and they  bore her to herresting-place in the earth, but not to the churchyard of theChristians.\"\\n There was no place for the Jewish girl; but they dug agrave for her outside the wall.\"\\n And God\\'s sun, which shines upon thegraves of the churchyard of the Christians, also  throws its beams onthe grave of the Jewish maiden beyond the wall.\"\\nAnd when the psalms  ofthe Christians sound across the churchyard, their echo reaches herlonely  resting-place; and she who sleeps there will be countedworthy at the resurrection,  through the name of Christ the Lord, whosaid to His disciples, \"John baptized you  with water, but I willbaptize you with the Holy Ghost.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE JUMPER  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Skipjack once wanted to seewhich of them could  jump highest; and they invited the whole world,and whoever else would come, to see  the grand sight.\"\\nAnd there thethree famous jumpers were met together in the room.\"\\n \"Yes, I\\'ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest,\" said theKing, \"for it would  be mean to let these people jump for nothing.\"\\n  The Flea stepped out first.\"\\nHe had very pretty manners, andbowed in all directions,  for he had young ladies\\' blood in hisveins, and was accustomed to consort only with  human beings; andthat was of great consequence.\"\\n Then came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but hehad a good figure,  and wore the green uniform that was born withhim.\"\\nThis person, moreover, maintained  that he belonged to a veryold family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly  esteemedthere.\"\\nHe had just come from the field, he said, and had been put intoa card  house three stories high, and all made of picture cards withthe figures turned inwards.\"\\n There were doors and windows in the house,cut in the body of the Queen of Hearts.\"\\n \"I sing so,\" he said, \"that sixteen native crickets who havechirped from their youth  up, and have never yet had a card house oftheir own, would become thinner than they  are with envy if they wereto hear me.\"\\n  Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care toannounce who they were, and  that they considered themselves entitledto marry a Princess.\"\\n The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that hethought all the more; and  directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him hewas ready to assert that the Skipjack was  of good family, and formedfrom the breastbone of an undoubted goose.\"\\nThe old  councillor, who hadreceived three medals for holding his tongue, declared that  theSkipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his boneswhether there  would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that\\'smore than one can always tell from  the breastbone of the man whowrites the almanac.\"\\n \"I shall not say anything more,\" said the old King.\"\\n\"I only goon quietly, and always  think the best.\"\\n  Now they were to take their jump.\"\\nThe Flea sprang so high thatno one could see him;  and then they asserted that he had not jumped atall.\"\\nThat was very mean.\"\\nThe  Grasshopper only sprang half as high, buthe sprang straight into the King\\'s face,  and the King declared thatwas horribly rude.\"\\nThe Skipjack stood a long time  considering; at lastpeople thought that he could not jump at all.\"\\n \"I only hope he\\'s not become unwell,\" said the Yard Dog, andthen he smelt at him again.\"\\n \"Tap!\"\\n he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap ofthe Princess, who  sat on a low golden stool.\"\\n Then the King said, \"The highest leap was taken by him whojumped up to my daughter;  for therein lies the point; but itrequires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack  has shown that hehas a head.\"\\n  And so he had the Princess.\"\\n \"I jumped highest, after all,\" said the Flea.\"\\n\"But it\\'s all thesame.\"\\nLet her have  the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit ofstick.\"\\nI jumped to the highest; but  in this world a body is requiredif one wishes to be seen.\"\\n  And the Flea went into foreign military service, where it issaid he was killed.\"\\n The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought andconsidered how things  happened in the world.\"\\nAnd he too said, \"Body isrequired!\"\\nbody is required!\"\\n And then  he sang his own melancholy song,and from that we have gathered this story, which they  say is not true,though it\\'s in print.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE LAST DREAM OF THE OLD OAK  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from theopen seacoast, stood  a very old oak-tree.\"\\nIt was just three hundredand sixty-five years old, but that long  time was to the tree as thesame number of days might be to us; we wake by day and  sleep by night,and then we have our dreams.\"\\nIt is different with the tree; it isobliged  to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and doesnot get any sleep till winter  comes.\"\\nWinter is its time for rest;its night after the long day of spring, summer,  and autumn.\"\\nOn manya warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day,had  fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy and if,for a moment, one  of the tiny creatures rested on one of his largefresh leaves, the tree would always  say, \"Poor little creature!\"\\nyourwhole life consists only of a single day.\"\\nHow very  short.\"\\nIt must bequite melancholy.\"\\n  \"Melancholy!\"\\nwhat do you mean?\"\\n the little creature would alwaysreply.\"\\n\"Everything  around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, andbeautiful, that it makes me joyous.\"\\n  \"But only for one day, and then it is all over.\"\\n  \"Over!\"\\n repeated the fly; \"what is the meaning of all over?\"\\nAreyou all over too?\"\\n  \"No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days, and myday is whole seasons  long; indeed it is so long that you could neverreckon it out.\"\\n  \"No?\"\\nthen I don\\'t understand you.\"\\nYou may have thousands of mydays, but I have  thousands of moments in which I can be merry andhappy.\"\\nDoes all the beauty of the  world cease when you die?\"\\n  \"No,\" replied the tree; \"it will certainly last much longer,-infinitely longer than  I can even think of.\"\\n\"Well, then,\" said thelittle fly, \"we have the same time to live;  only we reckondifferently.\"\\n And the little creature danced and floated in the  air,rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing inthe balmy breezes,  laden with the fragrance of clover-fields andwild roses, elder-blossoms and  honeysuckle, from the garden hedges,wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent  of all these was sostrong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.\"\\nThe  longand beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, thatwhen the sun  sank low it felt tired of all its happiness andenjoyment.\"\\nIts wings could sustain  it no longer, and gently and slowlyit glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass,  nodded its littlehead as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly.\"\\nThefly  was dead.\"\\n \"Poor little Ephemera!\"\\n said the oak; \"what a terribly shortlife!\"\\n And so, on every  summer day the dance was repeated, the samequestions asked, and the same answers given.\"\\n The same thing wascontinued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them  feltequally merry and equally happy.\"\\n The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noonof summer, and the  evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night drewnigh- winter was coming.\"\\nAlready  the storms were singing, \"Good-night,good-night.\"\\n Here fell a leaf and there fell  a leaf.\"\\n\"We will rock youand lull you.\"\\nGo to sleep, go to sleep.\"\\nWe will sing you  to sleep, andshake you to sleep, and it will do your old twigs good; they will  evencrackle with pleasure.\"\\nSleep sweetly, sleep sweetly, it is  yourthree-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night.\"\\nCorrectly speaking, you are but ayoungster  in the world.\"\\nSleep sweetly, the clouds will drop snowupon you, which will be quite  a cover-lid, warm and sheltering to yourfeet.\"\\nSweet sleep to you, and pleasant  dreams.\"\\n And there stood theoak, stripped of all its leaves, left to rest during the  whole of along winter, and to dream many dreams of events that had happened inits  life, as in the dreams of men.\"\\nThe great tree had once been small;indeed, in its cradle  it had been an acorn.\"\\nAccording to humancomputation, it was now in the fourth century  of its existence.\"\\nIt wasthe largest and best tree in the forest.\"\\nIts summit towered  aboveall the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that itserved as a  landmark to the sailors.\"\\nIt had no idea how many eyeslooked eagerly for it.\"\\nIn its  topmost branches the wood-pigeon builther nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual  vocal performances, andhis well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn,  when theleaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage wouldcome and  rest upon the branches before taking their flight acrossthe sea.\"\\nBut now it was winter,  the tree stood leafless, so that everyone could see how crooked and bent were the  branches that sprang forthfrom the trunk.\"\\nCrows and rooks came by turns and sat on  them, andtalked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult itwas in  winter to obtain food.\"\\n It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed adream.\"\\nThe tree had,  doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festivetime had arrived, and in his dream fancied  he heard the bellsringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him to  bea beautiful summer\\'s day, mild and warm.\"\\nHis mighty summits wascrowned with  spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams playedamong the leaves and branches, and  the air was full of fragrancefrom herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each  other; thesummer flies danced around him, as if the world had been createdmerely for  them to dance and be merry in.\"\\nAll that had happened to thetree during every year  of his life seemed to pass before him, as ina festive procession.\"\\nHe saw the knights  of olden times and nobleladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with  plumeswaving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists.\"\\nThe hunting hornsounded,  and the dogs barked.\"\\nHe saw hostile warriors, in coloreddresses and glittering armor,  with spear and halberd, pitching theirtents, and anon striking them.\"\\nThe watchfires  again blazed, and mensang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree.\"\\nHe saw  loversmeet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve theinitials of  their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk.Once, but long years had intervened  since then, guitars and Eolianharps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers;  now they seemedto hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.\"\\n Thewood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, andthe cuckoo called  out to tell him how many summer days he had yet tolive.\"\\nThen it seemed as if new life  was thrilling through everyfibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the  highestbranches.\"\\nThe tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, whilethrough the  root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life.\"\\nAs hegrew higher and still higher,  with increased strength, his topmostboughs became broader and fuller; and in  proportion to his growth,so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose  a joyouslonging to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, brightsun itself.\"\\n Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds, whichfloated beneath them like  troops of birds of passage, or large whiteswans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight,  as if it possessed eyes tosee.\"\\nThe stars became visible in broad daylight, large  andsparkling, like clear and gentle eyes.\"\\nThey recalled to the memory thewell-known  look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers whohad once met beneath the  branches of the old oak.\"\\nThese were wonderfuland happy moments for the old tree, full  of peace and joy; and yet,amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing  desirethat all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him,might be able  also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all thissplendor, and experience the  same happiness.\"\\nThe grand, majestic oakcould not be quite happy in the midst of his  enjoyment, while allthe rest, both great and small, were not with him.\"\\nAnd this feeling  ofyearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, aswarmly and fervently  as if they had been the fibres of a humanheart.\"\\nThe summit of the tree waved to and  fro, and bent downwardsas if in his silent longing he sought for something.\"\\nThen there  cameto him the fragrance of thyme, followed by the more powerful scentof honeysuckle  and violets; and he fancied he heard the note of thecuckoo.\"\\nAt length his longing  was satisfied.\"\\nUp through the cloudscame the green summits of the forest trees, and  beneath him, the oaksaw them rising, and growing higher and higher.\"\\nBush and herb  shotupward, and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise morequickly.\"\\nThe  birch-tree was the quickest of all.\"\\nLike a lightningflash the slender stem shot  upwards in a zigzag line, the branchesspreading around it like green gauze and banners.\"\\n Every native ofthe wood, even to the brown and feathery rushes, grew with the  rest,while the birds ascended with the melody of song.\"\\nOn a blade of grass,that  fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat agrasshopper, cleaning his wings  with his legs.\"\\nMay beetles hummed, thebees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own  way; the air was filledwith the sounds of song and gladness.\"\\n  \"But where is the little blue flower that grows by the water?\"\\nasked the oak, \"and  the purple bell-flower, and the daisy?\"\\n You seethe oak wanted to have them all with  him.\"\\n \"Here we are, we are here,\" sounded in voice and song.\"\\n \"But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that?\"\\nand thelilies-of-the-valley,  which last year covered the earth with theirbloom?\"\\nand the wild apple-tree with its  lovely blossoms, and all theglory of the wood, which has flourished year after year?\"\\n even what mayhave but now sprouted forth could be with us here.\"\\n  \"We are here, we are here,\" sounded voices higher in the air, asif they had flown  there beforehand.\"\\n \"Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,\" said theoak in a joyful tone.\"\\n \"I have them all here, both great and small; notone has been forgotten.\"\\nCan such  happiness be imagined?\"\\n It seemedalmost impossible.\"\\n \"In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and it ispossible,\" sounded the  reply through the air.\"\\n And the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards, feltthat his roots were  loosening themselves from the earth.\"\\n \"It is right so, it is best,\" said the tree, \"no fetters hold menow.\"\\nI can fly up  to the very highest point in light and glory.\"\\nAndall I love are with me, both small  and great.\"\\nAll- all are here.\"\\n  Such was the dream of the old oak: and while he dreamed, amighty storm came rushing  over land and sea, at the holy Christmastime.\"\\nThe sea rolled in great billows towards  the shore.\"\\nThere was acracking and crushing heard in the tree.\"\\nThe root was torn from  theground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was beingloosened from  the earth.\"\\nHe fell- his three hundred and sixty-fiveyears were passed as the single  day of the Ephemera.\"\\nOn the morning ofChristmas-day, when the sun rose, the storm  had ceased.\"\\nFrom all thechurches sounded the festive bells, and from every hearth,  even of thesmallest hut, rose the smoke into the blue sky, like the smoke fromthe  festive thank-offerings on the Druids\\' altars.\"\\nThe sea graduallybecame calm, and on  board a great ship that had withstood thetempest during the night, all the flags were  displayed, as a tokenof joy and festivity.\"\\n\"The tree is down!\"\\nThe old oak,- our  landmark onthe coast!\"\\n exclaimed the sailors.\"\\n\"It must have fallen in the stormof  last night.\"\\nWho can replace it?\"\\nAlas!\"\\nno one.\"\\n This was a funeraloration over the  old tree; short, but well-meant.\"\\nThere it laystretched on the snow-covered shore,  and over it sounded the notesof a song from the ship- a song of Christmas joy, and  of theredemption of the soul of man, and of eternal life through Christ\\'satoning  blood.\"\\n \"Sing aloud on the happy morn,  All is fulfilled, for Christ is born;  With songs of joy let us loudly sing,  \\'Hallelujahs to Christ our King.\\'\"Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every  one on board theship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer,  evenas the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful dream onthat  Christmas morn.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE LAST PEARL  by Hans Christian Andersen  WE are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the servants, thefriends of the family  are full of joy and felicity.\"\\nFor on this daya son and heir has been born, and mother  and child are doing well.\"\\nThelamp in the bed-chamber had been partly shaded, and the  windows werecovered with heavy curtains of some costly silken material.\"\\nThe carpetwas  thick and soft, like a covering of moss.\"\\nEverything invited toslumber, everything  had a charming look of repose; and so the nursehad discovered, for she slept; and  well she might sleep, whileeverything around her told of happiness and blessing.\"\\nThe  guardianangel of the house leaned against the head of the bed; while overthe child  was spread, as it were, a net of shining stars, and eachstar was a pearl of happiness.\"\\n All the good stars of life hadbrought their gifts to the newly born; here sparkled  health, wealth,fortune, and love; in short, there seemed to be everything for whichman  could wish on earth.\"\\n \"Everything has been bestowed here,\" said the guardian angel.\"\\n \"No, not everything,\" said a voice near him- the voice of the goodangel of the child;  \"one fairy has not yet brought her gift, but shewill, even if years should elapse,  she will bring her gift; it isthe last pearl that is wanting.\"\\n  \"Wanting!\"\\n cried the guardian angel; \"nothing must be wantinghere; and if it is so,  let us fetch it; let us seek the powerfulfairy; let us go to her.\"\\n  \"She will come, she will come some day unsought!\"\\n  \"Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that thecrown, when worn, may be  complete.\"\\nWhere is she to be found?\"\\nWheredoes she dwell?\"\\n said the guardian angel.\"\\n \"Tell me, and I will procurethe pearl.\"\\n  \"Will you do that?\"\\n replied the good angel of the child.\"\\n\"Then Iwill lead you to her  directly, wherever she may be.\"\\nShe has no abidingplace; she rules in the palace of  the emperor, sometimes she entersthe peasant\\'s humble cot; she passes no one without  leaving a trace ofher presence.\"\\nShe brings her gift with her, whether it is a world  or abauble.\"\\nTo this child she must come.\"\\nYou think that to wait for thistime would  be long and useless.\"\\nWell, then, let us go for thispearl- the only one lacking amidst  all this wealth.\"\\n  Then hand-in-hand they floated away to the spot where the fairywas now lingering.\"\\n It was in a large house with dark windows and emptyrooms, in which a peculiar stillness  reigned.\"\\nA whole row of windowsstood open, so that the rude wind could enter at its  pleasure, and thelong white curtains waved to and fro in the current of air.\"\\nIn  thecentre of one of the rooms stood an open coffin, in which lay the bodyof a woman,  still in the bloom of youth and very beautiful.\"\\nFreshroses were scattered over her.\"\\n The delicate folded hands and the nobleface glorified in death by the solemn, earnest  look, which spoke of anentrance into a better world, were alone visible.\"\\nAround the  coffinstood the husband and children, a whole troop, the youngest in thefather\\'s arms.\"\\n They were come to take a last farewell look of theirmother.\"\\nThe husband kissed her  hand, which now lay like a witheredleaf, but which a short time before had been  diligently employed indeeds of love for them all.\"\\nTears of sorrow rolled down  theircheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word wasspoken.\"\\nThe  silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief.With silent steps, still sobbing,  they left the room.\"\\nA burninglight remained in the room, and a long, red wick rose  far above theflame, which fluttered in the draught of air.\"\\nStrange men came inand  placed the lid of the coffin over the dead, and drove the nailsfirmly in; while the  blows of the hammer resounded through thehouse, and echoed in the hearts that were  bleeding.\"\\n \"Whither art thou leading me?\"\\n asked the guardian angel.\"\\n\"Heredwells no fairy whose  pearl could be counted amongst the best gifts oflife.\"\\n  \"Yes, she is here; here in this sacred hour,\" replied the angel,pointing to a corner  of the room; and there,- where in herlife-time, the mother had taken her seat amidst  flowers andpictures: in that spot, where she, like the blessed fairy of thehouse,  had welcomed husband, children, and friends, and, like asunbeam, had spread joy and  cheerfulness around her, the centre andheart of them all,- there, in that very spot,  sat a strange woman,clothed in long, flowing garments, and occupying the place of  the deadwife and mother.\"\\nIt was the fairy, and her name was \"Sorrow.\"\\n A hottear rolled  into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl, glowing withall the colors of the rainbow.\"\\n The angel seized it: the, pearlglittered like a star with seven-fold radiance.\"\\nThe  pearl of Sorrow,the last, which must not be wanting, increases the lustre, andexplains  the meaning of all the other pearls.\"\\n \"Do you see the shimmer of the rainbow, which unites earth toheaven?\"\\n So has there  been a bridge built between this world and thenext.\"\\nThrough the night of the grave  we gaze upwards beyond thestars to the end of all things.\"\\nThen we glance at the pearl  of Sorrow,in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away toeternal  happiness.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE LITTLE ELDER-TREE MOTHER  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had gone outand got wet feet.\"\\n Nobody had the least idea how it had happened; theweather was quite dry.\"\\nHis mother  undressed him, put him to bed, andordered the teapot to be brought in, that she might  make him a goodcup of tea from the elder-tree blossoms, which is so warming.\"\\nAt thesame  time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself in theupper storey of the house  came in; he led a lonely life, for he had nowife and children; but he loved the children  of others very much,and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was  apleasure to hear him.\"\\n \"Now, drink your tea,\" said the mother; \"perhaps you will hear astory.\"\\n  \"Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,\" said the old man, and noddedsmilingly.\"\\n\"But how  did the little fellow get his wet feet?\"\\n he thenasked.\"\\n \"That,\" replied the mother, \"nobody can understand.\"\\n  \"Will you tell me a story?\"\\n asked the boy.\"\\n \"Yes, if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is thegutter in the little  street where you go to school.\"\\n  \"Just half as high as my top-boots,\" replied the boy; \"but thenI must stand in the  deepest holes.\"\\n  \"There, now we know where you got your wet feet,\" said the oldman.\"\\n\"I ought to tell  you a story, but the worst of it is, I do notknow any more.\"\\n  \"You can make one up,\" said the little boy.\"\\n\"Mother says you cantell a fairy tale  about anything you look at or touch.\"\\n  \"That is all very well, but such tales or stories are worthnothing!\"\\nNo, the right  ones come by themselves and knock at myforehead saying: \\'Here I am.\\'\"  \"Will not one knock soon?\"\\n asked the boy; and the mother smiledwhile she put elder-tree  blossoms into the teapot and poured boilingwater over them.\"\\n\"Pray, tell me a story.\"\\n  \"Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud, theyonly come when they  please.- But wait,\" he said suddenly, \"there isone.\"\\nLook at the teapot; there is a  story in it now.\"\\n  And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose upgradually, the elder-tree  blossoms sprang forth one by one, freshand white; long boughs came forth; even out  of the spout they grewup in all directions, and formed a bush- nay, a large elder  tree,which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtainsaside; and  there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!In the midst of the tree sat  a kindly-looking old woman with a strangedress; it was as green as the leaves, and  trimmed with large whiteblossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it was real  cloth,or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree.\"\\n \"What is this woman\\'s name?\"\\n asked the little boy.\"\\n \"Well, the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad,\" said theold man; \"but we do  not understand that.\"\\nOut in the sailors\\' quarterthey give her a better name; there  she is called elder-tree mother.Now, you must attentively listen to her and look at  the beautifulelder-tree.\"\\n \"Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out there;it grew in the corner  of an humble little yard; under this tree sattwo old people one afternoon in the  beautiful sunshine.\"\\nHe was an old,old sailor, and she his old wife; they had  alreadygreat-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their goldenwedding, but they  could not remember the date, and the elder-treemother was sitting in the tree and  looked as pleased as this one here.\\'I know very well when the golden wedding is to  take place,\\' she said;but they did not hear it- they were talking of bygone days.\"\\n \"\\'Well, do you remember?\\' said the old sailor, \\'when we were quitesmall and used to  run about and play- it was in the very same yardwhere we now are- we used to put little  branches into the ground andmake a garden.\\'  \"\\'Yes,\\' said the old woman, \\'I remember it very well; we used towater the branches,  and one of them, an elder-tree branch, tookroot, and grew and became the large tree  under which we are nowsitting as old people.\\'  \"\\'Certainly, you are right,\\' he said; \\'and in yonder cornerstood a large water-tub;  there I used to sail my boat, which I had cutout myself- it sailed so well; but soon  I had to sail somewhere else.\\'  \"\\'But first we went to school to learn something,\\' she said,\\'and then we were confirmed;  we both wept on that day, but in theafternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended  the high roundtower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and thesea;  then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the queenwere sailing about in  their magnificent boat on the canals.\\'  \"\\'But soon I had to sail about somewhere else, and for manyyears I was travelling  about far away from home.\\'  \"\\'And I often cried about you, for I was afraid lest you weredrowned and lying at  the bottom of the sea.\"\\nMany a time I got up inthe night and looked if the weathercock  had turned; it turned often,but you did not return.\"\\nI remember one day distinctly:  the rain waspouring down in torrents; the dust-man had come to the house where Iwas  in service; I went down with the dust-bin and stood for a momentin the doorway, and  looked at the dreadful weather.\"\\nThen the postmangave me a letter; it was from you.\"\\n Heavens!\"\\nhow that letter hadtravelled about.\"\\nI tore it open and read it; I cried and  laughed atthe same time, and was so happy!\"\\nTherein was written that you werestaying  in the hot countries, where the coffee grows.\"\\nThese must bemarvellous countries.\"\\nYou  said a great deal about them, and I read allwhile the rain was pouring down and I  was standing there with thedust-bin.\"\\nThen suddenly some one put his arm round my  waist-\\'  \"\\'Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,\\' said the oldman.\"\\n \"\\'I did not know that it was you- you had come as quickly asyour letter; and you looked  so handsome, and so you do still.\"\\nYouhad a large yellow silk handkerchief in your  pocket and a shininghat on.\"\\nYou looked so well, and the weather in the street  washorrible!\\'  \"\\'Then we married,\\' he said.\"\\n\\'Do you remember how we got our firstboy, and then Mary,  Niels, Peter, John, and Christian?\\'  \\'Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become usefulmembers of society,  whom everybody cares for.\\'  \"\\'And their children have had children again,\\' said the oldsailor.\"\\n\\'Yes, these are  children\\'s children, and they are strong andhealthy.\"\\nIf I am not mistaken, our wedding  took place at this seasonof the year.\\'  \"\\'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,\\' said the littleelder-tree mother,  stretching her head down between the two oldpeople, who thought that she was their  neighbour who was nodding tothem; they looked at each other and clasped hands.\"\\nSoon  afterwards thechildren and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that it wasthe  golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and happinessin the morning,  but the old people had forgotten it, although theyremembered things so well that had  passed many, many years ago.\"\\nTheelder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun  illuminated the facesof the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the  youngest ofthe grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that therewould  be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes;and the elder mother  nodded in the tree and cried \\'Hooray\\' with theothers.\"\\n  \"But that was no fairy tale,\" said the little boy who had listenedto it.\"\\n \"You will presently understand it,\" said the old man who toldthe story.\"\\n\"Let us ask  little elder-tree mother about it.\"\\n  \"That was no fairy tale,\" said the little elder-tree mother;\"but now it comes!\"\\nReal  life furnishes us with subjects for the mostwonderful fairy tales; for otherwise my  beautiful elder-bush could nothave grown forth out of the teapot.\"\\n  And then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him onher bosom; the elder  branches, full of blossoms, closed over them;it was as if they sat in a thick leafy  bower which flew with themthrough the air; it was beautiful beyond all description.\"\\n The littleelder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl, but herdress  was still of the same green material, covered with whiteblossoms, as the elder-tree  mother had worn; she had a real elderblossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same  flowers was wound roundher curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so blue that  itwas wonderful to look at them.\"\\nShe and the boy kissed each other,and then they were  of the same age and felt the same joys.\"\\nThey walkedhand in hand out of the bower,  and now stood at home in a beautifulflower garden.\"\\nNear the green lawn the father\\'s  walking-stick was tiedto a post.\"\\nThere was life in this stick for the little ones,  for assoon as they seated themselves upon it the polished knob turned into aneighing  horse\\'s head, a long black mane was fluttering in the wind,and four strong slender  legs grew out.\"\\nThe animal was fiery andspirited; they galloped round the lawn.\"\\n\"Hooray!\"\\n now we shall ride faraway, many miles!\"\\n said the boy; \"we shall ride to the  nobleman\\'sestate where we were last year.\"\\n And they rode round the lawn again,and  the little girl, who, as we know, was no other than the littleelder-tree mother,  continually cried, \"Now we are in the country!\"\\nDoyou see the farmhouse there, with  the large baking stove, whichprojects like a gigantic egg out of the wall into the  road?\"\\nTheelder-tree spreads its branches over it, and the cock struts about  andscratches for the hens.\"\\nLook how proud he is!\"\\nNow we are near thechurch; it stands  on a high hill, under the spreading oak trees; oneof them is half dead!\"\\nNow we are  at the smithy, where the fire roarsand the half-naked men beat with their hammers  so that the sparksfly far and wide.\"\\nLet\\'s be off to the beautiful farm!\"\\n And they  passedby everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick,described,  and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round thelawn.\"\\nThen they played in a  side-walk, and marked out a littlegarden on the ground; she took elder-blossoms out  of her hair andplanted them, and they grew exactly like those the old peopleplanted  when they were children, as we have heard before.\"\\nTheywalked about hand in hand, just  as the old couple had done when theywere little, but they did not go to the round  tower nor to theFredericksburg garden.\"\\nNo; the little girl seized the boy round  thewaist, and then they flew far into the country.\"\\nIt was spring and itbecame summer,  it was autumn and it became winter, and thousands ofpictures reflected themselves  in the boy\\'s eyes and heart, and thelittle girl always sang again, \"You will never  forget that!\"\\n Andduring their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; henoticed  the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt muchstronger, for the  flowers were fixed on the little girl\\'s bosom,against which the boy often rested his  head during the flight.\"\\n \"It is beautiful here in spring,\" said the little girl, and theywere again in the  green beechwood, where the thyme breathed forthsweet fragrance at their feet, and  the pink anemones looked lovelyin the green moss.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\nthat it were always spring  in the fragrantbeechwood!\"\\n  \"Here it is splendid in summer!\"\\n she said, and they passed byold castles of the age  of chivalry.\"\\nThe high walls and indentedbattlements were reflected in the water of  the ditches, on which swanswere swimming and peering into the old shady avenues.\"\\nThe  corn wavedin the field like a yellow sea.\"\\nRed and yellow flowers grew in theditches,  wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the hedges.\"\\nInthe evening the moon rose,  large and round, and the hayricks in themeadows smelt sweetly.\"\\n\"One can never forget  it!\"\\n  \"Here it is beautiful in autumn!\"\\n said the little girl, and theatmosphere seemed twice  as high and blue, while the wood shone withcrimson, green, and gold.\"\\nThe hounds were  running off, flocks ofwild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the bramble  bushestwined round the old stones.\"\\nThe dark-blue sea was covered withwhite-sailed  ships, and in the barns sat old women, girls, andchildren picking hops into a large  tub; the young ones sang songs, andthe old people told fairy tales about goblins and  sorcerers.\"\\nItcould not be more pleasant anywhere.\"\\n \"Here it\\'s agreeable in winter!\"\\n said the little girl, and all thetrees were covered  with hoar-frost, so that they looked like whitecoral.\"\\nThe snow creaked under one\\'s  feet, as if one had new bootson.\"\\nOne shooting star after another traversed the sky.\"\\n In the room theChristmas tree was lit, and there were song and merriment.\"\\nIn  thepeasant\\'s cottage the violin sounded, and games were played forapple quarters;  even the poorest child said, \"It is beautiful inwinter!\"\\n  And indeed it was beautiful!\"\\nAnd the little girl showed everythingto the boy, and  the elder-tree continued to breathe forth sweetperfume, while the red flag with the  white cross was streaming inthe wind; it was the flag under which the old sailor had  served.\"\\nTheboy became a youth; he was to go out into the wide world, far awayto the  countries where the coffee grows.\"\\nBut at parting the littlegirl took an elder-blossom  from her breast and gave it to him as akeepsake.\"\\nHe placed it in his prayer-book,  and when he opened it indistant lands it was always at the place where the flower  ofremembrance was lying; and the more he looked at it the fresher itbecame, so that  he could almost smell the fragrance of the woods athome.\"\\nHe distinctly saw the little  girl, with her bright blue eyes,peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her  whispering, \"Here itis beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn, and in winter,\"  andhundreds of pictures passed through his mind.\"\\n Thus many years rolled by.\"\\nHe had now become an old man, and wassitting, with his  old wife, under an elder-tree in full bloom.\"\\nTheyheld each other by the hand exactly  as the great-grandfather and thegreat-grandmother had done outside, and, like them,  they talkedabout bygone days and of their golden wedding.\"\\nThe little girl withthe  blue eyes and elder-blossoms in her hair was sitting high up inthe tree, and nodded  to them, saying, \"To-day is the goldenwedding!\"\\n And then she took two flowers out  of her wreath and kissedthem.\"\\nThey glittered at first like silver, then like gold,  and whenshe placed them on the heads of the old people each flower became agolden  crown.\"\\nThere they both sat like a king and queen under thesweet-smelling tree, which  looked exactly like an elder-tree, and hetold his wife the story of the elder-tree  mother as it had been toldhim when he was a little boy.\"\\nThey were both of opinion  that the storycontained many points like their own, and these similarities theyliked  best.\"\\n \"Yes, so it is,\" said the little girl in the tree.\"\\n\"Some call meLittle Elder-tree  Mother; others a Dryad; but my real name is\\'Remembrance.\\' It is I who sit in the tree  which grows and grows.\"\\nIcan remember things and tell stories!\"\\nBut let\\'s see if you  havestill got your flower.\"\\n  And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom wasstill in it, and as fresh  as if it had only just been put in.Remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with  the golden crownson their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun.\"\\nThey closed their  eyesand- and\\ufffeWell, now the story is ended!\"\\nThe little boy in bed did not knowwhether he had dreamt  it or heard it told;

poor little  child, she looked the picture of misery.\"\\nThesnowflakes fell on her long, fair hair,  which hung in curls on hershoulders, but she regarded them not.\"\\n Lights were shining from every window, and there was a savorysmell of roast goose,  for it was New-year\\'s eve- yes, she rememberedthat.\"\\nIn a corner, between two houses,  one of which projected beyondthe other, she sank down and huddled herself together.\"\\n She had drawnher little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; andshe  dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not takehome even a penny  of money.\"\\nHer father would certainly beat her;besides, it was almost as cold at home  as here, for they had onlythe roof to cover them, through which the wind howled,  although thelargest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags.\"\\nHer littlehands  were almost frozen with the cold.\"\\nAh!\"\\nperhaps a burning matchmight be some good, if  she could draw it from the bundle and strike itagainst the wall, just to warm her  fingers.\"\\nShe drew oneout-\"scratch!\"\\n how it sputtered as it burnt!\"\\nIt gave a warm,  brightlight, like a little candle, as she held her hand over it.\"\\nIt wasreally a  wonderful light.\"\\nIt seemed to the little girl that she wassitting by a large iron  stove, with polished brass feet and a brassornament.\"\\nHow the fire burned!\"\\nand seemed  so beautifully warm that thechild stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when,  lo!\"\\nthe flameof the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only theremains  of the half-burnt match in her hand.\"\\n She rubbed another match on the wall.\"\\nIt burst into a flame, andwhere its light fell  upon the wall it became as transparent as a veil,and she could see into the room.\"\\n The table was covered with a snowywhite table-cloth, on which stood a splendid dinner  service, and asteaming roast goose, stuffed with apples and dried plums.\"\\nAnd whatwas  still more wonderful, the goose jumped down from the dish andwaddled across the floor,  with a knife and fork in its breast, tothe little girl.\"\\nThen the match went out, and  there remained nothingbut the thick, damp, cold wall before her.\"\\n She lighted another match, and then she found herself sittingunder a beautiful  Christmas-tree.\"\\nIt was larger and more beautifullydecorated than the one which she  had seen through the glass door atthe rich merchant\\'s.\"\\nThousands of tapers were  burning upon the greenbranches, and colored pictures, like those she had seen in  theshow-windows, looked down upon it all.\"\\nThe little one stretched outher hand towards  them, and the match went out.\"\\n The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked toher like the stars  in the sky.\"\\nThen she saw a star fall, leavingbehind it a bright streak of fire.\"\\n\"Some  one is dying,\" thought thelittle girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had  everloved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a starfalls, a soul was  going up to God.\"\\n She again rubbed a match on the wall, and the light shone roundher; in the brightness  stood her old grandmother, clear and shining,yet mild and loving in her appearance.\"\\n \"Grandmother,\" cried the littleone, \"O take me with you; I know you will go away when  the match burnsout; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and thelarge,  glorious Christmas-tree.\"\\n And she made haste to light the wholebundle of matches,  for she wished to keep her grandmother there.\"\\nAndthe matches glowed with a light that  was brighter than the noon-day,and her grandmother had never appeared so large or  so beautiful.\"\\nShetook the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards  inbrightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither coldnor hunger nor  pain, for they were with God.\"\\n In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with palecheeks and smiling  mouth, leaning against the wall; she had beenfrozen to death on the last evening of  the year; and the New-year\\'ssun rose and shone upon a little corpse!\"\\nThe child still  sat, in thestiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle ofwhich  was burnt.\"\\n\"She tried to warm herself,\" said some.\"\\nNo oneimagined what beautiful  things she had seen, nor into what glory shehad entered with her grandmother, on  New-year\\'s day.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE LITTLE MERMAID  by Hans Christian Andersen  FAR out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as theprettiest cornflower, and as  clear as crystal, it is very, verydeep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom  it: many churchsteeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the  groundbeneath to the surface of the water above.\"\\nThere dwell the Sea Kingand his  subjects.\"\\nWe must not imagine that there is nothing at thebottom of the sea but bare  yellow sand.\"\\nNo, indeed; the mostsingular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves  and stems ofwhich are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the watercauses them  to stir as if they had life.\"\\nFishes, both large and small,glide between the branches,  as birds fly among the trees here uponland.\"\\nIn the deepest spot of all, stands the  castle of the Sea King.Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows  are ofthe clearest amber.\"\\nThe roof is formed of shells, that open andclose as the  water flows over them.\"\\nTheir appearance is verybeautiful, for in each lies a  glittering pearl, which would be fit forthe diadem of a queen.\"\\n The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his agedmother kept house for  him.\"\\nShe was a very wise woman, andexceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account  she wore twelveoysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were onlyallowed  to wear six.\"\\nShe was, however, deserving of very great praise,especially for her care  of the little sea-princesses, hergrand-daughters.\"\\nThey were six beautiful children;  but the youngestwas the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate  as arose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like allthe others, she  had no feet, and her body ended in a fish\\'s tail.All day long they played in the great  halls of the castle, or amongthe living flowers that grew out of the walls.\"\\nThe large  amber windowswere open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into ourhouses  when we open the windows, excepting that the fishes swam upto the princesses, ate  out of their hands, and allowed themselves tobe stroked.\"\\nOutside the castle there  was a beautiful garden, inwhich grew bright red and dark blue flowers, and blossoms  likeflames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold, and the leaves andstems waved to  and fro continually.\"\\nThe earth itself was the finestsand, but blue as the flame of  burning sulphur.\"\\nOver everything laya peculiar blue radiance, as if it were surrounded  by the air fromabove, through which the blue sky shone, instead of the dark depths  ofthe sea.\"\\nIn calm weather the sun could be seen, looking like apurple flower, with  the light streaming from the calyx.\"\\nEach of theyoung princesses had a little plot  of ground in the garden, whereshe might dig and plant as she pleased.\"\\nOne arranged  her flower-bedinto the form of a whale; another thought it better to make herslike  the figure of a little mermaid; but that of the youngest wasround like the sun, and  contained flowers as red as his rays atsunset.\"\\nShe was a strange child, quiet and  thoughtful; and while hersisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which  theyobtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but herpretty red  flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue.It was the representation  of a handsome boy, carved out of purewhite stone, which had fallen to the bottom of  the sea from a wreck.She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow.\"\\nIt  grewsplendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue,almost down  to the blue sands.\"\\nThe shadow had a violet tint, and wavedto and fro like the branches;  it seemed as if the crown of the treeand the root were at play, and trying to kiss  each other.\"\\nNothing gaveher so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the  sea.\"\\nShemade her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of thetowns,  the people and the animals.\"\\nTo her it seemed most wonderful andbeautiful to hear that  the flowers of the land should havefragrance, and not those below the sea; that the  trees of the forestshould be green; and that the fishes among the trees could sing  sosweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear them.\"\\nHer grandmothercalled the little  birds fishes, or she would not have understoodher; for she had never seen birds.\"\\n \"When you have reached your fifteenth year,\" said thegrand-mother, \"you will have  permission to rise up out of the sea,to sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the  great ships aresailing by; and then you will see both forests and towns.\"\\n  In the following year, one of the sisters would be fifteen: but aseach was a year  younger than the other, the youngest would have towait five years before her turn  came to rise up from the bottom of theocean, and see the earth as we do.\"\\nHowever,  each promised to tellthe others what she saw on her first visit, and what she thought  themost beautiful; for their grandmother could not tell them enough;there were so  many things on which they wanted information.\"\\nNone ofthem longed so much for her turn  to come as the youngest, she whohad the longest time to wait, and who was so quiet  and thoughtful.Many nights she stood by the open window, looking up through thedark  blue water, and watching the fish as they splashed about withtheir fins and tails.\"\\n She could see the moon and stars shiningfaintly; but through the water they looked  larger than they do toour eyes.\"\\nWhen something like a black cloud passed between her  andthem, she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head, or aship full  of human beings, who never imagined that a pretty littlemermaid was standing beneath  them, holding out her white hands towardsthe keel of their ship.\"\\n As soon as the eldest was fifteen, she was allowed to rise tothe surface of the ocean.\"\\n When she came back, she had hundreds ofthings to talk about; but the most beautiful,  she said, was to liein the moonlight, on a sandbank, in the quiet sea, near the coast,  andto gaze on a large town nearby, where the lights were twinkling likehundreds of  stars; to listen to the sounds of the music, the noiseof carriages, and the voices  of human beings, and then to hear themerry bells peal out from the church steeples;  and because she couldnot go near to all those wonderful things, she longed for them  morethan ever.\"\\nOh, did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all thesedescriptions?\"\\n and afterwards, when she stood at the open windowlooking up through the dark blue  water, she thought of the great city,with all its bustle and noise, and even fancied  she could hear thesound of the church bells, down in the depths of the sea.\"\\n In another year the second sister received permission to rise tothe surface of the  water, and to swim about where she pleased.\"\\nSherose just as the sun was setting, and  this, she said, was the mostbeautiful sight of all.\"\\nThe whole sky looked like gold,  while violetand rose-colored clouds, which she could not describe, floated overher;  and, still more rapidly than the clouds, flew a large flock ofwild swans towards the  setting sun, looking like a long white veilacross the sea.\"\\nShe also swam towards the  sun; but it sunk into thewaves, and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from  the sea.\"\\n The third sister\\'s turn followed; she was the boldest of them all,and she swam up  a broad river that emptied itself into the sea.\"\\nOn thebanks she saw green hills covered  with beautiful vines; palaces andcastles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the  forest; sheheard the birds singing, and the rays of the sun were so powerful thatshe  was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burningface.\"\\nIn a narrow  creek she found a whole troop of little humanchildren, quite naked, and sporting about  in the water; she wantedto play with them, but they fled in a great fright; and then  alittle black animal came to the water; it was a dog, but she did notknow that, for  she had never before seen one.\"\\nThis animal barked ather so terribly that she became  frightened, and rushed back to theopen sea.\"\\nBut she said she should never forget the  beautiful forest,the green hills, and the pretty little children who could swim inthe  water, although they had not fish\\'s tails.\"\\n The fourth sister was more timid; she remained in the midst of thesea, but she said  it was quite as beautiful there as nearer theland.\"\\nShe could see for so many miles  around her, and the sky abovelooked like a bell of glass.\"\\nShe had seen the ships,  but at such agreat distance that they looked like sea-gulls.\"\\nThe dolphins sportedin  the waves, and the great whales spouted water from their nostrilstill it seemed as  if a hundred fountains were playing in everydirection.\"\\n The fifth sister\\'s birthday occurred in the winter; so when herturn came, she saw  what the others had not seen the first time theywent up.\"\\nThe sea looked quite green,  and large icebergs werefloating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and  loftierthan the churches built by men.\"\\nThey were of the most singular shapes,and  glittered like diamonds.\"\\nShe had seated herself upon one of thelargest, and let the  wind play with her long hair, and she remarkedthat all the ships sailed by rapidly,  and steered as far away asthey could from the iceberg, as if they were afraid of it.\"\\n Towardsevening, as the sun went down, dark clouds covered the sky, thethunder rolled  and the lightning flashed, and the red light glowedon the icebergs as they rocked  and tossed on the heaving sea.\"\\nOn allthe ships the sails were reefed with fear and  trembling, while she satcalmly on the floating iceberg, watching the blue lightning,  as itdarted its forked flashes into the sea.\"\\n When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface, theywere each delighted  with the new and beautiful sights they saw; butnow, as grown-up girls, they could  go when they pleased, and theyhad become indifferent about it.\"\\nThey wished themselves  back againin the water, and after a month had passed they said it was muchmore  beautiful down below, and pleasanter to be at home.\"\\nYet often, inthe evening hours,  the five sisters would twine their arms roundeach other, and rise to the surface,  in a row.\"\\nThey had more beautifulvoices than any human being could have; and before  the approach of astorm, and when they expected a ship would be lost, they swam  beforethe vessel, and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depthsof the  sea, and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to thebottom.\"\\nBut the sailors  could not understand the song, they took itfor the howling of the storm.\"\\nAnd these  things were never to bebeautiful for them; for if the ship sank, the men were drowned,  andtheir dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King.\"\\n When the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in thisway, their youngest sister  would stand quite alone, looking afterthem, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have  no tears, andtherefore they suffer more.\"\\n\"Oh, were I but fifteen years old,\" saidshe:  \"I know that I shall love the world up there, and all thepeople who live in it.\"\\n  At last she reached her fifteenth year.\"\\n\"Well, now, you aregrown up,\" said the old  dowager, her grandmother; \"so you must letme adorn you like your other sisters;\" and  she placed a wreath ofwhite lilies in her hair, and every flower leaf was half a pearl.\"\\n Thenthe old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to thetail of the  princess to show her high rank.\"\\n \"But they hurt me so,\" said the little mermaid.\"\\n \"Pride must suffer pain,\" replied the old lady.\"\\nOh, how gladly shewould have shaken  off all this grandeur, and laid aside the heavywreath!\"\\nThe red flowers in her own  garden would have suited her muchbetter, but she could not help herself: so she said,  \"Farewell,\" androse as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water.\"\\nThe sun hadjust  set as she raised her head above the waves; but the clouds weretinted with crimson  and gold, and through the glimmering twilightbeamed the evening star in all its beauty.\"\\n The sea was calm, and theair mild and fresh.\"\\nA large ship, with three masts, lay  becalmed onthe water, with only one sail set; for not a breeze stiffed, and thesailors  sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging.\"\\nThere was music andsong on board; and, as  darkness came on, a hundred colored lanternswere lighted, as if the flags of all  nations waved in the air.\"\\nThelittle mermaid swam close to the cabin windows; and now  and then, asthe waves lifted her up, she could look in through clear glasswindow-panes,  and see a number of well-dressed people within.\"\\nAmongthem was a young prince, the  most beautiful of all, with large blackeyes; he was sixteen years of age, and his  birthday was being keptwith much rejoicing.\"\\nThe sailors were dancing on deck, but  when theprince came out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets rose inthe air,  making it as bright as day.\"\\nThe little mermaid was sostartled that she dived under  water; and when she again stretchedout her head, it appeared as if all the stars of  heaven were fallingaround her, she had never seen such fireworks before.\"\\nGreat  sunsspurted fire about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, andeverything was  reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath.\"\\nThe shipitself was so brightly illuminated  that all the people, and even thesmallest rope, could be distinctly and plainly seen.\"\\n And howhandsome the young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of allpresent and  smiled at them, while the music resounded through theclear night air.\"\\n It was very late; yet the little mermaid could not take her eyesfrom the ship, or  from the beautiful prince.\"\\nThe colored lanternshad been extinguished, no more rockets  rose in the air, and the cannonhad ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and  a moaning,grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves: still the littlemermaid  remained by the cabin window, rocking up and down on thewater, which enabled her to  look in.\"\\nAfter a while, the sails werequickly unfurled, and the noble ship continued  her passage; but soonthe waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the sky, and  lightningappeared in the distance.\"\\nA dreadful storm was approaching; oncemore the  sails were reefed, and the great ship pursued her flyingcourse over the raging sea.\"\\n The waves rose mountains high, as ifthey would have overtopped the mast; but the ship  dived like a swanbetween them, and then rose again on their lofty, foaming crests.\"\\n Tothe little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport; not so to thesailors.\"\\nAt length  the ship groaned and creaked; the thick planks gaveway under the lashing of the sea  as it broke over the deck; themainmast snapped asunder like a reed; the ship lay over  on her side;and the water rushed in.\"\\nThe little mermaid now perceived that thecrew  were in danger; even she herself was obliged to be careful toavoid the beams and planks  of the wreck which lay scattered on thewater.\"\\nAt one moment it was so pitch dark that  she could not see asingle object, but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene;she  could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince;when the ship parted,  she had seen him sink into the deep waves, andshe was glad, for she thought he would  now be with her; and then sheremembered that human beings could not live in the water,  so that whenhe got down to her father\\'s palace he would be quite dead.\"\\nBut he mustnot  die.\"\\nSo she swam about among the beams and planks which strewedthe surface of the  sea, forgetting that they could crush her topieces.\"\\nThen she dived deeply under the  dark waters, rising andfalling with the waves, till at length she managed to reach  theyoung prince, who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormysea.\"\\nHis  limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were closed, andhe would have died had  not the little mermaid come to hisassistance.\"\\nShe held his head above the water, and  let the waves driftthem where they would.\"\\n In the morning the storm had ceased; but of the ship not asingle fragment could be  seen.\"\\nThe sun rose up red and glowing fromthe water, and its beams brought back the  hue of health to theprince\\'s cheeks; but his eyes remained closed.\"\\nThe mermaid  kissedhis high, smooth forehead, and stroked back his wet hair; he seemed toher like  the marble statue in her little garden, and she kissed himagain, and wished that he  might live.\"\\nPresently they came in sightof land; she saw lofty blue mountains, on  which the white snowrested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them.\"\\nNear the  coastwere beautiful green forests, and close by stood a large building,whether a  church or a convent she could not tell.\"\\nOrange and citrontrees grew in the garden,  and before the door stood lofty palms.\"\\nThesea here formed a little bay, in which the  water was quite still,but very deep; so she swam with the handsome prince to the  beach,which was covered with fine, white sand, and there she laid him in thewarm  sunshine, taking care to raise his head higher than his body.Then bells sounded in  the large white building, and a number ofyoung girls came into the garden.\"\\nThe little  mermaid swam outfarther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks  thatrose out of the water; then she covered her head and neck with thefoam of the  sea so that her little face might not be seen, and watchedto see what would become  of the poor prince.\"\\nShe did not wait longbefore she saw a young girl approach the  spot where he lay.\"\\nShe seemedfrightened at first, but only for a moment; then she  fetched anumber of people, and the mermaid saw that the prince came to lifeagain,  and smiled upon those who stood round him.\"\\nBut to her he sentno smile; he knew not  that she had saved him.\"\\nThis made her veryunhappy, and when he was led away into the  great building, she diveddown sorrowfully into the water, and returned to her  father\\'scastle.\"\\nShe had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she wasmore so  than ever.\"\\nHer sisters asked her what she had seen duringher first visit to the surface  of the water; but she would tell themnothing.\"\\nMany an evening and morning did she  rise to the place whereshe had left the prince.\"\\nShe saw the fruits in the garden ripen  tillthey were gathered, the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away;but she never  saw the prince, and therefore she returned home,always more sorrowful than before.\"\\n It was her only comfort to sit inher own little garden, and fling her arm round the  beautiful marblestatue which was like the prince; but she gave up tending her  flowers,and they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining their longleaves and  stems round the branches of the trees, so that the wholeplace became dark and gloomy.\"\\n At length she could bear it no longer,and told one of her sisters all about it.\"\\nThen  the others heard thesecret, and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose  intimatefriend happened to know who the prince was.\"\\nShe had also seen thefestival  on board ship, and she told them where the prince camefrom, and where his palace stood.\"\\n \"Come, little sister,\" said the other princesses; then theyentwined their arms and  rose up in a long row to the surface of thewater, close by the spot where they knew  the prince\\'s palace stood.\"\\nItwas built of bright yellow shining stone, with long  flights ofmarble steps, one of which reached quite down to the sea.\"\\nSplendidgilded  cupolas rose over the roof, and between the pillars thatsurrounded the whole building  stood life-like statues of marble.Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could  be seen noblerooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry; while thewalls  were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure tolook at.\"\\nIn the centre  of the largest saloon a fountain threw itssparkling jets high up into the glass cupola  of the ceiling, throughwhich the sun shone down upon the water and upon the  beautifulplants growing round the basin of the fountain.\"\\nNow that she knewwhere he  lived, she spent many an evening and many a night on thewater near the palace.\"\\nShe  would swim much nearer the shore than anyof the others ventured to do; indeed once  she went quite up the narrowchannel under the marble balcony, which threw a broad  shadow on thewater.\"\\nHere she would sit and watch the young prince, who thoughthimself  quite alone in the bright moonlight.\"\\nShe saw him many times ofan evening sailing in  a pleasant boat, with music playing and flagswaving.\"\\nShe peeped out from among the  green rushes, and if the windcaught her long silvery-white veil, those who saw it  believed it to bea swan, spreading out its wings.\"\\nOn many a night, too, when  thefishermen, with their torches, were out at sea, she heard themrelate so many good  things about the doings of the young prince,that she was glad she had saved his life  when he had been tossed abouthalf-dead on the waves.\"\\nAnd she remembered that his head  had rested onher bosom, and how heartily she had kissed him; but he knew nothing ofall  this, and could not even dream of her.\"\\nShe grew more and more fondof human beings,  and wished more and more to be able to wander aboutwith those whose world seemed to  be so much larger than her own.They could fly over the sea in ships, and mount the  high hills whichwere far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed, their  woodsand their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight.There was  so much that she wished to know, and her sisters were unableto answer all her questions.\"\\n Then she applied to her oldgrandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which  she veryrightly called the lands above the sea.\"\\n \"If human beings are not drowned,\" asked the little mermaid,\"can they live forever?\"\\n do they never die as we do here in the sea?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" replied the old lady, \"they must also die, and their termof life is even shorter  than ours.\"\\nWe sometimes live to threehundred years, but when we cease to exist here  we only become the foamon the surface of the water, and we have not even a grave down  here ofthose we love.\"\\nWe have not immortal souls, we shall never liveagain; but, like  the green sea-weed, when once it has been cut off, wecan never flourish more.\"\\nHuman  beings, on the contrary, have a soulwhich lives forever, lives after the body has  been turned to dust.It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond the glittering  stars.As we rise out of the water, and behold all the land of the earth,so do they  rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall neversee.\"\\n  \"Why have not we an immortal soul?\"\\n asked the little mermaidmournfully; \"I would give  gladly all the hundreds of years that I haveto live, to be a human being only for  one day, and to have the hope ofknowing the happiness of that glorious world above  the stars.\"\\n  \"You must not think of that,\" said the old woman; \"we feelourselves to be much happier  and much better off than human beings.\"\\n  \"So I shall die,\" said the little mermaid, \"and as the foam of thesea I shall be driven  about never again to hear the music of thewaves, or to see the pretty flowers nor  the red sun.\"\\nIs there anythingI can do to win an immortal soul?\"\\n  \"No,\" said the old woman, \"unless a man were to love you so muchthat you were more  to him than his father or mother; and if all histhoughts and all his love were fixed  upon you, and the priest placedhis right hand in yours, and he promised to be true  to you here andhereafter, then his soul would glide into your body and you wouldobtain  a share in the future happiness of mankind.\"\\nHe would give asoul to you and retain  his own as well; but this can never happen.Your fish\\'s tail, which amongst us is  considered so beautiful, isthought on earth to be quite ugly; they do not know any  better, andthey think it necessary to have two stout props, which they call legs,in  order to be handsome.\"\\n  Then the little mermaid sighed, and looked sorrowfully at herfish\\'s tail.\"\\n\"Let us  be happy,\" said the old lady, \"and dart andspring about during the three hundred years  that we have to live,which is really quite long enough; after that we can rest  ourselvesall the better.\"\\nThis evening we are going to have a court ball.\"\\n  It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see onearth.\"\\nThe walls and the  ceiling of the large ball-room were of thick,but transparent crystal.\"\\nMay hundreds  of colossal shells, some of adeep red, others of a grass green, stood on each side  in rows, withblue fire in them, which lighted up the whole saloon, and shonethrough  the walls, so that the sea was also illuminated.\"\\nInnumerablefishes, great and small,  swam past the crystal walls; on some ofthem the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy,  and on others theyshone like silver and gold.\"\\nThrough the halls flowed a broad  stream,and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their ownsweet  singing.\"\\nNo one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs.The little mermaid sang  more sweetly than them all.\"\\nThe whole courtapplauded her with hands and tails; and  for a moment her heart feltquite gay, for she knew she had the loveliest voice of  any on earth orin the sea.\"\\nBut she soon thought again of the world above her, for  shecould not forget the charming prince, nor her sorrow that she hadnot an immortal  soul like his; therefore she crept away silently outof her father\\'s palace, and while  everything within was gladness andsong, she sat in her own little garden sorrowful  and alone.\"\\nThen sheheard the bugle sounding through the water, and thought- \"He  iscertainly sailing above, he on whom my wishes depend, and in whosehands I should  like to place the happiness of my life.\"\\nI willventure all for him, and to win an  immortal soul, while my sisters aredancing in my father\\'s palace, I will go to the  sea witch, of whom Ihave always been so much afraid, but she can give me counsel  andhelp.\"\\n  And then the little mermaid went out from her garden, and took theroad to the foaming  whirlpools, behind which the sorceress lived.She had never been that way before:  neither flowers nor grass grewthere; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched  out to thewhirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill-wheels, whirled  roundeverything that it seized, and cast it into the fathomless deep.Through the midst  of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaidwas obliged to pass, to reach the  dominions of the sea witch; and alsofor a long distance the only road lay right across  a quantity of warm,bubbling mire, called by the witch her turfmoor.\"\\nBeyond this stood  herhouse, in the centre of a strange forest, in which all the trees andflowers were  polypi, half animals and half plants; they looked likeserpents with a hundred heads  growing out of the ground.\"\\nThebranches were long slimy arms, with fingers like  flexible worms,moving limb after limb from the root to the top.\"\\nAll that could  bereached in the sea they seized upon, and held fast, so that it neverescaped from  their clutches.\"\\nThe little mermaid was so alarmed at whatshe saw, that she stood still,  and her heart beat with fear, and shewas very nearly turning back; but she thought  of the prince, and ofthe human soul for which she longed, and her courage returned.\"\\n Shefastened her long flowing hair round her head, so that the polypimight not seize  hold of it.\"\\nShe laid her hands together across herbosom, and then she darted forward  as a fish shoots through the water,between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly  polypi, which werestretched out on each side of her.\"\\nShe saw that each held in its  graspsomething it had seized with its numerous little arms, as if they wereiron bands.\"\\n The white skeletons of human beings who had perished atsea, and had sunk down into  the deep waters, skeletons of landanimals, oars, rudders, and chests of ships were  lying tightly graspedby their clinging arms; even a little mermaid, whom they had  caughtand strangled; and this seemed the most shocking of all to thelittle princess.\"\\n She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood, where large,fat water-snakes  were rolling in the mire, and showing their ugly,drab-colored bodies.\"\\nIn the midst  of this spot stood a house, builtwith the bones of shipwrecked human beings.\"\\nThere  sat the sea witch,allowing a toad to eat from her mouth, just as people sometimes  feed acanary with a piece of sugar.\"\\nShe called the ugly water-snakes herlittle  chickens, and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom.\"\\n \"I know what you want,\" said the sea witch; \"it is very stupidof you, but you shall  have your way, and it will bring you tosorrow, my pretty princess.\"\\nYou want to get  rid of your fish\\'s tail,and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings  on earth, sothat the young prince may fall in love with you, and that you may havean  immortal soul.\"\\n And then the witch laughed so loud anddisgustingly, that the toad  and the snakes fell to the ground, and laythere wriggling about.\"\\n\"You are but just  in time,\" said the witch;\"for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help  you till theend of another year.\"\\nI will prepare a draught for you, with whichyou must  swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit down on theshore and drink it.\"\\nYour  tail will then disappear, and shrink upinto what mankind calls legs, and you will  feel great pain, as if asword were passing through you.\"\\nBut all who see you will say  thatyou are the prettiest little human being they ever saw.\"\\nYou will stillhave the  same floating gracefulness of movement, and no dancer willever tread so lightly; but  at every step you take it will feel as ifyou were treading upon sharp knives, and  that the blood must flow.If you will bear all this, I will help you.\"\\n  \"Yes, I will,\" said the little princess in a trembling voice, asshe thought of the  prince and the immortal soul.\"\\n \"But think again,\" said the witch; \"for when once your shape hasbecome like a human  being, you can no more be a mermaid.\"\\nYou willnever return through the water to your  sisters, or to your father\\'spalace again; and if you do not win the love of the prince,  so that heis willing to forget his father and mother for your sake, and tolove you  with his whole soul, and allow the priest to join yourhands that you may be man and  wife, then you will never have animmortal soul.\"\\nThe first morning after he marries  another your heartwill break, and you will become foam on the crest of the waves.\"\\n  \"I will do it,\" said the little mermaid, and she became pale asdeath.\"\\n \"But I must be paid also,\" said the witch, \"and it is not a triflethat I ask.\"\\nYou  have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in thedepths of the sea, and you believe  that you will be able to charmthe prince with it also, but this voice you must give  to me; thebest thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught.\"\\nMy ownblood  must be mixed with it, that it may be as sharp as a two-edgedsword.\"\\n  \"But if you take away my voice,\" said the little mermaid, \"what isleft for me?\"\\n  \"Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your expressiveeyes; surely with these  you can enchain a man\\'s heart.\"\\nWell, haveyou lost your courage?\"\\nPut out your little  tongue that I may cut itoff as my payment; then you shall have the powerful draught.\"\\n  \"It shall be,\" said the little mermaid.\"\\n Then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire, to prepare themagic draught.\"\\n \"Cleanliness is a good thing,\" said she, scouring the vesselwith snakes, which she  had tied together in a large knot; then shepricked herself in the breast, and let  the black blood drop into it.The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible  shapes that noone could look at them without fear.\"\\nEvery moment the witch  threwsomething else into the vessel, and when it began to boil, the soundwas like  the weeping of a crocodile.\"\\nWhen at last the magic draughtwas ready, it looked like  the clearest water.\"\\n\"There it is for you,\"said the witch.\"\\nThen she cut off the  mermaid\\'s tongue, so that shebecame dumb, and would never again speak or sing.\"\\n\"If  the polypishould seize hold of you as you return through the wood,\" said thewitch,  \"throw over them a few drops of the potion, and their fingerswill be torn into a  thousand pieces.\"\\n But the little mermaid had nooccasion to do this, for the polypi  sprang back in terror when theycaught sight of the glittering draught, which shone  in her hand like atwinkling star.\"\\n So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh, andbetween the rushing  whirlpools.\"\\nShe saw that in her father\\'s palacethe torches in the ballroom were  extinguished, and all withinasleep; but she did not venture to go in to them, for  now she was dumband going to leave them forever, she felt as if her heart would  break.She stole into the garden, took a flower from the flower-beds ofeach of her  sisters, kissed her hand a thousand times towards thepalace, and then rose up through  the dark blue waters.\"\\nThe sun had notrisen when she came in sight of the prince\\'s  palace, and approachedthe beautiful marble steps, but the moon shone clear and  bright.Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught, and it seemed as if atwo-edged  sword went through her delicate body: she fell into a swoon,and lay like one dead.\"\\n When the sun arose and shone over the sea,she recovered, and felt a sharp pain; but  just before her stood thehandsome young prince.\"\\nHe fixed his coal-black eyes upon  her soearnestly that she cast down her own, and then became aware that herfish\\'s tail  was gone, and that she had as pretty a pair of whitelegs and tiny feet as any little  maiden could have; but she had noclothes, so she wrapped herself in her long, thick  hair.\"\\nThe princeasked her who she was, and where she came from, and she looked athim  mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes; but she couldnot speak.\"\\nEvery step  she took was as the witch had said it wouldbe, she felt as if treading upon the points  of needles or sharpknives; but she bore it willingly, and stepped as lightly by  theprince\\'s side as a soap-bubble, so that he and all who saw herwondered at her  graceful-swaying movements.\"\\nShe was very soonarrayed in costly robes of silk and  muslin, and was the most beautifulcreature in the palace; but she was dumb, and could  neither speaknor sing.\"\\n Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped forwardand sang before  the prince and his royal parents: one sang better thanall the others, and the prince  clapped his hands and smiled at her.This was great sorrow to the little mermaid; she  knew how much moresweetly she herself could sing once, and she thought, \"Oh if hecould  only know that!\"\\nI have given away my voice forever, to be withhim.\"\\n  The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances, to thesound of beautiful  music.\"\\nThen the little mermaid raised her lovelywhite arms, stood on the tips of her  toes, and glided over thefloor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance.\"\\nAt  each momenther beauty became more revealed, and her expressive eyes appealed  moredirectly to the heart than the songs of the slaves.\"\\nEvery one wasenchanted,  especially the prince, who called her his little foundling;and she danced again quite  readily, to please him, though each timeher foot touched the floor it seemed as if  she trod on sharp knives.\"\\n  The prince said she should remain with him always, and shereceived permission to sleep  at his door, on a velvet cushion.\"\\nHehad a page\\'s dress made for her, that she might  accompany him onhorseback.\"\\nThey rode together through the sweet-scented woods,  wherethe green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little birds sangamong the  fresh leaves.\"\\nShe climbed with the prince to the tops ofhigh mountains; and although  her tender feet bled so that even hersteps were marked, she only laughed, and followed  him till theycould see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birdstravelling  to distant lands.\"\\nWhile at the prince\\'s palace, and whenall the household were asleep,  she would go and sit on the broadmarble steps; for it eased her burning feet to bathe  them in thecold sea-water; and then she thought of all those below in the deep.\"\\n Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm, singingsorrowfully, as they  floated on the water.\"\\nShe beckoned to them, andthen they recognized her, and told  her how she had grieved them.\"\\nAfterthat, they came to the same place every night;  and once she saw in thedistance her old grandmother, who had not been to the surface  of thesea for many years, and the old Sea King, her father, with his crownon his head.\"\\n They stretched out their hands towards her, but theydid not venture so near the land  as her sisters did.\"\\n As the days passed, she loved the prince more fondly, and he lovedher as he would  love a little child, but it never came into his headto make her his wife; yet, unless  he married her, she could notreceive an immortal soul; and, on the morning after his  marriagewith another, she would dissolve into the foam of the sea.\"\\n \"Do you not love me the best of them all?\"\\n the eyes of thelittle mermaid seemed to  say, when he took her in his arms, and kissedher fair forehead.\"\\n \"Yes, you are dear to me,\" said the prince; \"for you have the bestheart, and you are  the most devoted to me; you are like a young maidenwhom I once saw, but whom I shall  never meet again.\"\\nI was in a shipthat was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near  a holy temple,where several young maidens performed the service.\"\\nThe youngest ofthem  found me on the shore, and saved my life.\"\\nI saw her but twice,and she is the only  one in the world whom I could love; but you arelike her, and you have almost driven  her image out of my mind.\"\\nShebelongs to the holy temple, and my good fortune has sent  you to meinstead of her; and we will never part.\"\\n  \"Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,\" thought thelittle mermaid.\"\\n\"I  carried him over the sea to the wood where thetemple stands: I sat beneath the foam,  and watched till the humanbeings came to help him.\"\\nI saw the pretty maiden that he  lovesbetter than he loves me;\" and the mermaid sighed deeply, but she couldnot shed  tears.\"\\n\"He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple,therefore she will never return  to the world.\"\\nThey will meet nomore: while I am by his side, and see him every day.\"\\n I will takecare of him, and love him, and give up my life for his sake.\"\\n  Very soon it was said that the prince must marry, and that thebeautiful daughter of  a neighboring king would be his wife, for a fineship was being fitted out.\"\\nAlthough  the prince gave out that he merelyintended to pay a visit to the king, it was generally  supposed that hereally went to see his daughter.\"\\nA great company were to go withhim.\"\\n The little mermaid smiled, and shook her head.\"\\nShe knew theprince\\'s thoughts better  than any of the others.\"\\n \"I must travel,\" he had said to her; \"I must see this beautifulprincess; my parents  desire it; but they will not oblige me to bringher home as my bride.\"\\nI cannot love  her; she is not like the beautifulmaiden in the temple, whom you resemble.\"\\nIf I were  forced to choosea bride, I would rather choose you, my dumb foundling, with  thoseexpressive eyes.\"\\n And then he kissed her rosy mouth, played with herlong waving  hair, and laid his head on her heart, while she dreamed ofhuman happiness and an  immortal soul.\"\\n\"You are not afraid of thesea, my dumb child,\" said he, as they stood  on the deck of the nobleship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring  king.And then he told her of storm and of calm, of strange fishes in thedeep beneath  them, and of what the divers had seen there; and shesmiled at his descriptions, for  she knew better than any one whatwonders were at the bottom of the sea.\"\\n In the moonlight, when all on board were asleep, excepting the manat the helm, who  was steering, she sat on the deck, gazing downthrough the clear water.\"\\nShe thought  she could distinguish herfather\\'s castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the  silvercrown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel of thevessel.\"\\n Then her sisters came up on the waves, and gazed at hermournfully, wringing their  white hands.\"\\nShe beckoned to them, andsmiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and  well off she was; butthe cabin-boy approached, and when her sisters dived down he  thoughtit was only the foam of the sea which he saw.\"\\n The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautifultown belonging to the  king whom the prince was going to visit.\"\\nThechurch bells were ringing, and from the  high towers sounded a flourishof trumpets; and soldiers, with flying colors and  glittering bayonets,lined the rocks through which they passed.\"\\nEvery day was a  festival;balls and entertainments followed one another.\"\\n But the princess had not yet appeared.\"\\nPeople said that she wasbeing brought up and  educated in a religious house, where she waslearning every royal virtue.\"\\nAt last she  came.\"\\nThen the littlemermaid, who was very anxious to see whether she was really  beautiful,was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfectvision  of beauty.\"\\nHer skin was delicately fair, and beneath her longdark eye-lashes her  laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity.\"\\n \"It was you,\" said the prince, \"who saved my life when I laydead on the beach,\" and  he folded his blushing bride in his arms.\"\\n\"Oh,I am too happy,\" said he to the little  mermaid; \"my fondest hopesare all fulfilled.\"\\nYou will rejoice at my happiness; for  your devotionto me is great and sincere.\"\\n  The little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her heartwere already broken.\"\\nHis  wedding morning would bring death to her, andshe would change into the foam of the  sea.\"\\nAll the church bellsrung, and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the  betrothal.Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar.\"\\nThepriests  waved the censers, while the bride and bridegroom joined theirhands and received the  blessing of the bishop.\"\\nThe little mermaid,dressed in silk and gold, held up the  bride\\'s train; but her earsheard nothing of the festive music, and her eyes saw not  the holyceremony; she thought of the night of death which was coming to her,and of  all she had lost in the world.\"\\nOn the same evening the brideand bridegroom went on  board ship; cannons were roaring, flags waving,and in the centre of the ship a costly  tent of purple and gold hadbeen erected.\"\\nIt contained elegant couches, for the  reception of thebridal pair during the night.\"\\nThe ship, with swelling sails and  afavorable wind, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea.When it grew dark  a number of colored lamps were lit, and thesailors danced merrily on the deck.\"\\nThe  little mermaid could nothelp thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she  had seensimilar festivities and joys; and she joined in the dance, poisedherself in  the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and allpresent cheered her with wonder.\"\\n She had never danced so elegantlybefore.\"\\nHer tender feet felt as if cut with sharp  knives, but shecared not for it; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart.\"\\nSheknew  this was the last evening she should ever see the prince, forwhom she had forsaken  her kindred and her home; she had given up herbeautiful voice, and suffered unheard-of  pain daily for him, whilehe knew nothing of it.\"\\nThis was the last evening that she  wouldbreathe the same air with him, or gaze on the starry sky and thedeep sea; an  eternal night, without a thought or a dream, awaited her:she had no soul and now she  could never win one.\"\\nAll was joy andgayety on board ship till long after midnight;  she laughed anddanced with the rest, while the thoughts of death were in her heart.The  prince kissed his beautiful bride, while she played with his ravenhair, till they  went arm-in-arm to rest in the splendid tent.\"\\nThen allbecame still on board the ship;  the helmsman, alone awake, stood atthe helm.\"\\nThe little mermaid leaned her white arms  on the edge ofthe vessel, and looked towards the east for the first blush ofmorning,  for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death.\"\\nShesaw her sisters rising out  of the flood: they were as pale as herself;but their long beautiful hair waved no  more in the wind, and hadbeen cut off.\"\\n \"We have given our hair to the witch,\" said they, \"to obtainhelp for you, that you  may not die to-night.\"\\nShe has given us a knife:here it is, see it is very sharp.\"\\nBefore  the sun rises you must plungeit into the heart of the prince; when the warm blood  falls upon yourfeet they will grow together again, and form into a fish\\'s tail, andyou  will be once more a mermaid, and return to us to live out yourthree hundred years  before you die and change into the salt seafoam.\"\\nHaste, then; he or you must die before  sunrise.\"\\nOur oldgrandmother moans so for you, that her white hair is falling offfrom  sorrow, as ours fell under the witch\\'s scissors.\"\\nKill theprince and come back; hasten:  do you not see the first red streaksin the sky?\"\\nIn a few minutes the sun will rise,  and you must die.\"\\n Andthen they sighed deeply and mournfully, and sank down beneath  thewaves.\"\\n The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent,and beheld the fair bride  with her head resting on the prince\\'sbreast.\"\\nShe bent down and kissed his fair brow,  then looked at the skyon which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter; then she  glanced atthe sharp knife, and again fixed her eyes on the prince, who whisperedthe  name of his bride in his dreams.\"\\nShe was in his thoughts, andthe knife trembled in  the hand of the little mermaid: then she flungit far away from her into the waves;  the water turned red where itfell, and the drops that spurted up looked like blood.\"\\n She cast onemore lingering, half-fainting glance at the prince, and then threwherself  from the ship into the sea, and thought her body wasdissolving into foam.\"\\nThe sun  rose above the waves, and his warmrays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid,  who did not feelas if she were dying.\"\\nShe saw the bright sun, and all around herfloated  hundreds of transparent beautiful beings; she could seethrough them the white sails  of the ship, and the red clouds in thesky; their speech was melodious, but too ethereal  to be heard bymortal ears, as they were also unseen by mortal eyes.\"\\nThe littlemermaid  perceived that she had a body like theirs, and that shecontinued to rise higher and  higher out of the foam.\"\\n\"Where am I?\"\\nasked she, and her voice sounded ethereal, as  the voice of those whowere with her; no earthly music could imitate it.\"\\n \"Among the daughters of the air,\" answered one of them.\"\\n\"A mermaidhas not an immortal  soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins thelove of a human being.\"\\nOn the power  of another hangs her eternaldestiny.\"\\nBut the daughters of the air, although they do  not possess animmortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves.We  fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that destroysmankind with the  pestilence.\"\\nWe carry the perfume of the flowers tospread health and restoration.\"\\nAfter  we have striven for three hundredyears to all the good in our power, we receive an  immortal soul andtake part in the happiness of mankind.\"\\nYou, poor little mermaid,have  tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing; you havesuffered and endured and  raised yourself to the spirit-world by yourgood deeds; and now, by striving for three  hundred years in the sameway, you may obtain an immortal soul.\"\\n  The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun,and felt them, for the  first time, filling with tears.\"\\nOn the ship, inwhich she had left the prince, there  were life and noise; she sawhim and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully  theygazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herselfinto the waves.\"\\n Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride, andfanned the prince, and then mounted  with the other children of the airto a rosy cloud that floated through the aether.\"\\n \"After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the kingdomof heaven,\" said she.\"\\n \"And we may even get there sooner,\" whisperedone of her companions.\"\\n\"Unseen we can  enter the houses of men, wherethere are children, and for every day on which we find  a good child,who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love, our time  ofprobation is shortened.\"\\nThe child does not know, when we fly throughthe room, that  we smile with joy at his good conduct, for we can countone year less of our three  hundred years.\"\\nBut when we see a naughty ora wicked child, we shed tears of sorrow,  and for every tear a day isadded to our time of trial!\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE LOVELIEST ROSE IN THE WORLD  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE lived once a great queen, in whose garden were found atall seasons the most  splendid flowers, and from every land in theworld.\"\\nShe specially loved roses, and  therefore she possessed the mostbeautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild  hedge-rose, with itsapple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose.\"\\nThey grew  nearthe shelter of the walls, wound themselves round columns andwindow-frames, crept  along passages and over the ceilings of thehalls.\"\\nThey were of every fragrance and  color.\"\\n But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon asick bed, and the  doctors declared that she must die.\"\\n\"There isstill one thing that could save her,\"  said one of the wisest amongthem.\"\\n\"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one  which exhibitsthe purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her beforeher  eyes close, she will not die.\"\\n  Then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed inevery garden, but  they were not the right sort.\"\\nThe flower must be onefrom the garden of love; but which  of the roses there showed forth thehighest and purest love?\"\\nThe poets sang of this  rose, the loveliest inthe world, and each named one which he considered worthy of  thattitle; and intelligence of what was required was sent far and wideto every heart  that beat with love; to every class, age, andcondition.\"\\n \"No one has yet named the flower,\" said the wise man.\"\\n\"No onehas pointed out the spot  where it blooms in all its splendor.\"\\nIt isnot a rose from the coffin of Romeo and  Juliet, or from the grave ofWalburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song.\"\\n It is notone of the roses which sprouted forth from the blood-stained fame  ofWinkelreid.\"\\nThe blood which flows from the breast of a hero who diesfor his country  is sacred, and his memory is sweet, and no rose can beredder than the blood which  flows from his veins.\"\\nNeither is it themagic flower of Science, to obtain which  wondrous flower a man devotesmany an hour of his fresh young life in sleepless nights,  in alonely chamber.\"\\n  \"I know where it blooms,\" said a happy mother, who came with herlovely child to the  bedside of the queen.\"\\n\"I know where theloveliest rose in the world is.\"\\nIt is seen  on the blooming cheeks ofmy sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love  of infancy;when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me withchildlike  affection.\"\\n  \"This is a lovely rose,\" said the wise man; \"but there is onestill more lovely.\"\\n  \"Yes, one far more lovely,\" said one of the women.\"\\n\"I have seenit, and a loftier and  purer rose does not bloom.\"\\nBut it was white,like the leaves of a blush-rose.\"\\nI saw  it on the cheeks of thequeen.\"\\nShe had taken off her golden crown, and through the  long,dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms.\"\\nShe wept overit, kissed  it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in thathour of her anguish.\"\\n  \"Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief, butit is not the one  we seek.\"\\n  \"No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord\\'s table,\"said the good old  bishop.\"\\n\"I saw it shine as if an angel\\'s face hadappeared.\"\\nA young maiden knelt at  the altar, and renewed the vows madeat her baptism;

he carried agreat book and the binding was of velvet,  with silver clasps.\"\\nMother,\" cried the little boy; \"only hear what I have read.\"\\n  Andthe child seated himself by the bedside, and read from the book of Himwho suffered  death on the cross to save all men, even who are yetunborn.\"\\nHe read, \"Greater love  hath no man than this,\" and as heread a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the  queen, and her eyesbecame so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of  thebook a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood onthe cross.\"\\n \"I see it,\" she said.\"\\n\"He who beholds this, the loveliest roseon earth, shall never  die.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE MAIL-COACH PASSENGERS  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not abreeze stirred.\"\\n\"Bump\"-  an old pot was thrown at a neighbor\\'s door;and \"bang, bang,\" went the guns; for they  were greeting the NewYear.\"\\nIt was New Year\\'s Eve, and the church clock was striking  twelve.\"\\nTan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra,\" sounded the horn, and the mail-coachcame  lumbering up.\"\\nThe clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the town;all the places had  been taken, for there were twelve passengers in thecoach.\"\\n \"Hurrah!\"\\nhurrah!\"\\n cried the people in the town; for in every housethe New Year was  being welcomed; and as the clock struck, they stoodup, the full glasses in their hands,  to drink success to the newcomer.\"\\n\"A happy New Year,\" was the cry; \"a pretty wife,  plenty ofmoney, and no sorrow or care.\"\\n  The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together tillthey rang again;

for with that fun the fourth generallybegan his career.\"\\nHe looked very  jovial, did little work, and hadthe more holidays.\"\\n\"If the world were only a little  more settled,\"said he: \"but sometimes I\\'m obliged to be in a good humor, andsometimes  a bad one, according to circumstances; now rain, nowsunshine.\"\\nI\\'m kind of a house  agent, also a manager of funerals.\"\\nI canlaugh or cry, according to circumstances.\"\\n I have my summer wardrobe inthis box here, but it would be very foolish to put it  on now.\"\\nHere Iam.\"\\nOn Sundays I go out walking in shoes and white silk stockings, anda  muff.\"\\n  After him, a lady stepped out of the coach.\"\\nShe called herselfMiss MAY.\"\\nShe wore a  summer dress and overshoes; her dress was a lightgreen, and she wore anemones in her  hair.\"\\nShe was so scented withwild-thyme, that it made the sentry sneeze.\"\\n \"Your health, and God bless you,\" was her salutation to him.\"\\n How pretty she was!\"\\nand such a singer!\"\\nnot a theatre singer, nor aballad singer; no,  but a singer of the woods; for she wandered throughthe gay green forest, and had a  concert there for her own amusement.\"\\n \"Now comes the young lady,\" said those in the carriage; and outstepped a young dame,  delicate, proud, and pretty.\"\\nIt was MistressJUNE, in whose service people become lazy  and fond of sleeping forhours.\"\\nShe gives a feast on the longest day of the year, that  theremay be time for her guests to partake of the numerous dishes at hertable.\"\\nIndeed,  she keeps her own carriage; but still she travelledby the mail, with the rest, because  she wished to show that she wasnot high-minded.\"\\nBut she was not without a protector;  her youngerbrother, JULY, was with her.\"\\nHe was a plump young fellow, clad insummer  garments and wearing a straw hat.\"\\nHe had but very littleluggage with him, because  it was so cumbersome in the great heat; hehad, however, swimming-trousers with him,  which are nothing tocarry.\"\\nThen came the mother herself, in crinoline, Madame AUGUST,  awholesale dealer in fruit, proprietress of a large number of fishponds and a land  cultivator.\"\\nShe was fat and heated, yet she could useher hands well, and would herself  carry out beer to the laborers inthe field.\"\\n\"In the sweat of the face shalt thou eat  bread,\" saidshe; \"it is written in the Bible.\"\\n After work, came the  recreations,dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the \"harvest homes.\"\\n She wasa  thorough housewife.\"\\n After her a man came out of the coach, who is a painter; he is thegreat master of  colors, and is named SEPTEMBER.\"\\nThe forest, on hisarrival, had to change its colors  when he wished it; and how beautifulare the colors he chooses!\"\\nThe woods glow with  hues of red and goldand brown.\"\\nThis great master painter could whistle like a  blackbird.He was quick in his work, and soon entwined the tendrils of the hopplant  around his beer jug.\"\\nThis was an ornament to the jug, and he hasa great love for  ornament.\"\\nThere he stood with his color pot in hishand, and that was the whole of  his luggage.\"\\nA land-owner followed,who in the month for sowing seed attended to the  ploughing and wasfond of field sports.\"\\nSquire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gunwith  him, and had nuts in his game bag.\"\\n\"Crack, crack.\"\\n He had a greatdeal of luggage,  even an English plough.\"\\nHe spoke of farming, but whathe said could scarcely be heard  for the coughing and gasping of hisneighbor.\"\\nIt was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently  as he got out.\"\\nHe hada cold, which caused him to use his pocket-handkerchief  continually;and yet he said he was obliged to accompany servant girls to their  newplaces, and initiate them into their winter service.\"\\nHe said hethought his cold  would never leave him when he went out woodcutting,for he was a master sawyer, and  had to supply wood to the wholeparish.\"\\nHe spent his evenings preparing wooden soles  for skates, forhe knew, he said, that in a few weeks these shoes would be wantedfor  the amusement of skating.\"\\nAt length the last passenger made herappearance,- old Mother  DECEMBER, with her fire-stool.\"\\nThe dame wasvery old, but her eyes glistened like two  stars.\"\\nShe carried on herarm a flower-pot, in which a little fir-tree was growing.\"\\n \"This tree Ishall guard and cherish,\" she said, \"that it may grow large byChristmas  Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be coveredand adorned with flaming  candles, golden apples, and little figures.The fire-stool will be as warm as a stove,  and I shall then bring astory book out of my pocket, and read aloud till all the  children inthe room are quite quiet.\"\\nThen the little figures on the tree willbecome  lively, and the little waxen angel at the top spread out hiswings of gold-leaf, and  fly down from his green perch.\"\\nHe will kissevery one in the room, great and small;  yes, even the poor childrenwho stand in the passage, or out in the street singing  a carol aboutthe \\'Star of Bethlehem.\\'\"  \"Well, now the coach may drive away,\" said the sentry; \"we havethe whole twelve.\"\\nLet  the horses be put up.\"\\n  \"First, let all the twelve come to me,\" said the captain onduty, \"one after another.\"\\n The passports I will keep here.\"\\nEach of themis available for one month; when that  has passed, I shall write thebehavior of each on his passport.\"\\nMr.\"\\nJANUARY, have the  goodness tocome here.\"\\n And Mr.\"\\nJanuary stepped forward.\"\\n When a year has passed, I think I shall be able to tell you whatthe twelve passengers  have brought to you, to me, and to all of us.Now I do not know, and probably even  they don\\'t know themselves, forwe live in strange times.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE MARSH KING\\'S DAUGHTER  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE storks relate to their little ones a great many stories, andthey are all about  moors and reed banks, and suited to their age andcapacity.\"\\nThe youngest of them are  quite satisfied with \"kribble,krabble,\" or such nonsense, and think it very grand;  but the elderones want something with a deeper meaning, or at least something  abouttheir own family.\"\\n We are only acquainted with one of the two longest and oldeststories which the storks  relate- it is about Moses, who was exposed byhis mother on the banks of the Nile,  and was found by the king\\'sdaughter, who gave him a good education, and he afterwards  became agreat man; but where he was buried is still unknown.\"\\n Every one knows this story, but not the second; very likelybecause it is quite an  inland story.\"\\nIt has been repeated from mouthto mouth, from one stork-mamma to another,  for thousands of years; andeach has told it better than the last; and now we mean  to tell itbetter than all.\"\\n The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it happened,and had their summer  residence on the rafters of the Viking\\'s house,which stood near the wild moorlands  of Wendsyssell; that is, tospeak more correctly, the great moorheath, high up in the  north ofJutland, by the Skjagen peak.\"\\nThis wilderness is still an immense wildheath  of marshy ground, about which we can read in the \"OfficialDirectory.\"\\n It is said that  in olden times the place was a lake, theground of which had heaved up from beneath,  and now the moorlandextends for miles in every direction, and is surrounded by  dampmeadows, trembling, undulating swamps, and marshy ground coveredwith turf, on  which grow bilberry bushes and stunted trees.\"\\nMistsare almost always hovering over  this region, which, seventy years ago,was overrun with wolves.\"\\nIt may well be called  the Wild Moor; andone can easily imagine, with such a wild expanse of marsh and  lake,how lonely and dreary it must have been a thousand years ago.\"\\nManythings may  be noticed now that existed then.\"\\nThe reeds grow to thesame height, and bear the same  kind of long, purple-brown leaves, withtheir feathery tips.\"\\nThere still stands the  birch, with its white barkand its delicate, loosely hanging leaves; and with regard  to theliving beings who frequented this spot, the fly still wears a gauzydress of  the same cut, and the favorite colors of the stork are white,with black and red for  stockings.\"\\nThe people, certainly, in thosedays, wore very different dresses to those  they now wear, but if anyof them, be he huntsman or squire, master or servant, ventured  onthe wavering, undulating, marshy ground of the moor, they met with thesame fate  a thousand years ago as they would now.\"\\nThe wanderer sank,and went down to the Marsh  King, as he is named, who rules in thegreat moorland empire beneath.\"\\nThey also called  him \"Gunkel King,\" butwe like the name of \"Marsh King\" better, and we will give him  thatname as the storks do.\"\\nVery little is known of the Marsh King\\'srule, but that,  perhaps, is a good thing.\"\\n In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the greatarm of the North Sea  and the Cattegat which is called theLumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with  its water-tight stonecellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys.\"\\nOn the  ridgeof the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the stork-mammasat on her  eggs and felt sure her hatching would come to something.\"\\n One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when he camehome he seemed quite  busy, bustling, and important.\"\\n\"I havesomething very dreadful to tell you,\" said he  to the stork-mamma.\"\\n \"Keep it to yourself then,\" she replied.\"\\n\"Remember that I amhatching eggs; it may  agitate me, and will affect them.\"\\n  \"You must know it at once,\" said he.\"\\n\"The daughter of our hostin Egypt has arrived  here.\"\\nShe has ventured to take this journey,and now she is lost.\"\\n  \"She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?\"\\n cried themother stork.\"\\n\"Oh,  tell me all about it; you know I cannot bear tobe kept waiting at a time when I am  hatching eggs.\"\\n  \"Well, you see, mother,\" he replied, \"she believed what thedoctors said, and what  I have heard you state also, that themoor-flowers which grow about here would heal  her sick father; and shehas flown to the north in swan\\'s plumage, in company with  some otherswan-princesses, who come to these parts every year to renew theiryouth.\"\\n She came, and where is she now!\"\\n  \"You enter into particulars too much,\" said the mamma stork,\"and the eggs may take  cold; I cannot bear such suspense as this.\"\\n  \"Well,\" said he, \"I have kept watch; and this evening I went amongthe rushes where  I thought the marshy ground would bear me, andwhile I was there three swans came.\"\\n Something in their manner offlying seemed to say to me, \\'Look carefully now; there  is one notall swan, only swan\\'s feathers.\\' You know, mother, you have the  sameintuitive feeling that I have; you know whether a thing is right ornot  immediately.\"\\n  \"Yes, of course,\" said she; \"but tell me about the princess; Iam tired of hearing  about the swan\\'s feathers.\"\\n  \"Well, you know that in the middle of the moor there issomething like a lake,\" said  the stork-papa.\"\\n\"You can see the edgeof it if you raise yourself a little.\"\\nJust there,  by the reeds and thegreen banks, lay the trunk of an elder-tree; upon this the three  swansstood flapping their wings, and looking about them; one of themthrew off her  plumage, and I immediately recognized her as one ofthe princesses of our home in Egypt.\"\\n There she sat, without anycovering but her long, black hair.\"\\nI heard her tell the  two othersto take great care of the swan\\'s plumage, while she dipped down intothe  water to pluck the flowers which she fancied she saw there.\"\\nTheothers nodded, and  picked up the feather dress, and took possession ofit.\"\\nI wonder what will become of  it?\"\\nthought I, and she most likelyasked herself the same question.\"\\nIf so, she received  an answer, a verypractical one; for the two swans rose up and flew away with her  swan\\'splumage.\"\\n\\'Dive down now!\\' they cried; \\'thou shalt never more fly inthe swan\\'s  plumage, thou shalt never again see Egypt; here, on themoor, thou wilt remain.\\' So  saying, they tore the swan\\'s plumageinto a thousand pieces, the feathers drifted about  like a snow-shower,and then the two deceitful princesses flew away.\"\\n  \"Why, that is terrible,\" said the stork-mamma; \"I feel as if Icould hardly bear to  hear any more, but you must tell me what happenednext.\"\\n  \"The princess wept and lamented aloud; her tears moistened theelder stump, which was  really not an elder stump but the Marsh Kinghimself, he who in marshy ground lives  and rules.\"\\nI saw myself how thestump of the tree turned round, and was a tree no more,  while long,clammy branches like arms, were extended from it.\"\\nThen the poorchild was  terribly frightened, and started up to run away.\"\\nShehastened to cross the green, slimy  ground; but it will not bear anyweight, much less hers.\"\\nShe quickly sank, and the  elder stump divedimmediately after her; in fact, it was he who drew her down.\"\\n Greatblack bubbles rose up out of the moor-slime, and with these everytrace of the  two vanished.\"\\nAnd now the princess is buried in thewild marsh, she will never now  carry flowers to Egypt to cure herfather.\"\\nIt would have broken your heart, mother,  had you seen it.\"\\n  \"You ought not to have told me,\" said she, \"at such a time asthis; the eggs might  suffer.\"\\nBut I think the princess will soon findhelp; some one will rise up to help  her.\"\\nAh!\"\\nif it had been you orI, or one of our people, it would have been all over  with us.\"\\n  I mean to go every day,\" said he, \"to see if anything comes topass;\" and so he did.\"\\n A long time went by, but at last he saw a green stalk shootingup out of the deep,  marshy ground.\"\\nAs it reached the surface of themarsh, a leaf spread out, and unfolded  itself broader and broader, andclose to it came forth a bud.\"\\n One morning, when the stork-papa was flying over the stem, hesaw that the power of  the sun\\'s rays had caused the bud to open, andin the cup of the flower lay a charming  child- a little maiden,looking as if she had just come out of a bath.\"\\nThe little one  was solike the Egyptian princess, that the stork, at the first moment,thought it must  be the princess herself, but after a little reflectionhe decided that it was much  more likely to be the daughter of theprincess and the Marsh King; and this explained  also her beingplaced in the cup of a water-lily.\"\\n\"But she cannot be left to liehere,\"  thought the stork, \"and in my nest there are already so many.But stay, I have thought  of something: the wife of the Viking has nochildren, and how often she has wished  for a little one.\"\\nPeople alwayssay the stork brings the little ones; I will do so  in earnest thistime.\"\\nI shall fly with the child to the Viking\\'s wife; whatrejoicing  there will be!\"\\n  And then the stork lifted the little girl out of the flower-cup,flew to the castle,  picked a hole with his beak in thebladder-covered, window, and laid the beautiful  child in the bosomof the Viking\\'s wife.\"\\nThen he flew back quickly to the stork-mamma  andtold her what he had seen and done; and the little storks listenedto it all, for  they were then quite old enough to do so.\"\\n\"So you see,\"he continued, \"that the princess  is not dead, for she must have senther little one up here; and now I have found a  home for her.\"\\n  \"Ah, I said it would be so from the first,\" replied thestork-mamma; \"but now think  a little of your own family.\"\\nOurtravelling time draws near, and I sometimes feel a  little irritationalready under the wings.\"\\nThe cuckoos and the nightingale are  alreadygone, and I heard the quails say they should go too as soon as thewind was  favorable.\"\\nOur youngsters will go through all themanoeuvres at the review very well,  or I am much mistaken in them.\"\\n  The Viking\\'s wife was above measure delighted when she awoke thenext morning and found  the beautiful little child lying in herbosom.\"\\nShe kissed it and caressed it; but it  cried terribly, andstruck out with its arms and legs, and did not seem to be pleased  atall.\"\\nAt last it cried itself to sleep; and as it lay there so stilland quiet, it  was a most beautiful sight to see.\"\\nThe Viking\\'s wife wasso delighted, that body and  soul were full of joy.\"\\nHer heart felt solight within her, that it seemed as if her  husband and his soldiers,who were absent, must come home as suddenly and unexpectedly  as thelittle child had done.\"\\nShe and her whole household therefore busiedthemselves  in preparing everything for the reception of her lord.The long, colored tapestry,  on which she and her maidens had workedpictures of their idols, Odin, Thor, and Friga,  was hung up.\"\\nTheslaves polished the old shields that served as ornaments; cushionswere  placed on the seats, and dry wood laid on the fireplaces in thecentre of the hall,  so that the flames might be fanned up at amoment\\'s notice.\"\\nThe Viking\\'s wife herself  assisted in the work, sothat at night she felt very tired, and quickly fell into a  soundsleep.\"\\nWhen she awoke, just before morning, she was terribly alarmedto find that  the infant had vanished.\"\\nShe sprang from her couch,lighted a pine-chip, and searched  all round the room, when, at last,in that part of the bed where her feet had been,  lay, not the child,but a great, ugly frog.\"\\nShe was quite disgusted at this sight,  andseized a heavy stick to kill the frog; but the creature looked ather with such  strange, mournful eyes, that she was unable to strikethe blow.\"\\nOnce more she searched  round the room; then she started athearing the frog utter a low, painful croak.\"\\nShe  sprang from the couchand opened the window hastily; at the same moment the sun rose,  andthrew its beams through the window, till it rested on the couchwhere the great  frog lay.\"\\nSuddenly it appeared as if the frog\\'sbroad mouth contracted, and became  small and red.\"\\nThe limbs movedand stretched out and extended themselves till they  took a beautifulshape; and behold there was the pretty child lying before her, and  theugly frog was gone.\"\\n\"How is this?\"\\n she cried, \"have I had a wickeddream?\"\\nIs it  not my own lovely cherub that lies there.\"\\n Then shekissed it and fondled it; but the  child struggled and fought, andbit as if she had been a little wild cat.\"\\n The Viking did not return on that day, nor the next; he was,however, on the way home;  but the wind, so favorable to the storks,was against him; for it blew towards the  south.\"\\nA wind in favor of oneis often against another.\"\\n After two or three days had passed, it became clear to theViking\\'s wife how matters  stood with the child; it was under theinfluence of a powerful sorcerer.\"\\nBy day it  was charming in appearanceas an angel of light, but with a temper wicked and wild;  while atnight, in the form of an ugly frog, it was quiet and mournful, witheyes full  of sorrow.\"\\nHere were two natures, changing inwardly andoutwardly with the absence  and return of sunlight.\"\\nAnd so ithappened that by day the child, with the actual form  of its mother,possessed the fierce disposition of its father; at night, on thecontrary,  its outward appearance plainly showed its descent on thefather\\'s side, while inwardly  it had the heart and mind of its mother.Who would be able to loosen this wicked charm  which the sorcerer hadworked upon it?\"\\nThe wife of the Viking lived in constant pain  andsorrow about it.\"\\nHer heart clung to the little creature, but she couldnot explain  to her husband the circumstances in which it was placed.He was expected to return  shortly; and were she to tell him, hewould very likely, as was the custom at that  time, expose the poorchild in the public highway, and let any one take it away who  would.The good wife of the Viking could not let that happen, and shetherefore resolved  that the Viking should never see the childexcepting by daylight.\"\\n One morning there sounded a rushing of storks\\' wings over theroof.\"\\nMore than a hundred  pair of storks had rested there during thenight, to recover themselves after their  excursion; and now theysoared aloft, and prepared for the journey southward.\"\\n \"All the husbands are here, and ready!\"\\n they cried; \"wives andchildren also!\"\\n  \"How light we are!\"\\n screamed the young storks in chorus.\"\\nSomething pleasant seems  creeping over us, even down to our toes,as if we were full of live frogs.\"\\nAh, how  delightful it is to travelinto foreign lands!\"\\n  \"Hold yourselves properly in the line with us,\" cried papa andmamma.\"\\n\"Do not use your  beaks so much; it tries the lungs.\"\\n And thenthe storks flew away.\"\\n About the same time sounded the clang of the warriors\\' trumpetsacross the heath.\"\\nThe  Viking had landed with his men.\"\\nThey werereturning home, richly laden with spoil from  the Gallic coast, wherethe people, as did also the inhabitants of Britain, often cried  inalarm, \"Deliver us from the wild northmen.\"\\n  Life and noisy pleasure came with them into the castle of theViking on the moorland.\"\\n A great cask of mead was drawn into thehall, piles of wood blazed, cattle were slain  and served up, that theymight feast in reality, The priest who offered the sacrifice  sprinkledthe devoted parishioners with the warm blood; the fire crackled, andthe  smoke rolled along beneath the roof; the soot fell upon themfrom the beams; but they  were used to all these things.\"\\nGuests wereinvited, and received handsome presents.\"\\n All wrongs and unfaithfulnesswere forgotten.\"\\nThey drank deeply, and threw in each  other\\'s faces thebones that were left, which was looked upon as a sign of goodfeeling  amongst them.\"\\nA bard, who was a kind of musician as well aswarrior, and who had been  with the Viking in his expedition, andknew what to sing about, gave them one of his  best songs, in whichthey heard all their warlike deeds praised, and every wonderful  actionbrought forward with honor.\"\\nEvery verse ended with this refrain,-  \"Gold and possessions will flee away,  Friends and foes must die one day;  Every man on earth must die,  But a famous name will never die.\"\\nAnd with that they beat upon their shields, and  hammered upon thetable with knives and bones, in a most outrageous manner.\"\\n The Viking\\'s wife sat upon a raised cross seat in the open hall.She wore a silk dress,  golden bracelets, and large amber beads.\"\\nShewas in costly attire, and the bard named  her in his song, and spoke ofthe rich treasure of gold which she had brought to her  husband.\"\\nHerhusband had already seen the wonderfully beautiful child in thedaytime,  and was delighted with her beauty; even her wild ways pleasedhim.\"\\nHe said the little  maiden would grow up to be a heroine, with thestrong will and determination of a man.\"\\n She would never wink her eyes,even if, in joke, an expert hand should attempt to cut  off hereye-brows with a sharp sword.\"\\n The full cask of mead soon became empty, and a fresh one wasbrought in; for these  were people who liked plenty to eat and drink.The old proverb, which every one knows,  says that \"the cattle knowwhen to leave their pasture, but a foolish man knows not  the measureof his own appetite.\"\\n Yes, they all knew this; but men may know whatis  right, and yet often do wrong.\"\\nThey also knew \"that even thewelcome guest becomes  wearisome when he sits too long in the house.\"\\nBut there they remained; for pork and  mead are good things.\"\\nAnd soat the Viking\\'s house they stayed, and enjoyed themselves;  and atnight the bondmen slept in the ashes, and dipped their fingers inthe fat, and  licked them.\"\\nOh, it was a delightful time!\"\\n Once more in the same year the Viking went forth, though thestorms of autumn had  already commenced to roar.\"\\nHe went with hiswarriors to the coast of Britain; he said  that it was but an excursionof pleasure across the water, so his wife remained at  home with thelittle girl.\"\\nAfter a while, it is quite certain the foster-motherbegan  to love the poor frog, with its gentle eyes and its deepsighs, even better than the  little beauty who bit and fought withall around her.\"\\n The heavy, damp mists of autumn, which destroy the leaves of thewood, had already  fallen upon forest and heath.\"\\nFeathers of pluckedbirds, as they call the snow, flew  about in thick showers, andwinter was coming.\"\\nThe sparrows took possession of the  stork\\'s nest,and conversed about the absent owners in their own fashion; andthey,  the stork pair and all their young ones, where were they stayingnow?\"\\nThe storks might  have been found in the land of Egypt, wherethe sun\\'s rays shone forth bright and warm,  as it does here atmidsummer.\"\\nTamarinds and acacias were in full bloom all over  thecountry, the crescent of Mahomet glittered brightly from the cupolasof the mosques,  and on the slender pinnacles sat many of the storks,resting after their long journey.\"\\n Swarms of them took dividedpossession of the nests- nests which lay close to each  other betweenthe venerable columns, and crowded the arches of temples inforgotten  cities.\"\\nThe date and the palm lifted themselves as ascreen or as a sun-shade over  them.\"\\nThe gray pyramids looked likebroken shadows in the clear air and the far-off  desert, where theostrich wheels his rapid flight, and the lion, with his subtle  eyes,gazes at the marble sphinx which lies half buried in sand.\"\\nThewaters of the Nile  had retreated, and the whole bed of the river wascovered with frogs, which was a most  acceptable prospect for the storkfamilies.\"\\nThe young storks thought their eyes  deceived them,everything around appeared so beautiful.\"\\n \"It is always like this here, and this is how we live in ourwarm country,\" said the  stork-mamma; and the thought made the youngones almost beside themselves with  pleasure.\"\\n \"Is there anything more to see?\"\\n they asked; \"are we going fartherinto the country?\"\\n  \"There is nothing further for us to see,\" answered thestork-mamma.\"\\n\"Beyond this  delightful region there are immense forests,where the branches of the trees entwine  round each other, whileprickly, creeping plants cover the paths, and only an elephant  couldforce a passage for himself with his great feet.\"\\nThe snakes are toolarge, and  the lizards too lively for us to catch.\"\\nThen there is thedesert; if you went there,  your eyes would soon be full of sand withthe lightest breeze, and if it should blow  great guns, you wouldmost likely find yourself in a sand-drift.\"\\nHere is the best  placefor you, where there are frogs and locusts; here I shall remain, andso must you.\"\\n  And so they stayed.\"\\n The parents sat in the nest on the slender minaret, and rested,yet still were busily  employed in cleaning and smoothing theirfeathers, and in sharpening their beaks  against their red stockings;then they would stretch out their necks, salute each other,  andgravely raise their heads with the high-polished forehead, and soft,smooth  feathers, while their brown eyes shone with intelligence.\"\\nThefemale young ones  strutted about amid the moist rushes, glancing atthe other young storks and making  acquaintances, and swallowing a frogat every third step, or tossing a little snake  about with their beaks,in a way they considered very becoming, and besides it tasted  verygood.\"\\nThe young male storks soon began to quarrel; they struck at eachother with  their wings, and pecked with their beaks till the bloodcame.\"\\nAnd in this manner many  of the young ladies and gentlemen werebetrothed to each other: it was, of course,  what they wanted, andindeed what they lived for.\"\\nThen they returned to a nest, and  therethe quarrelling began afresh; for in hot countries people are almostall violent  and passionate.\"\\nBut for all that it was pleasant,especially for the old people, who  watched them with great joy: allthat their young ones did suited them.\"\\nEvery day here  there wassunshine, plenty to eat, and nothing to think of but pleasure.\"\\nButin the  rich castle of their Egyptian host, as they called him,pleasure was not to be found.\"\\n The rich and mighty lord of the castlelay on his couch, in the midst of the great  hall, with its manycolored walls looking like the centre of a great tulip; but he  wasstiff and powerless in all his limbs, and lay stretched out like amummy.\"\\nHis family  and servants stood round him; he was not dead,although he could scarcely be said to  live.\"\\nThe healing moor-flowerfrom the north, which was to have been found and brought  to him by herwho loved him so well, had not arrived.\"\\nHis young and beautifuldaughter  who, in swan\\'s plumage, had flown over land and seas to thedistant north, had never  returned.\"\\nShe is dead, so the twoswan-maidens had said when they came home; and they  made up quite astory about her, and this is what they told,-  \"We three flew away together through the air,\" said they: \"ahunter caught sight of  us, and shot at us with an arrow.\"\\nThe arrowstruck our young friend and sister, and  slowly singing her farewellsong she sank down, a dying swan, into the forest lake.\"\\n On theshores of the lake, under a spreading birch-tree, we laid her in thecold earth.\"\\n We had our revenge; we bound fire under the wings of aswallow, who had a nest on the  thatched roof of the huntsman.\"\\nThehouse took fire, and burst into flames; the hunter  was burnt withthe house, and the light was reflected over the sea as far as  thespreading birch, beneath which we laid her sleeping dust.\"\\nShe willnever return  to the land of Egypt.\"\\n And then they both wept.\"\\nAndstork-papa, who heard the story,  snapped with his beak so that itmight be heard a long way off.\"\\n \\'Deceit and lies!\"\\n cried he; \"I should like to run my beak deepinto their chests.\"\\n  \"And perhaps break it off,\" said the mamma stork, \"then what asight you would be.\"\\n Think first of yourself, and then of yourfamily; all others are nothing to us.\"\\n  \"Yes, I know,\" said the stork-papa; \"but to-morrow I can easilyplace myself on the  edge of the open cupola, when the learned and wisemen assemble to consult on the state  of the sick man; perhaps they maycome a little nearer to the truth.\"\\n And the learned  and wise menassembled together, and talked a great deal on every point; but thestork  could make no sense out of anything they said; neither werethere any good results  from their consultations, either for the sickman, or for his daughter in the marshy  heath.\"\\nWhen we listen to whatpeople say in this world, we shall hear a great deal;  but it is anadvantage to know what has been said and done before, when we listento  a conversation.\"\\nThe stork did, and we know at least as much ashe, the stork.\"\\n \"Love is a life-giver.\"\\nThe highest love produces the highest life.Only through love  can the sick man be cured.\"\\n This had been said bymany, and even the learned men  acknowledged that it was a wise saying.\"\\n \"What a beautiful thought!\"\\n exclaimed the papa stork immediately.\"\\n \"I don\\'t quite understand it,\" said the mamma stork, when herhusband repeated it;  \"however, it is not my fault, but the fault ofthe thought; whatever it may be, I have  something else to think of.\"\\n  Now the learned men had spoken also of love between this one andthat one; of the  difference of the love which we have for ourneighbor, to the love that exists between  parents and children; of thelove of the plant for the light, and how the germ springs  forth whenthe sunbeam kisses the ground.\"\\nAll these things were so elaboratelyand  learnedly explained, that it was impossible for stork-papa tofollow it, much less  to talk about it.\"\\nHis thoughts on the subjectquite weighed him down; he stood the  whole of the following day on oneleg, with half-shut eyes, thinking deeply.\"\\nSo much  learning wasquite a heavy weight for him to carry.\"\\nOne thing, however, the papastork  could understand.\"\\nEvery one, high and low, had from their inmosthearts expressed their  opinion that it was a great misfortune for somany thousands of people- the whole  country indeed- to have this manso sick, with no hopes of his recovery.\"\\nAnd what joy  and blessing itwould spread around if he could by any means be cured!\"\\nBut wherebloomed  the flower that could bring him health?\"\\nThey had searchedfor it everywhere; in learned  writings, in the shining stars, in theweather and wind.\"\\nInquiries had been made in  every by-way that couldbe thought of, until at last the wise and learned men has  asserted, aswe have been already told, that \"love, the life-giver, could alonegive  new life to a father;\" and in saying this, they had overdoneit, and said more than  they understood themselves.\"\\nThey repeated it,and wrote it down as a recipe, \"Love  is a life-giver.\"\\n But how couldsuch a recipe be prepared- that was a difficulty they  could notovercome.\"\\nAt last it was decided that help could only come from theprincess  herself, whose whole soul was wrapped up in her father,especially as a plan had been  adopted by her to enable her to obtain aremedy.\"\\n More than a year had passed since the princess had set out atnight, when the light  of the young moon was soon lost beneath thehorizon.\"\\nShe had gone to the marble sphinx  in the desert, shakingthe sand from her sandals, and then passed through the long  passage,which leads to the centre of one of the great pyramids, where themighty kings  of antiquity, surrounded with pomp and splendor, lieveiled in the form of mummies.\"\\n She had been told by the wise men, thatif she laid her head on the breast of one of  them, from the head shewould learn where to find life and recovery for her father.\"\\n She hadperformed all this, and in a dream had learnt that she must bring hometo her  father the lotus flower, which grows in the deep sea, nearthe moors and heath in the  Danish land.\"\\nThe very place and situationhad been pointed out to her, and she was  told that the flower wouldrestore her father to health and strength.\"\\nAnd, therefore,  she hadgone forth from the land of Egypt, flying over to the open marsh andthe wild  moor in the plumage of a swan.\"\\n The papa and mamma storks knew all this, and we also know itnow.\"\\nWe know, too, that  the Marsh King has drawn her down tohimself, and that to the loved ones at home she  is forever dead.\"\\nOneof the wisest of them said, as the stork-mamma also said, \"That  insome way she would, after all, manage to succeed;\" and so at last theycomforted  themselves with this hope, and would wait patiently; infact, they could do nothing  better.\"\\n \"I should like to get away the swan\\'s feathers from those twotreacherous princesses,\"  said the papa stork; \"then, at least, theywould not be able to fly over again to the  wild moor, and do morewickedness.\"\\nI can hide the two suits of feathers over yonder,  tillwe find some use for them.\"\\n  \"But where will you put them?\"\\n asked the mamma stork.\"\\n \"In our nest on the moor.\"\\nI and the young ones will carry themby turns during our  flight across; and as we return, should they provetoo heavy for us, we shall be sure  to find plenty of places on the wayin which we can conceal them till our next journey.\"\\n Certainly one suitof swan\\'s feathers would be enough for the princess, but two  arealways better.\"\\nIn those northern countries no one can have too manytravelling  wrappers.\"\\n  \"No one will thank you for it,\" said stork-mamma; \"but you aremaster; and, excepting  at breeding time, I have nothing to say.\"\\n  In the Viking\\'s castle on the wild moor, to which the storksdirected their flight  in the following spring, the little maiden stillremained.\"\\nThey had named her Helga,  which was rather too soft a namefor a child with a temper like hers, although her  form was stillbeautiful.\"\\nEvery month this temper showed itself in sharperoutlines;  and in the course of years, while the storks still madethe same journeys in autumn  to the hill, and in spring to the moors,the child grew to be almost a woman, and before  any one seemed awareof it, she was a wonderfully beautiful maiden of sixteen.\"\\nThe  casketwas splendid, but the contents were worthless.\"\\nShe was, indeed, wildand savage  even in those hard, uncultivated times.\"\\nIt was a pleasureto her to splash about with  her white hands in the warm blood of thehorse which had been slain for sacrifice.\"\\n In one of her wild moods shebit off the head of the black cock, which the priest was  about to slayfor the sacrifice.\"\\nTo her foster-father she said one day, \"If thineenemy  were to pull down thine house about thy ears, and thou shouldestbe sleeping in  unconscious security, I would not wake thee; even ifI had the power I would never  do it, for my ears still tingle with theblow that thou gavest me years ago.\"\\nI have  never forgotten it.\"\\n Butthe Viking treated her words as a joke; he was, like every  one else,bewitched with her beauty, and knew nothing of the change in theform and  temper of Helga at night.\"\\nWithout a saddle, she would siton a horse as if she were  a part of it, while it rushed along atfull speed; nor would she spring from its back,  even when itquarrelled with other horses and bit them.\"\\nShe would often leap fromthe  high shore into the sea with all her clothes on, and swim tomeet the Viking, when  his boat was steering home towards the shore.She once cut off a long lock of her  beautiful hair, and twisted itinto a string for her bow.\"\\n\"If a thing is to be done  well,\" saidshe, \"I must do it myself.\"\\n The Viking\\'s wife was, for the time in which she lived, a woman ofstrong character  and will; but, compared to her daughter, she was agentle, timid woman, and she knew  that a wicked sorcerer had theterrible child in his power.\"\\nIt was sometimes as if  Helga acted fromsheer wickedness; for often when her mother stood on the thresholdof  the door, or stepped into the yard, she would seat herself on thebrink of the well,  wave her arms and legs in the air, and suddenlyfall right in.\"\\nHere she was able, from  her frog nature, to dip anddive about in the water of the deep well, until at last  she wouldclimb forth like a cat, and come back into the hall dripping withwater, so  that the green leaves that were strewed on the floor werewhirled round, and carried  away by the streams that flowed from her.\"\\n But there was one time of the day which placed a check upon Helga.It was the evening  twilight; when this hour arrived she became quietand thoughtful, and allowed herself  to be advised and led; then also asecret feeling seemed to draw her towards her mother.\"\\n And as usual,when the sun set, and the transformation took place, both in bodyand  mind, inwards and outwards, she would remain quiet and mournful,with her form shrunk  together in the shape of a frog.\"\\nHer body wasmuch larger than those animals ever are,  and on this account it wasmuch more hideous in appearance; for she looked like a  wretched dwarf,with a frog\\'s head, and webbed fingers.\"\\nHer eyes had a most  piteousexpression; she was without a voice, excepting a hollow, croakingsound, like  the smothered sobs of a dreaming child.\"\\n Then the Viking\\'s wife took her on her lap, and forgot the uglyform, as she looked  into the mournful eyes, and often said, \"I couldwish that thou wouldst always remain  my dumb frog child, for thouart too terrible when thou art clothed in a form of beauty.\"\\n  And theViking woman wrote Runic characters against sorcery and spells ofsickness,  and threw them over the wretched child; but they did nogood.\"\\n \"One can scarcely believe that she was ever small enough to lie inthe cup of the  water-lily,\" said the papa stork; \"and now she is grownup, and the image of her  Egyptian mother, especially about the eyes.Ah, we shall never see her again; perhaps  she has not discovered howto help herself, as you and the wise men said she would.\"\\n Year afteryear have I flown across and across the moor, but there was no sign ofher  being still alive.\"\\nYes, and I may as well tell you that you thateach year, when I  arrived a few days before you to repair the nest,and put everything in its place,  I have spent a whole night flyinghere and there over the marshy lake, as if I had  been an owl or a bat,but all to no purpose.\"\\nThe two suit of swan\\'s plumage, which  I and theyoung ones dragged over here from the land of the Nile, are of no use;trouble  enough it was to us to bring them here in three journeys,and now they are lying at  the bottom of the nest; and if a fire shouldhappen to break out, and the wooden house  be burnt down, they would bedestroyed.\"\\n  \"And our good nest would be destroyed, too,\" said the mamma stork;\"but you think less  of that than of your plumage stuff and yourmoor-princess.\"\\nGo and stay with her in  the marsh if you like.\"\\nYouare a bad father to your own children, as I have told you  already,when I hatched my first brood.\"\\nI only hope neither we nor our childrenmay  have an arrow sent through our wings, owing to that wild girl.Helga does not know  in the least what she is about.\"\\nWe have lived inthis house longer than she has, she  should think of that, and wehave never forgotten our duty.\"\\nWe have paid every year  our toll of afeather, an egg, and a young one, as it is only right we should do.You  don\\'t suppose I can wander about the court-yard, or goeverywhere as I used to do in  old times.\"\\nI can do it in Egypt, where Ican be a companion of the people, without  forgetting myself.\"\\nButhere I cannot go and peep into the pots and kettles as I do  there.\"\\nNo,I can only sit up here and feel angry with that girl, the littlewretch;  and I am angry with you, too; you should have left her lyingin the water lily, then  no one would have known anything about her.\"\\n  \"You are far better than your conversation,\" said the papastork; \"I know you better  than you know yourself.\"\\n And with that hegave a hop, and flapped his wings twice,  proudly; then he stretchedhis neck and flew, or rather soared away, without moving  his outspreadwings.\"\\nHe went on for some distance, and then he gave a great flapwith  his wings and flew on his course at a rapid rate, his head andneck bending proudly  before him, while the sun\\'s rays fell on hisglossy plumage.\"\\n \"He is the handsomest of them all,\" said the mamma stork, as shewatched him; \"but  I won\\'t tell him so.\"\\n  Early in the autumn, the Viking again returned home laden withspoil, and bringing  prisoners with him.\"\\nAmong them was a youngChristian priest, one of those who contemned  the gods of the north.Often lately there had been, both in hall and chamber, a talk  of thenew faith which was spreading far and wide in the south, and which,through the  means of the holy Ansgarius, had already reached as far asHedeby on the Schlei.\"\\nEven  Helga had heard of this belief in theteachings of One who was named Christ, and who  for the love ofmankind, and for their redemption, had given up His life.\"\\nBut to herall  this had, as it were, gone in one ear and out the other.\"\\nIt seemedthat she only  understood the meaning of the word \"love,\" when in theform of a miserable frog she  crouched together in the corner of thesleeping chamber; but the Viking\\'s wife had  listened to thewonderful story, and had felt herself strangely moved by it.\"\\n On their return, after this voyage, the men spoke of the beautifultemples built of  polished stone, which had been raised for thepublic worship of this holy love.\"\\nSome  vessels, curiously formed ofmassive gold, had been brought home among the booty.\"\\nThere  was apeculiar fragrance about them all, for they were incense vessels,which had been  swung before the altars in the temples by the Christianpriests.\"\\nIn the deep stony  cellars of the castle, the youngChristian priest was immured, and his hands and feet  tied togetherwith strips of bark.\"\\nThe Viking\\'s wife considered him as beautifulas  Baldur, and his distress raised her pity; but Helga said he oughtto have ropes fastened  to his heels, and be tied to the tails ofwild animals.\"\\n \"I would let the dogs loose after him\" she said; \"over the moorand across the heath.\"\\n Hurrah!\"\\nthat would be a spectacle for thegods, and better still to follow in its  course.\"\\n  But the Viking would not allow him to die such a death as that,especially as he was  the disowned and despiser of the high gods.\"\\nIna few days, he had decided to have him  offered as a sacrifice on theblood-stone in the grove.\"\\nFor the first time, a man was  to besacrificed here.\"\\nHelga begged to be allowed to sprinkle theassembled people with  the blood of the priest.\"\\nShe sharpened herglittering knife; and when one of the great,  savage dogs, who wererunning about the Viking\\'s castle in great numbers, sprang  towardsher, she thrust the knife into his side, merely, as she said, to proveits  sharpness.\"\\n The Viking\\'s wife looked at the wild, badly disposed girl, withgreat sorrow; and when  night came on, and her daughter\\'s beautifulform and disposition were changed, she  spoke in eloquent words toHelga of the sorrow and deep grief that was in her heart.\"\\n The uglyfrog, in its monstrous shape, stood before her, and raised its brownmournful  eyes to her face, listening to her words, and seeming tounderstand them with the  intelligence of a human being.\"\\n \"Never once to my lord and husband has a word passed my lips ofwhat I have to suffer  through you; my heart is full of grief aboutyou,\" said the Viking\\'s wife.\"\\n\"The love  of a mother is greater andmore powerful than I ever imagined.\"\\nBut love never entered  thyheart; it is cold and clammy, like the plants on the moor.\"\\n  Then the miserable form trembled; it was as if these words hadtouched an invisible  bond between body and soul, for great tears stoodin the eyes.\"\\n \"A bitter time will come for thee at last,\" continued the Viking\\'swife; \"and it will  be terrible for me too.\"\\nIt had been better for theeif thou hadst been left on the  high-road, with the cold night windto lull thee to sleep.\"\\n And the Viking\\'s wife shed  bitter tears, andwent away in anger and sorrow, passing under the partition of  furs,which hung loose over the beam and divided the hall.\"\\n The shrivelled frog still sat in the corner alone.\"\\nDeep silencereigned around.\"\\nAt  intervals, a half-stifled sigh was heard from itsinmost soul; it was the soul of Helga.\"\\n It seemed in pain, as if anew life were arising in her heart.\"\\nThen she took a step  forward andlistened; then stepped again forward, and seized with her clumsy handsthe  heavy bar which was laid across the door.\"\\nGently, and with muchtrouble, she pushed  back the bar, as silently lifted the latch, andthen took up the glimmering lamp which  stood in the ante-chamber ofthe hall.\"\\nIt seemed as if a stronger will than her own  gave herstrength.\"\\nShe removed the iron bolt from the closed cellar-door, andslipped  in to the prisoner.\"\\nHe was slumbering.\"\\nShe touched him withher cold, moist hand, and  as he awoke and caught sight of thehideous form, he shuddered as if he beheld a wicked  apparition.\"\\nShedrew her knife, cut through the bonds which confined his hands andfeet,  and beckoned to him to follow her.\"\\nHe uttered some holy namesand made the sign of  the cross, while the form remained motionlessby his side.\"\\n \"Who art thou?\"\\n he asked, \"whose outward appearance is that ofan animal, while thou  willingly performest acts of mercy?\"\\n  The frog-figure beckoned to him to follow her, and led him througha long gallery  concealed by hanging drapery to the stables, and thenpointed to a horse.\"\\nHe mounted  upon it, and she sprang up alsobefore him, and held tightly by the animal\\'s mane.\"\\n The prisonerunderstood her, and they rode on at a rapid trot, by a road which hewould  never have found by himself, across the open heath.\"\\nHe forgother ugly form, and only  thought how the mercy and loving-kindness ofthe Almighty was acting through this  hideous apparition.\"\\nAs he offeredpious prayers and sang holy songs of praise, she  trembled.\"\\nWas itthe effect of prayer and praise that caused this?\"\\nor, was  sheshuddering in the cold morning air at the thought of approachingtwilight?\"\\nWhat  were her feelings?\"\\nShe raised herself up, and wanted tostop the horse and spring off,  but the Christian priest held herback with all his might, and then sang a pious song,  as if thiscould loosen the wicked charm that had changed her into thesemblance of  a frog.\"\\n And the horse galloped on more wildly than before.\"\\nThe sky painteditself red, the  first sunbeam pierced through the clouds, and in theclear flood of sunlight the frog  became changed.\"\\nIt was Helga again,young and beautiful, but with a wicked demoniac  spirit.\"\\nHe held nowa beautiful young woman in his arms, and he was horrified at  thesight.\"\\nHe stopped the horse, and sprang from its back.\"\\nHe imaginedthat some new  sorcery was at work.\"\\nBut Helga also leaped from thehorse and stood on the ground.\"\\n The child\\'s short garment reachedonly to her knee.\"\\nShe snatched the sharp knife from  her girdle, andrushed like lightning at the astonished priest.\"\\n\"Let me get atthee!\"\\n  she cried; \"let me get at thee, that I may plunge this knifeinto thy body.\"\\nThou art  pale as ashes, thou beardless slave.\"\\n Shepressed in upon him.\"\\nThey struggled with  each other in heavy combat,but it was as if an invisible power had been given to the  Christian inthe struggle.\"\\nHe held her fast, and the old oak under which they  stoodseemed to help him, for the loosened roots on the ground becameentangled in the  maiden\\'s feet, and held them fast.\"\\nClose by rose abubbling spring, and he sprinkled  Helga\\'s face and neck with thewater, commanded the unclean spirit to come forth, and  pronounced uponher a Christian blessing.\"\\nBut the water of faith has no power unlessthe  well-spring of faith flows within.\"\\nAnd yet even here its power wasshown; something  more than the mere strength of a man opposeditself, through his means, against the  evil which struggled withinher.\"\\nHis holy action seemed to overpower her.\"\\nShe dropped  her arms,glanced at him with pale cheeks and looks of amazement.\"\\nHe appeared toher  a mighty magician skilled in secret arts; his language was thedarkest magic to her,  and the movements of his hands in the air wereas the secret signs of a magician\\'s  wand.\"\\nShe would not have blinkedhad he waved over her head a sharp knife or a glittering  axe; butshe shrunk from him as he signed her with the sign of the cross on herforehead  and breast, and sat before him like a tame bird, with herhead bowed down.\"\\nThen he  spoke to her, in gentle words, of the deed oflove she had performed for him during  the night, when she had cometo him in the form of an ugly frog, to loosen his bonds,  and to leadhim forth to life and light; and he told her that she was bound incloser  fetters than he had been, and that she could recover alsolife and light by his means.\"\\n He would take her to Hedeby to St.Ansgarius, and there, in that Christian town, the  spell of thesorcerer would be removed.\"\\nBut he would not let her sit before himon the  horse, though of her own free will she wished to do so.\"\\n\"Thoumust sit behind me, not  before me,\" said he.\"\\n\"Thy magic beauty has amagic power which comes from an evil origin,  and I fear it; still I amsure to overcome through my faith in Christ.\"\\n Then he knelt  down,and prayed with pious fervor.\"\\nIt was as if the quiet woodland were aholy church  consecrated by his worship.\"\\nThe birds sang as if they werealso of this new congregation;  and the fragrance of the wild flowerswas as the ambrosial perfume of incense; while,  above all, sounded thewords of Scripture, \"A light to them that sit in darkness and  in theshadow of death, to guide their feet into the way of peace.\"\\n And hespoke these  words with the deep longing of his whole nature.\"\\n Meanwhile, the horse that had carried them in wild career stoodquietly by, plucking  at the tall bramble-bushes, till the ripe youngberries fell down upon Helga\\'s hands,  as if inviting her to eat.Patiently she allowed herself to be lifted on the horse,  and sat therelike a somnambulist- as one who walked in his sleep.\"\\nThe Christianbound  two branches together with bark, in the form of a cross, andheld it on high as they  rode through the forest.\"\\nThe way graduallygrew thicker of brushwood, as they rode  along, till at last itbecame a trackless wilderness.\"\\nBushes of the wild sloe here  andthere blocked up the path, so that they had to ride over them.\"\\nThebubbling spring  formed not a stream, but a marsh, round which alsothey were obliged to guide the horse;  still there were strength andrefreshment in the cool forest breeze, and no trifling  power in thegentle words spoken in faith and Christian love by the young priest,whose  inmost heart yearned to lead this poor lost one into the wayof light and life.\"\\nIt  is said that rain-drops can make a hollow in thehardest stone, and the waves of the  sea can smooth and round the roughedges of the rocks; so did the dew of mercy fall  upon Helga, softeningwhat was hard, and smoothing what was rough in her character.\"\\n Theseeffects did not yet appear; she was not herself aware of them; neitherdoes the  seed in the lap of earth know, when the refreshing dew andthe warm sunbeams fall upon  it, that it contains within itself powerby which it will flourish and bloom.\"\\nThe song  of the mother sinks intothe heart of the child, and the little one prattles the words  afterher, without understanding their meaning; but after a time thethoughts expand,  and what has been heard in childhood seems to themind clear and bright.\"\\nSo now the  \"Word,\" which is all-powerful tocreate, was working in the heart of Helga.\"\\n They rode forth from the thick forest, crossed the heath, andagain entered a pathless  wood.\"\\nHere, towards evening, they met withrobbers.\"\\n \"Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden?\"\\n cried the robbers,seizing the horse  by the bridle, and dragging the two riders fromits back.\"\\n The priest had nothing to defend himself with, but the knife hehad taken from Helga,  and with this he struck out right and left.One of the robbers raised his axe against  him; but the young priestsprang on one side, and avoided the blow, which fell with  greatforce on the horse\\'s neck, so that the blood gushed forth, and theanimal sunk  to the ground.\"\\nThen Helga seemed suddenly to awake fromher long, deep reverie; she  threw herself hastily upon the dyinganimal.\"\\nThe priest placed himself before her,  to defend and shelterher; but one of the robbers swung his iron axe against the  Christian\\'shead with such force that it was dashed to pieces, the blood andbrains  were scattered about, and he fell dead upon the ground.\"\\nThenthe robbers seized  beautiful Helga by her white arms and slenderwaist; but at that moment the sun went  down, and as its last raydisappeared, she was changed into the form of a frog.\"\\nA  greenish whitemouth spread half over her face; her arms became thin and slimy;  whilebroad hands, with webbed fingers, spread themselves out like fans.Then the  robbers, in terror, let her go, and she stood among them, ahideous monster; and as  is the nature of frogs to do, she hopped up ashigh as her own size, and disappeared  in the thicket.\"\\nThen the robbersknew that this must be the work of an evil spirit  or some secretsorcery, and, in a terrible fright, they ran hastily from the spot.\"\\n The full moon had already risen, and was shining in all herradiant splendor over the  earth, when from the thicket, in the form ofa frog, crept poor Helga.\"\\nShe stood still  by the corpse of theChristian priest, and the carcase of the dead horse.\"\\nShe looked  atthem with eyes that seemed to weep, and from the frog\\'s head cameforth a croaking  sound, as when a child bursts into tears.\"\\nShe threwherself first upon one, and then  upon the other; brought water inher hand, which, from being webbed, was large and  hollow, and pouredit over them; but they were dead, and dead they would remain.\"\\n Sheunderstood that at last.\"\\nSoon wild animals would come and tear theirdead bodies;  but no, that must not happen.\"\\nThen she dug up theearth, as deep as she was able, that  she might prepare a grave forthem.\"\\nShe had nothing but a branch of a tree and her  two hands,between the fingers of which the webbed skin stretched, and theywere torn  by the work, while the blood ran down her hands.\"\\nShe sawat last that her work would  be useless, more than she couldaccomplish; so she fetched more water, and washed the  face of thedead, and then covered it with fresh green leaves; she also broughtlarge  boughs and spread over him, and scattered dried leaves betweenthe branches.\"\\nThen she  brought the heaviest stones that she couldcarry, and laid them over the dead body,  filling up the creviceswith moss, till she thought she had fenced in his  resting-placestrongly enough.\"\\nThe difficult task had employed her the wholenight;  and as the sun broke forth, there stood the beautiful Helgain all her loveliness,  with her bleeding hands, and, for the firsttime, with tears on her maiden cheeks.\"\\n It was, in this transformation,as if two natures were striving together within her;  her whole frametrembled, and she looked around her as if she had just awoke from  apainful dream.\"\\nShe leaned for support against the trunk of a slendertree, and at  last climbed to the topmost branches, like a cat, andseated herself firmly upon them.\"\\n She remained there the whole day,sitting alone, like a frightened squirrel, in the  silent solitude ofthe wood, where the rest and stillness is as the calm of death.\"\\n Butterflies fluttered around her, and close by were severalant-hills, each with its  hundreds of busy little creatures movingquickly to and fro.\"\\nIn the air, danced myriads  of gnats, swarm uponswarm, troops of buzzing flies, ladybirds, dragon-flies with  goldenwings, and other little winged creatures.\"\\nThe worm crawled forthfrom the moist  ground, and the moles crept out; but, exceptingthese, all around had the stillness  of death: but when people saythis, they do not quite understand themselves what they  mean.\"\\nNonenoticed Helga but a flock of magpies, which flew chattering roundthe top  of the tree on which she sat.\"\\nThese birds hopped close toher on the branches with  bold curiosity.\"\\nA glance from her eyes wasa signal to frighten them away, and they  were not clever enough tofind out who she was; indeed she hardly knew herself.\"\\n When the sun was near setting, and the evening\\'s twilight about tocommence, the  approaching transformation aroused her to freshexertion.\"\\nShe let herself down gently  from the tree, and, as thelast sunbeam vanished, she stood again in the wrinkled form  of a frog,with the torn, webbed skin on her hands, but her eyes now gleamed withmore  radiant beauty than they had ever possessed in her most beautifulform of loveliness;  they were now pure, mild maidenly eyes thatshone forth in the face of a frog.\"\\nThey  showed the existence of deepfeeling and a human heart, and the beauteous eyes  overflowed withtears, weeping precious drops that lightened the heart.\"\\n On the raised mound which she had made as a grave for the deadpriest, she found the  cross made of the branches of a tree, the lastwork of him who now lay dead and cold  beneath it.\"\\nA sudden thoughtcame to Helga, and she lifted up the cross and planted  it upon thegrave, between the stones that covered him and the dead horse.\"\\nThe  sadrecollection brought the tears to her eyes, and in this gentlespirit she traced  the same sign in the sand round the grave; and asshe formed, with both her hands,  the sign of the cross, the web skinfell from them like a torn glove.\"\\nShe washed her  hands in the water ofthe spring, and gazed with astonishment at their delicate  whiteness.Again she made the holy sign in the air, between herself and thedead man;  her lips trembled, her tongue moved, and the name whichshe in her ride through the  forest had so often heard spoken, roseto her lips, and she uttered the words, \"Jesus  Christ.\"\\n Then thefrog skin fell from her; she was once more a lovely maiden.\"\\nHer  headbent wearily, her tired limbs required rest, and then she slept.\"\\n Her sleep, however, was short.\"\\nTowards midnight, she awoke; beforeher stood the dead  horse, prancing and full of life, which shone forthfrom his eyes and from his wounded  neck.\"\\nClose by his side appearedthe murdered Christian priest, more beautiful than  Baldur, as theViking\\'s wife had said; but now he came as if in a flame of fire.\"\\n Suchgravity, such stern justice, such a piercing glance shone from hislarge, gentle  eyes, that it seemed to penetrate into every corner ofher heart.\"\\nBeautiful Helga  trembled at the look, and her memoryreturned with a power as if it had been the day  of judgment.\"\\nEverygood deed that had been done for her, every loving word that hadbeen  said, were vividly before her mind.\"\\nShe understood now thatlove had kept her here  during the day of her trial; while the creatureformed of dust and clay, soul and spirit,  had wrestled and struggledwith evil.\"\\nShe acknowledged that she had only followed the  impulses ofan evil disposition, that she had done nothing to cure herself;everything  had been given her, and all had happened as it were bythe ordination of Providence.\"\\n She bowed herself humbly, confessedher great imperfections in the sight of Him who  can read every faultof the heart, and then the priest spoke.\"\\n\"Daughter of the  moorland,thou hast come from the swamp and the marshy earth, but from this thoushalt  arise.\"\\nThe sunlight shining into thy inmost soul proves theorigin from which thou  hast really sprung, and has restored the bodyto its natural form.\"\\nI am come to thee  from the land of the dead,and thou also must pass through the valley to reach the  holy mountainswhere mercy and perfection dwell.\"\\nI cannot lead thee to Hedeby thatthou  mayst receive Christian baptism, for first thou must remove thethick veil with which  the waters of the moorland are shrouded, andbring forth from its depths the living  author of thy being and thylife.\"\\nTill this is done, thou canst not receive  consecration.\"\\n  Then he lifted her on the horse and gave her a golden censer,similar to those she  had already seen at the Viking\\'s house.\"\\nA sweetperfume arose from it, while the open  wound in the forehead of theslain priest, shone with the rays of a diamond.\"\\nHe took  the cross fromthe grave, and held it aloft, and now they rode through the air overthe  rustling trees, over the hills where warriors lay buried each byhis dead war-horse;  and the brazen monumental figures rose up andgalloped forth, and stationed themselves  on the summits of thehills.\"\\nThe golden crescent on their foreheads, fastened with  goldenknots, glittered in the moonlight, and their mantles floated in thewind.\"\\nThe  dragon, that guards buried treasure, lifted his head andgazed after them.\"\\nThe goblins  and the satyrs peeped out from beneaththe hills, and flitted to and fro in the fields,  waving blue, red, andgreen torches, like the glowing sparks in burning paper.\"\\nOver  woodlandand heath, flood and fen, they flew on, till they reached the wildmoor, over  which they hovered in broad circles.\"\\nThe Christian priestheld the cross aloft, and  it glittered like gold, while from hislips sounded pious prayers.\"\\nBeautiful Helga\\'s  voice joined with his inthe hymns he sung, as a child joins in her mother\\'s song.\"\\n She swungthe censer, and a wonderful fragrance of incense arose from it; sopowerful,  that the reeds and rushes of the moor burst forth intoblossom.\"\\nEach germ came forth  from the deep ground: all that hadlife raised itself.\"\\nBlooming water-lilies spread  themselves forth likea carpet of wrought flowers, and upon them lay a slumbering  woman,young and beautiful.\"\\nHelga fancied that it was her own image she sawreflected  in the still water.\"\\nBut it was her mother she beheld, thewife of the Marsh King, the  princess from the land of the Nile.\"\\n The dead Christian priest desired that the sleeping woman shouldbe lifted on the horse,  but the horse sank beneath the load, as ifhe had been a funeral pall fluttering in  the wind.\"\\nBut the sign of thecross made the airy phantom strong, and then the three  rode awayfrom the marsh to firm ground.\"\\n At the same moment the cock crew in the Viking\\'s castle, and thedream figures dissolved  and floated away in the air, but mother anddaughter stood opposite to each other.\"\\n \"Am I looking at my own image in the deep water?\"\\n said the mother.\"\\n \"Is it myself that I see represented on a white shield?\"\\n cried thedaughter.\"\\n Then they came nearer to each other in a fond embrace.\"\\nThemother\\'s heart beat quickly,  and she understood the quickenedpulses.\"\\n\"My child!\"\\n she exclaimed, \"the flower of  my heart- my lotusflower of the deep water!\"\\n and she embraced her child again andwept,  and the tears were as a baptism of new life and love forHelga.\"\\n\"In swan\\'s plumage  I came here,\" said the mother, \"and here Ithrew off my feather dress.\"\\nThen I sank  down through the waveringground, deep into the marsh beneath, which closed like a  wall aroundme; I found myself after a while in fresher water; still a powerdrew me  down deeper and deeper.\"\\nI felt the weight of sleep upon myeyelids.\"\\nThen I slept, and  dreams hovered round me.\"\\nIt seemed to me asif I were again in the pyramids of Egypt,  and yet the waving eldertrunk that had frightened me on the moor stood ever before  me.\"\\nIobserved the clefts and wrinkles in the stem; they shone forth instrange colors,  and took the form of hieroglyphics.\"\\nIt was the mummycase on which I gazed.\"\\nAt last  it burst, and forth stepped thethousand years\\' old king, the mummy form, black as  pitch, black as theshining wood-snail, or the slimy mud of the swamp.\"\\nWhether it  wasreally the mummy or the Marsh King I know not.\"\\nHe seized me in hisarms, and I felt  as if I must die.\"\\nWhen I recovered myself, I found inmy bosom a little bird, flapping  its wings, twittering and fluttering.The bird flew away from my bosom, upwards towards  the dark, heavycanopy above me, but a long, green band kept it fastened to me.\"\\nIheard  and understood the tenor of its longings.\"\\nFreedom!\"\\nsunlight!to my father!\"\\nThen I  thought of my father, and the sunny land of mybirth, my life, and my love.\"\\nThen I  loosened the band, and let thebird fly away to its home- to a father.\"\\nSince that hour  I haveceased to dream; my sleep has been long and heavy, till in this veryhour, harmony  and fragrance awoke me, and set me free.\"\\n  The green band which fastened the wings of the bird to themother\\'s heart, where did  it flutter now?\"\\nwhither had it beenwafted?\"\\nThe stork only had seen it.\"\\nThe band was  the green stalk,the cup of the flower the cradle in which lay the child, that now  inblooming beauty had been folded to the mother\\'s heart.\"\\n And while the two were resting in each other\\'s arms, the old storkflew round and round  them in narrowing circles, till at length he flewaway swiftly to his nest, and fetched  away the two suits of swan\\'sfeathers, which he had preserved there for many years.\"\\n Then hereturned to the mother and daughter, and threw the swan\\'s plumage overthem;  the feathers immediately closed around them, and they rose upfrom the earth in the  form of two white swans.\"\\n \"And now we can converse with pleasure,\" said the stork-papa;\"we can understand one  another, although the beaks of birds are sodifferent in shape.\"\\nIt is very fortunate  that you came to-night.To-morrow we should have been gone.\"\\nThe mother, myself and  thelittle ones, we\\'re about to fly to the south.\"\\nLook at me now: I aman old friend  from the Nile, and a mother\\'s heart contains more thanher beak.\"\\nShe always said that  the princess would know how to helpherself.\"\\nI and the young ones carried the swan\\'s  feathers over here,and I am glad of it now, and how lucky it is that I am here still.When  the day dawns we shall start with a great company of otherstorks.\"\\nWe\\'ll fly first,  and you can follow in our track, so thatyou cannot miss your way.\"\\nI and the young  ones will have an eye uponyou.\"\\n  \"And the lotus-flower which I was to take with me,\" said theEgyptian princess, \"is  flying here by my side, clothed in swan\\'sfeathers.\"\\nThe flower of my heart will travel  with me; and so theriddle is solved.\"\\nNow for home!\"\\nnow for home!\"\\n  But Helga said she could not leave the Danish land without oncemore seeing her  foster-mother, the loving wife of the Viking.\"\\nEachpleasing recollection, each kind  word, every tear from the heart whichher foster-mother had wept for her, rose in her  mind, and at thatmoment she felt as if she loved this mother the best.\"\\n \"Yes, we must go to the Viking\\'s castle,\" said the stork;\"mother and the young ones  are waiting for me there.\"\\nHow they willopen their eyes and flap their wings!\"\\nMy wife,  you see, does not saymuch; she is short and abrupt in her manner; but she means well,  forall that.\"\\nI will flap my wings at once, that they may hear us coming.\"\\nThen  stork-papa flapped his wings in first-rate style, and he andthe swans flew away to  the Viking\\'s castle.\"\\n In the castle, every one was in a deep sleep.\"\\nIt had been latein the evening before  the Viking\\'s wife retired to rest.\"\\nShe wasanxious about Helga, who, three days before,  had vanished with theChristian priest.\"\\nHelga must have helped him in his flight, for  it washer horse that was missed from the stable; but by what power had allthis been  accomplished?\"\\nThe Viking\\'s wife thought of it with wonder,thought on the miracles  which they said could be performed by thosewho believed in the Christian faith, and  followed its teachings.\"\\nThesepassing thoughts formed themselves into a vivid dream,  and it seemedto her that she was still lying awake on her couch, while withoutdarkness  reigned.\"\\nA storm arose; she heard the lake dashing androlling from east and west,  like the waves of the North Sea or theCattegat.\"\\nThe monstrous snake which, it is said,  surrounds the earthin the depths of the ocean, was trembling in spasmodic  convulsions.The night of the fall of the gods was come, \"Ragnorock,\" as theheathens  call the judgment-day, when everything shall pass away,even the high gods themselves.\"\\n The war trumpet sounded; riding uponthe rainbow, came the gods, clad in steel, to  fight their lastbattle on the last battle-field.\"\\nBefore them flew the winged  vampires,and the dead warriors closed up the train.\"\\nThe whole firmament wasablaze  with the northern lights, and yet the darkness triumphed.\"\\nItwas a terrible hour.\"\\nAnd,  close to the terrified woman, Helga seemedto be seated on the floor, in the hideous  form of a frog, yettrembling, and clinging to her foster-mother, who took her on her  lap,and lovingly caressed her, hideous and frog-like as she was.\"\\nThe airwas filled  with the clashing of arms and the hissing of arrows, asif a storm of hail was descending  upon the earth.\"\\nIt seemed to her thehour when earth and sky would burst asunder, and  all things beswallowed up in Saturn\\'s fiery lake; but she knew that a new heavenand  a new earth would arise, and that corn-fields would wave where nowthe lake rolled  over desolate sands, and the ineffable God reign.\"\\nThenshe saw rising from the region  of the dead, Baldur the gentle, theloving, and as the Viking\\'s wife gazed upon him,  she recognized hiscountenance.\"\\nIt was the captive Christian priest.\"\\n\"White  Christian!\"\\nshe exclaimed aloud, and with the words, she pressed a kiss on theforehead  of the hideous frog-child.\"\\nThen the frog-skin fell off, andHelga stood before her  in all her beauty, more lovely andgentle-looking, and with eyes beaming with love.\"\\n She kissed thehands of her foster-mother, blessed her for all her fostering love  andcare during the days of her trial and misery, for the thoughts she hadsuggested  and awoke in her heart, and for naming the Name which shenow repeated.\"\\nThen beautiful  Helga rose as a mighty swan, and spreadher wings with the rushing sound of troops  of birds of passageflying through the air.\"\\n Then the Viking\\'s wife awoke, but she still heard the rushingsound without.\"\\nShe knew  it was the time for the storks to depart,and that it must be their wings which she  heard.\"\\nShe felt she shouldlike to see them once more, and bid them farewell.\"\\nShe rose  from hercouch, stepped out on the threshold, and beheld, on the ridge of theroof,  a party of storks ranged side by side.\"\\nTroops of the birdswere flying in circles over  the castle and the highest trees; but justbefore her, as she stood on the threshold  and close to the wellwhere Helga had so often sat and alarmed her with her wildness,  nowstood two swans, gazing at her with intelligent eyes.\"\\nThen sheremembered her dream,  which still appeared to her as a reality.\"\\nShethought of Helga in the form of a swan.\"\\n She thought of a Christianpriest, and suddenly a wonderful joy arose in her heart.\"\\n The swansflapped their wings and arched their necks as if to offer her agreeting,  and the Viking\\'s wife spread out her arms towards them, asif she accepted it, and  smiled through her tears.\"\\nShe was rousedfrom deep thought by a rustling of wings and  snapping of beaks; allthe storks arose, and started on their journey towards the  south.\"\\n \"We will not wait for the swans,\" said the mamma stork; \"if theywant to go with us,  let them come now; we can\\'t sit here till theplovers start.\"\\nIt is a fine thing after  all to travel in families, notlike the finches and the partridges.\"\\nThere the male  and the femalebirds fly in separate flocks, which, to speak candidly, I considervery  unbecoming.\"\\n  \"What are those swans flapping their wings for?\"\\n  \"Well, every one flies in his own fashion,\" said the papa stork.\"\\nThe swans fly in  an oblique line; the cranes, in the form of atriangle; and the plovers, in a curved  line like a snake.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t talk about snakes while we are flying up here,\" saidstork-mamma.\"\\n\"It puts ideas  into the children\\'s heads that can notbe realized.\"\\n  \"Are those the high mountains I have heard spoken of?\"\\n askedHelga, in the swan\\'s  plumage.\"\\n \"They are storm-clouds driving along beneath us,\" replied hermother.\"\\n \"What are yonder white clouds that rise so high?\"\\n again inquiredHelga.\"\\n \"Those are mountains covered with perpetual snows, that you seeyonder,\" said her  mother.\"\\nAnd then they flew across the Alps towardsthe blue Mediterranean.\"\\n \"Africa\\'s land!\"\\nEgyptia\\'s strand!\"\\n sang the daughter of theNile, in her swan\\'s plumage,  as from the upper air she caught sight ofher native land, a narrow, golden, wavy strip  on the shores of theNile; the other birds espied it also and hastened their flight.\"\\n \"I can smell the Nile mud and the wet frogs,\" said thestork-mamma, \"and I begin to  feel quite hungry.\"\\nYes, now you shalltaste something nice, and you will see the  marabout bird, and theibis, and the crane.\"\\nThey all belong to our family, but they  are notnearly so handsome as we are.\"\\nThey give themselves great airs,especially the  ibis.\"\\nThe Egyptians have spoilt him.\"\\nThey make amummy of him, and stuff him with spices.\"\\n I would rather be stuffedwith live frogs, and so would you, and so you shall.\"\\nBetter  havesomething in your inside while you are alive, than to be made a paradeof after  you are dead.\"\\nThat is my opinion, and I am always right.\"\\n  \"The storks are come,\" was said in the great house on the banks ofthe Nile, where  the lord lay in the hall on his downy cushions,covered with a leopard skin, scarcely  alive, yet not dead, waiting andhoping for the lotus-flower from the deep moorland  in the far north.Relatives and servants were standing by his couch, when the  twobeautiful swans who had come with the storks flew into the hall.They threw off  their soft white plumage, and two lovely female formsapproached the pale, sick old  man, and threw back their long hair, andwhen Helga bent over her grandfather, redness  came back to his cheeks,his eyes brightened, and life returned to his benumbed limbs.\"\\n Theold man rose up with health and energy renewed; daughter andgrandchild welcomed  him as joyfully as if with a morning greetingafter a long and troubled dream.\"\\n Joy reigned through the whole house, as well as in the stork\\'snest; although there  the chief cause was really the good food,especially the quantities of frogs, which  seemed to spring out ofthe ground in swarms.\"\\n Then the learned men hastened to note down, in flyingcharacters, the story of the  two princesses, and spoke of thearrival of the health-giving flower as a mighty event,  which hadbeen a blessing to the house and the land.\"\\nMeanwhile, the stork-papatold  the story to his family in his own way; but not till they hadeaten and were satisfied;  otherwise they would have had something elseto do than to listen to stories.\"\\n \"Well,\" said the stork-mamma, when she had heard it, \"you willbe made something of  at last; I suppose they can do nothing less.\"\\n  \"What could I be made?\"\\n said stork-papa; \"what have I done?-just nothing.\"\\n  \"You have done more than all the rest,\" she replied.\"\\n\"But foryou and the youngsters  the two young princesses would never haveseen Egypt again, and the recovery of the  old man would not havebeen effected.\"\\nYou will become something.\"\\nThey must certainly  give youa doctor\\'s hood, and our young ones will inherit it, and theirchildren after  them, and so on.\"\\nYou already look like an Egyptiandoctor, at least in my eyes.\"\\n  \"I cannot quite remember the words I heard when I listened onthe roof,\" said stork-papa,  while relating the story to his family;\"all I know is, that what the wise men said  was so complicated andso learned, that they received not only rank, but presents;  even thehead cook at the great house was honored with a mark of distinction,most likely  for the soup.\"\\n  \"And what did you receive?\"\\n said the stork-mamma.\"\\n\"Theycertainly ought not to forget  the most important person in the affair,as you really are.\"\\nThe learned men have done  nothing at all but usetheir tongues.\"\\nSurely they will not overlook you.\"\\n  Late in the night, while the gentle sleep of peace rested on thenow happy house, there  was still one watcher.\"\\nIt was not stork-papa,who, although he stood on guard on one  leg, could sleep soundly.\"\\nHelgaalone was awake.\"\\nShe leaned over the balcony, gazing  at thesparkling stars that shone clearer and brighter in the pure air thanthey had  done in the north, and yet they were the same stars.\"\\nShethought of the Viking\\'s wife  in the wild moorland, of the gentleeyes of her foster-mother, and of the tears she  had shed over the poorfrog-child that now lived in splendor and starry beauty by  thewaters of the Nile, with air balmy and sweet as spring.\"\\nShe thought ofthe love  that dwelt in the breast of the heathen woman, love thathad been shown to a wretched  creature, hateful as a human being, andhideous when in the form of an animal.\"\\nShe  looked at the glitteringstars, and thought of the radiance that had shone forth on  theforehead of the dead man, as she had fled with him over the woodlandand moor.\"\\nTones  were awakened in her memory; words which she had heardhim speak as they rode onward,  when she was carried, wondering andtrembling, through the air; words from the great  Fountain of love, thehighest love that embraces all the human race.\"\\nWhat had not been  wonand achieved by this love?\"\\n Day and night beautiful Helga was absorbed in the contemplation ofthe great amount  of her happiness, and lost herself in thecontemplation, like a child who turns  hurriedly from the giver toexamine the beautiful gifts.\"\\nShe was over-powered with  her goodfortune, which seemed always increasing, and therefore what might itbecome  in the future?\"\\nHad she not been brought by a wonderfulmiracle to all this joy and  happiness?\"\\nAnd in these thoughts sheindulged, until at last she thought no more of  the Giver.\"\\nIt was theover-abundance of youthful spirits unfolding its wings for a  daringflight.\"\\nHer eyes sparkled with energy, when suddenly arose a loudnoise in the  court below, and the daring thought vanished.\"\\nShelooked down, and saw two large  ostriches running round quickly innarrow circles; she had never seen these creatures  before,- great,coarse, clumsy-looking birds with curious wings that looked as if  theyhad been clipped, and the birds themselves had the appearance ofhaving been  roughly used.\"\\nShe inquired about them, and for the firsttime heard the legend which  the Egyptians relate respecting theostrich.\"\\n Once, say they, the ostriches were a beautiful and glorious raceof birds, with large,  strong wings.\"\\nOne evening the other largebirds of the forest said to the ostrich,  \"Brother, shall we fly to theriver to-morrow morning to drink, God willing?\"\\n and the  ostrichanswered, \"I will.\"\\n  With the break of day, therefore, they commenced their flight;first rising high in  the air, towards the sun, which is the eye ofGod; still higher and higher the ostrich  flew, far above the otherbirds, proudly approaching the light, trusting in its own  strength,and thinking not of the Giver, or saying, \"if God will.\"\\n When suddenlythe  avenging angel drew back the veil from the flaming ocean ofsunlight, and in a moment  the wings of the proud bird were scorchedand shrivelled, and they sunk miserably to  the earth.\"\\nSince thattime the ostrich and his race have never been able to rise in  the air;they can only fly terror-stricken along the ground, or run round andround  in narrow circles.\"\\nIt is a warning to mankind, that in all ourthoughts and schemes,  and in every action we undertake, we should say,\"if God will.\"\\n  Then Helga bowed her head thoughtfully and seriously, and lookedat the circling  ostrich, as with timid fear and simple pleasure itglanced at its own great shadow  on the sunlit walls.\"\\nAnd the storyof the ostrich sunk deeply into the heart and mind  of Helga: a life ofhappiness, both in the present and in the future, seemed secure  forher, and what was yet to come might be the best of all, God willing.\"\\n Early in the spring, when the storks were again about to journeynorthward, beautiful  Helga took off her golden bracelets, scratchedher name on them, and beckoned to the  stork-father.\"\\nHe came to her,and she placed the golden circlet round his neck, and  begged him todeliver it safely to the Viking\\'s wife, so that she might know thather  foster-daughter still lived, was happy, and had not forgotten her.\"\\n \"It is rather heavy to carry,\" thought stork-papa, when he hadit on his neck; \"but  gold and honor are not to be flung into thestreet.\"\\nThe stork brings good fortune\\ufffethey\\'ll be obliged toacknowledge that at last.\"\\n  \"You lay gold, and I lay eggs,\" said stork-mamma; \"with you itis only once in a way,  I lay eggs every year But no one appreciateswhat we do; I call it very mortifying.\"\\n  \"But then we have a consciousness of our own worth, mother,\"replied stork-papa.\"\\n \"What good will that do you?\"\\n retorted stork-mamma; \"it willneither bring you a fair  wind, nor a good meal.\"\\n  \"The little nightingale, who is singing yonder in the tamarindgrove, will soon be  going north, too.\"\\n Helga said she had oftenheard her singing on the wild moor, so  she determined to send amessage by her.\"\\nWhile flying in the swan\\'s plumage she had  learntthe bird language; she had often conversed with the stork and theswallow, and  she knew that the nightingale would understand.\"\\nSo shebegged the nightingale to fly  to the beechwood, on the peninsula ofJutland, where a mound of stone and twigs had  been raised to formthe grave, and she begged the nightingale to persuade all the  otherlittle birds to build their nests round the place, so that evermoreshould resound  over that grave music and song.\"\\nAnd the nightingaleflew away, and time flew away also.\"\\n In the autumn, an eagle, standing upon a pyramid, saw a statelytrain of richly laden  camels, and men attired in armor on foamingArabian steeds, whose glossy skins shone  like silver, their nostrilswere pink, and their thick, flowing manes hung almost to  their slenderlegs.\"\\nA royal prince of Arabia, handsome as a prince should be,  andaccompanied by distinguished guests, was on his way to the statelyhouse, on the  roof of which the storks\\' empty nests might be seen.They were away now in the far  north, but expected to return very soon.And, indeed, they returned on a day that was  rich in joy and gladness.\"\\n A marriage was being celebrated, in which the beautiful Helga,glittering in silk and  jewels, was the bride, and the bridegroom theyoung Arab prince.\"\\nBride and bridegroom  sat at the upper end of thetable, between the bride\\'s mother and grandfather.\"\\nBut  her gaze wasnot on the bridegroom, with his manly, sunburnt face, round whichcurled  a black beard, and whose dark fiery eyes were fixed upon her;but away from him, at  a twinkling star, that shone down upon herfrom the sky.\"\\nThen was heard the sound of  rushing wings beating theair.\"\\nThe storks were coming home; and the old stork pair,  althoughtired with the journey and requiring rest, did not fail to fly down atonce  to the balustrades of the verandah, for they knew already whatfeast was being  celebrated.\"\\nThey had heard of it on the borders of theland, and also that Helga had  caused their figures to be representedon the walls, for they belonged to her history.\"\\n \"I call that very sensible and pretty,\" said stork-papa.\"\\n \"Yes, but it is very little,\" said mamma stork; \"they could notpossibly have done  less.\"\\n  But, when Helga saw them, she rose and went out into theverandah to stroke the backs  of the storks.\"\\nThe old stork pair bowedtheir heads, and curved their necks, and even  the youngest among theyoung ones felt honored by this reception.\"\\n Helga continued to gaze upon the glittering star, which seemedto glow brighter and  purer in its light; then between herself andthe star floated a form, purer than the  air, and visible through it.It floated quite near to her, and she saw that it was  the deadChristian priest, who also was coming to her wedding feast- comingfrom the  heavenly kingdom.\"\\n \"The glory and brightness, yonder, outshines all that is knownon earth,\" said he.\"\\n Then Helga the fair prayed more gently, and more earnestly, thanshe had ever prayed  in her life before, that she might be permitted togaze, if only for a single moment,  at the glory and brightness ofthe heavenly kingdom.\"\\nThen she felt herself lifted up,  as it were,above the earth, through a sea of sound and thought; not only aroundher,  but within her, was there light and song, such as words cannotexpress.\"\\n \"Now we must return;\" he said; \"you will be missed.\"\\n  \"Only one more look,\" she begged; \"but one short moment more.\"\\n  \"We must return to earth; the guests will have all departed.Only one more look!- the  last!\"\\n  Then Helga stood again in the verandah.\"\\nBut the marriage lampsin the festive hall  had been all extinguished, and the torches outsidehad vanished.\"\\nThe storks were gone;  not a guest could be seen; nobridegroom- all in those few short moments seemed to  have died.\"\\nThen agreat dread fell upon her.\"\\nShe stepped from the verandah through  theempty hall into the next chamber, where slept strange warriors.\"\\nSheopened a side  door, which once led into her own apartment, but now, asshe passed through, she found  herself suddenly in a garden which shehad never before seen here, the sky blushed  red, it was the dawn ofmorning.\"\\nThree minutes only in heaven, and a whole night on  earthhad passed away!\"\\nThen she saw the storks, and called to them intheir own language.\"\\n Then stork-papa turned his head towards here, listened to herwords, and drew near.\"\\n \"You speak our language,\" said he, \"what doyou wish?\"\\nWhy do you appear,- you- a strange  woman?\"\\n  \"It is I- it is Helga!\"\\nDost thou not know me?\"\\nThree minutes ago wewere speaking together  yonder in the verandah.\"\\n  \"That is a mistake,\" said the stork, \"you must have dreamed allthis.\"\\n  \"No, no,\" she exclaimed.\"\\nThen she reminded him of the Viking\\'scastle, of the great  lake, and of the journey across the ocean.\"\\n Then stork-papa winked his eyes, and said, \"Why that\\'s an oldstory which happened  in the time of my grandfather.\"\\nThere certainlywas a princess of that kind here in  Egypt once, who came from theDanish land, but she vanished on the evening of her  wedding day,many hundred years ago, and never came back.\"\\nYou may read about ityourself  yonder, on a monument in the garden.\"\\nThere you will findswans and storks sculptured,  and on the top is a figure of theprincess Helga, in marble.\"\\n  And so it was; Helga understood it all now, and sank on her knees.The sun burst forth  in all its glory, and, as in olden times, the formof the frog vanished in his beams,  and the beautiful form stoodforth in all its loveliness; so now, bathed in light,  rose a beautifulform, purer, clearer than air- a ray of brightness- from the Source  oflight Himself.\"\\nThe body crumbled into dust, and a faded lotus-flowerlay on the spot  on which Helga had stood.\"\\n \"Now that is a new ending to the story,\" said stork-papa; \"Ireally never expected  it would end in this way, but it seems a verygood ending.\"\\n  \"And what will the young ones say to it, I wonder?\"\\n saidstork-mamma.\"\\n \"Ah, that is a very important question,\" replied the stork.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE METAL PIG  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del Granduca,runs a little street  called Porta Rosa.\"\\nIn this street, just infront of the market-place where vegetables  are sold, stands a pig,made of brass and curiously formed.\"\\nThe bright color has  beenchanged by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from thesnout, which  shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed ithas, for hundreds of poor people  and children seize it in theirhands as they place their mouths close to the mouth  of the animal,to drink.\"\\nIt is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping  thewell-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lipsagainst its jaws.\"\\n Every one who visits Florence can very quicklyfind the place; he has only to ask the  first beggar he meets for theMetal Pig, and he will be told where it is.\"\\n It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were covered withsnow, but the moon  shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like adull winter\\'s day in the north; indeed  it is better, for clear airseems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a  cold, gray,leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold dampearth  shall one day press on us in the grave.\"\\nIn the garden of thegrand duke\\'s palace, under  the roof of one of the wings, where athousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged  boy had been sittingthe whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy,lovely  and smiling, and yet still suffering.\"\\nHe was hungry andthirsty, yet no one gave him  anything; and when it became dark, andthey were about to close the gardens, the porter  turned him out.\"\\nHestood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno,  andlooking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowedbetween him  and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita.\"\\nHe thenwalked away towards the Metal  Pig, half knelt down, clasped it withhis arms, and then put his mouth to the shining  snout and drank deepdraughts of the fresh water.\"\\nClose by, lay a few salad-leaves  andtwo chestnuts, which were to serve for his supper.\"\\nNo one was in thestreet but  himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seatedhimself on the pig\\'s back, leaned  forward so that his curly head couldrest on the head of the animal, and, before he  was aware, he fellasleep.\"\\n It was midnight.\"\\nThe Metal Pig raised himself gently, and theboy heard him say quite  distinctly, \"Hold tight, little boy, for Iam going to run;\" and away he started for  a most wonderful ride.First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal  horsewhich bears the duke\\'s statue, neighed aloud.\"\\nThe paintedcoats-of-arms on the  old council-house shone like transparentpictures, and Michael Angelo\\'s David tossed  his sling; it was as ifeverything had life.\"\\nThe metallic groups of figures, among  whichwere Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like livingpersons, and cries  of terror sounded from them all across the noblesquare.\"\\nBy the Palazzo degli Uffizi,  in the arcade, where the nobilityassemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped.\"\\n \"Hold fast,\" saidthe animal; \"hold fast, for I am going up stairs.\"\\n  The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and halfafraid.\"\\nThey entered a  long gallery, where the boy had been before.The walls were resplendent with paintings;  here stood statues andbusts, all in a clear light as if it were day.\"\\nBut the  grandestappeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy couldremember  what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-nighteverything shone in its brightest  colors.\"\\nHere stood the figure of abeautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as  possible by one of thegreat masters.\"\\nHer graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins  sprang ather feet, and immortality shone from her eyes.\"\\nThe world called herthe Venus  de\\' Medici.\"\\nBy her side were statues, in which the spirit oflife breathed in stone;  figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword,and was named the Grinder; wrestling  gladiators formed anothergroup, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove  forthe goddess of beauty.\"\\nThe boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for thewalls were  gleaming with bright colors, all appeared living reality.\"\\n As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself;and as the Metal  Pig went step by step from one picture to theother, the little boy could see it all  plainly.\"\\nOne glory eclipsedanother; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on  the littleboy\\'s memory, more especially because of the happy children itrepresented,  for these the little boy had seen in daylight.\"\\nManypass this picture by with  indifference, and yet it contains a treasureof poetic feeling; it represents Christ  descending into Hades.\"\\nTheyare not the lost whom the spectator sees, but the heathen  of oldentimes.\"\\nThe Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; mostbeautiful  is the expression on the face of the two children, whoappear to have full confidence  that they shall reach heaven at last.They are embracing each other, and one little  one stretches out hishand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself,  asif he were saying, \"I am going to heaven.\"\\n The older people stand asif uncertain,  yet hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to theLord Jesus.\"\\nOn this picture the  boy\\'s eyes rested longer than on anyother: the Metal Pig stood still before it.\"\\nA  low sigh was heard.Did it come from the picture or from the animal?\"\\nThe boy raised  hishands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off withhim through the  open vestibule.\"\\n \"Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,\" said the little boy,caressing the Metal  Pig as it ran down the steps.\"\\n \"Thanks to yourself also,\" replied the Metal Pig; \"I have helpedyou and you have helped  me, for it is only when I have an innocentchild on my back that I receive the power  to run.\"\\nYes; as you see, Ican even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of  the pictureof the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without,and  while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.Do not get down yet,  for if you do, then I shall be lifeless, as youhave seen me in the Porta Rosa.\"\\n  \"I will stay with you, my dear creature,\" said the little boy.So then they went on  at a rapid pace through the streets ofFlorence, till they came to the square before  the church of SantaCroce.\"\\nThe folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from  thealtar through the church into the deserted square.\"\\nA wonderful blazeof light  streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle,and a thousand moving stars  seemed to form a glory round it; eventhe coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and  a red ladder on a bluefield gleamed like fire.\"\\nIt was the grave of Galileo.\"\\nThe  monumentis unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art, signifyingthat the way  to glory leads up a shining ladder, on which the prophetsof mind rise to heaven, like  Elias of old.\"\\nIn the right aisle of thechurch every statue on the richly carved  sarcophagi seemed endowedwith life.\"\\nHere stood Michael Angelo; there Dante, with the  laurelwreath round his brow; Alfieri and Machiavelli; for here side byside rest the  great men- the pride of Italy.\"\\nThe church itself is verybeautiful, even more beautiful  than the marble cathedral atFlorence, though not so large.\"\\nIt seemed as if the carved  vestmentsstirred, and as if the marble figures they covered raised theirheads higher,  to gaze upon the brightly colored glowing altar wherethe white-robed boys swung the  golden censers, amid music and song,while the strong fragrance of incense filled the  church, andstreamed forth into the square.\"\\nThe boy stretched forth his handstowards  the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig startedagain so rapidly that he was  obliged to cling tightly to him.\"\\nThe windwhistled in his ears, he heard the church  door creak on its hingesas it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his  senses-then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.\"\\n It was morning; the Metal Pig stood in its old place on thePorta Rosa, and the boy  found he had slipped nearly off its back.\"\\nFearand trembling came upon him as he thought  of his mother; she hadsent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done  so, andnow he was hungry and thirsty.\"\\nOnce more he clasped the neck of hismetal horse,  kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it.\"\\nThen hewandered away into one of the  narrowest streets, where there wasscarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass.\"\\nA great  iron-bound doorstood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a brick staircase,with  dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till he came to anopen gallery hung with  rags.\"\\nFrom here a flight of steps led down to acourt, where from a well water was  drawn up by iron rollers to thedifferent stories of the house, and where the  water-buckets hungside by side.\"\\nSometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the  air,splashing the water all over the court.\"\\nAnother broken-downstaircase led from  the gallery, and two Russian sailors running downit almost upset the poor boy.\"\\nThey  were coming from their nightlycarousal.\"\\nA woman not very young, with an unpleasant  face and aquantity of black hair, followed them.\"\\n\"What have you brought home?\"\\nshe  asked.\"\\nwhen she saw the boy.\"\\n \"Don\\'t be angry,\" he pleaded; \"I received nothing, I havenothing at all;\" and he seized  his mother\\'s dress and would havekissed it.\"\\nThen they went into a little room.\"\\nI need  not describeit, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with handles,made  for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito.\"\\nThis pot shetook in her lap,  warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with herelbow.\"\\n \"Certainly you must have some money,\" she said.\"\\nThe boy began tocry, and then she  struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.\"\\n \"Will you be quiet?\"\\nor I\\'ll break your screaming head;\" and sheswung about the fire-pot  which she held in her hand, while the boycrouched to the earth and screamed.\"\\n Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under herarm.\"\\n\"Felicita,\" she said,  \"what are you doing to the child?\"\\n  \"The child is mine,\" she answered; \"I can murder him if I like,and you too, Giannina.\"\\n  And then she swung about the fire-pot.\"\\nTheother woman lifted up hers to defend herself,  and the two pots clashedtogether so violently that they were dashed to pieces, and  fire andashes flew about the room.\"\\nThe boy rushed out at the sight, spedacross the  courtyard, and fled from the house.\"\\nThe poor child ran tillhe was quite out of breath;  at last he stopped at the church, thedoors of which were opened to him the night before,  and went in.Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tombon  his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if hisheart would break.\"\\nPeople  came and went, mass was performed, but noone noticed the boy, excepting an elderly  citizen, who stood still andlooked at him for a moment, and then went away like the  rest.\"\\nHungerand thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.At  last he crept into a corner behind the marble monuments, and wentto sleep.\"\\nTowards  evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve;he started up, and the same old citizen  stood before him.\"\\n \"Are you ill?\"\\nwhere do you live?\"\\nhave you been here all day?\"\\n weresome of the questions  asked by the old man.\"\\nAfter hearing his answers,the old man took him home to a small  house close by, in a back street.They entered a glovemaker\\'s shop, where a woman sat  sewing busily.\"\\nAlittle white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin couldplainly  be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the boy.\"\\n \"Innocent souls are soon intimate,\" said the woman, as shecaressed both the boy and  the dog.\"\\nThese good people gave the childfood and drink, and said he should stay with  them all night, andthat the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go  andspeak to his mother.\"\\nA little homely bed was prepared for him, butto him who had  so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch,and he slept sweetly and dreamed  of the splendid pictures and of theMetal Pig.\"\\nGiuseppe went out the next morning,  and the poor childwas not glad to see him go, for he knew that the old man was gone  tohis mother, and that, perhaps, he would have to go back.\"\\nHe wept atthe thought,  and then he played with the little, lively dog, andkissed it, while the old woman  looked kindly at him to encouragehim.\"\\nAnd what news did Giuseppe bring back?\"\\nAt first  the boy could nothear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and she nodded andstroked  the boy\\'s cheek.\"\\n Then she said, \"He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, he maybecome a clever  glovemaker, like you.\"\\nLook what delicate fingers hehas got; Madonna intended him for  a glovemaker.\"\\n So the boy stayedwith them, and the woman herself taught him to sew;  and he ate well,and slept well, and became very merry.\"\\nBut at last he began to  teaseBellissima, as the little dog was called.\"\\nThis made the woman angry,and she  scolded him and threatened him, which made him very unhappy,and he went and sat in  his own room full of sad thoughts.\"\\nThis chamberlooked upon the street, in which hung  skins to dry, and there werethick iron bars across his window.\"\\nThat night he lay awake,  thinkingof the Metal Pig; indeed, it was always in his thoughts.\"\\nSuddenly hefancied  he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat.\"\\nHe sprung out of bedand went to the window.\"\\n Could it be the Metal Pig?\"\\nBut there wasnothing to be seen; whatever he had heard  had passed already.\"\\nNextmorning, their neighbor, the artist, passed by, carrying a  paint-boxand a large roll of canvas.\"\\n \"Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors,\" said the woman tothe boy; and he  obeyed instantly, took the box, and followed thepainter.\"\\nThey walked on till they  reached the picture gallery, andmounted the same staircase up which he had ridden  that night on theMetal Pig.\"\\nHe remembered all the statues and pictures, the  beautifulmarble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with the Saviourand St.\"\\n John.\"\\nThey stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in whichChrist is represented as  standing in the lower world, with thechildren smiling before Him, in the sweet  expectation of enteringheaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.\"\\n \"You may go home now,\" said the painter, while the boy stoodwatching him, till he  had set up his easel.\"\\n \"May I see you paint?\"\\n asked the boy; \"may I see you put thepicture on this white  canvas?\"\\n  \"I am not going to paint yet,\" replied the artist; then he broughtout a piece of chalk.\"\\n His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured thegreat picture; and though nothing  appeared but a faint line, thefigure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the  coloredpicture.\"\\n \"Why don\\'t you go?\"\\n said the painter.\"\\nThen the boy wandered homesilently, and seated  himself on the table, and learned to sewgloves.\"\\nBut all day long his thoughts were  in the picture gallery; andso he pricked his fingers and was awkward.\"\\nBut he did not  teaseBellissima.\"\\nWhen evening came, and the house door stood open, heslipped out.\"\\n It was a bright, beautiful, starlight evening, but rathercold.\"\\nAway he went through  the already-deserted streets, and soon cameto the Metal Pig; he stooped down and  kissed its shining nose, andthen seated himself on its back.\"\\n \"You happy creature,\" he said; \"how I have longed for you!\"\\nwe musttake a ride  to-night.\"\\n  But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushedforth from its mouth.\"\\n The little boy still sat astride on its back,when he felt something pulling at his  clothes.\"\\nHe looked down, andthere was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima,  barking as ifshe would have said, \"Here I am too; why are you sitting there?\"\\n  A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much asdid the little dog  in this place.\"\\n\"Bellissima in the street, and notdressed!\"\\n as the old lady called  it; \"what would be the end of this?\"\\n  The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in alittle lambskin coat  which had been made for her; it was fastenedround the little dog\\'s neck and body with  red ribbons, and wasdecorated with rosettes and little bells.\"\\nThe dog looked almost  like alittle kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and trot afterher mistress.\"\\n And now here she was in the cold, and not dressed.\"\\nOh,how would it end?\"\\nAll his fancies  were quickly put to flight; yet hekissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took  Bellissima in hisarms.\"\\nThe poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy  ranhomeward as fast as he could.\"\\n \"What are you running away with there?\"\\n asked two of the policewhom he met, and at  whom the dog barked.\"\\n\"Where have you stolen thatpretty dog?\"\\n they asked; and they  took it away from him.\"\\n \"Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again,\" cried theboy, despairingly.\"\\n \"If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they can sendto the watch-house  for the dog.\"\\n Then they told him where thewatch-house was, and went away with  Bellissima.\"\\n Here was a dreadful trouble.\"\\nThe boy did not know whether he hadbetter jump into the  Arno, or go home and confess everything.\"\\nTheywould certainly kill him, he thought.\"\\n \"Well, I would gladly be killed,\" he reasoned; \"for then I shalldie, and go to heaven:\"  and so he went home, almost hoping for death.\"\\n The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.\"\\nNo onewas in the street;  so he took up a stone, and with it made atremendous noise at the door.\"\\n \"Who is there?\"\\n asked somebody from within.\"\\n \"It is I,\" said he.\"\\n\"Bellissima is gone.\"\\nOpen the door, and thenkill me.\"\\n  Then indeed there was a great panic.\"\\nMadame was so very fond ofBellissima.\"\\nShe  immediately looked at the wall where the dog\\'s dressusually hung; and there was the  little lambskin.\"\\n \"Bellissima in the watch-house!\"\\n she cried.\"\\n\"You bad boy!\"\\nhowdid you entice her out?\"\\n Poor little delicate thing, with those roughpolicemen!\"\\nand she\\'ll be frozen with  cold.\"\\n  Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boywept.\"\\nSeveral of the  neighbors came in, and amongst them thepainter.\"\\nHe took the boy between his knees,  and questioned him; and,in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also  about theMetal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery, which wascertainly  rather incomprehensible.\"\\nThe painter, however, consoledthe little fellow, and tried  to soften the lady\\'s anger; but she wouldnot be pacified till her husband returned  with Bellissima, who hadbeen with the police.\"\\nThen there was great rejoicing, and  thepainter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.\"\\nOh,what beautiful  pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and,above all, the Metal Pig was there  too.\"\\nOh, nothing could be moredelightful.\"\\nBy means of a few strokes, it was made to  appear on thepaper; and even the house that stood behind it had been sketched in.Oh,  if he could only draw and paint!\"\\nHe who could do this couldconjure all the world before  him.\"\\nThe first leisure moment duringthe next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the  back of one of theother drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig,and  he succeeded.\"\\nCertainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down,one leg thick, and  another thin; still it was like the copy, and hewas overjoyed at what he had done.\"\\n The pencil would not go quite as itought,- he had found that out; but the next day  he tried again.\"\\nAsecond pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked ahundred  times better; and the third attempt was so good, thateverybody might know what it  was meant to represent.\"\\n And now the glovemaking went on but slowly.\"\\nThe orders given bythe shops in the town  were not finished quickly; for the Metal Pig hadtaught the boy that all objects may  be drawn upon paper; andFlorence is a picture-book in itself for any one who chooses  to turnover its pages.\"\\nOn the Piazza dell Trinita stands a slender pillar,and upon  it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded, with her scales inher hand.\"\\nShe was soon  represented on paper, and it was theglovemaker\\'s boy who placed her there.\"\\nHis  collection of picturesincreased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless  objects,when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: \"Stand still,\"cried he,  \"and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst mycollection.\"\\n  But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound fast inone position.\"\\nHe  tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped,and so pulled and tightened the  string, that she was nearly strangled;and just then her mistress walked in.\"\\n \"You wicked boy!\"\\nthe poor little creature!\"\\n was all she couldutter.\"\\n She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, calledhim a most ungrateful,  good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade himto enter the house again.\"\\nThen she wept,  and kissed her littlehalf-strangled Bellissima.\"\\nAt this moment the painter entered  theroom.\"\\n *  *  *  *  *  *  *  In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of Arts atFlorence.\"\\nTwo  pictures, placed side by side, attracted a largenumber of spectators.\"\\nThe smaller  of the two represented a littleboy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little  white poodle,curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it had  beenfastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in oneposition.\"\\nThe  truthfulness and life in this picture interested everyone.\"\\nThe painter was said to  be a young Florentine, who had been foundin the streets, when a child, by an old  glovemaker, who had broughthim up.\"\\nThe boy had taught himself to draw: it was also  said that ayoung artist, now famous, had discovered talent in the child just ashe  was about to be sent away for having tied up madame\\'s favoritelittle dog, and using  it as a model.\"\\nThe glovemaker\\'s boy had alsobecome a great painter, as the picture  proved; but the largerpicture by its side was a still greater proof of his talent.\"\\n Itrepresented a handsome boy, clothed in rags, lying asleep, and leaningagainst the  Metal Pig in the street of the Porta Rosa.\"\\nAll thespectators knew the spot well.\"\\nThe  child\\'s arms were round the neck ofthe Pig, and he was in a deep sleep.\"\\nThe lamp before  the picture ofthe Madonna threw a strong, effective light on the pale, delicate faceof  the child.\"\\nIt was a beautiful picture.\"\\nA large gilt framesurrounded it, and on one  corner of the frame a laurel wreath had beenhung; but a black band, twined unseen  among the green leaves, and astreamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the  last few days theyoung artist had- died.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE MONEY-BOX  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, amoney-box stood on the top  of a very high wardrobe.\"\\nIt was made ofclay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought  of the potter.\"\\nInthe back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with  aknife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through; and,indeed there were  two in the box, besides a number of pence.\"\\nThemoney-pig was stuffed so full that it  could no longer rattle, which isthe highest state of perfection to which a money-pig  can attain.\"\\nTherehe stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down  uponeverything else in the room.\"\\nHe knew very well that he had enoughinside him to  buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very goodopinion of his own value.\"\\n The rest thought of this fact also, althoughthey did not express it, for there were  so many other things to talkabout.\"\\nA large doll, still handsome, though rather old,  for her neckhad been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partlyopen.\"\\nShe  called out to the others, \"Let us have a game at being menand women, that is something  worth playing at.\"\\n  Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, whichhung in frames on the  wall, turned round in their excitement, andshowed that they had a wrong side to them,  although they had not theleast intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object  tothe game.\"\\nIt was late at night, but as the moon shone through thewindows, they had  light at a cheap rate.\"\\nAnd as the game was now tobegin, all were invited to take part  in it, even the children\\'s wagon,which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings.\"\\n \"Each has itsown value,\" said the wagon; \"we cannot all be noblemen; there mustbe  some to do the work.\"\\n  The money-pig was the only one who received a writteninvitation.\"\\nHe stood so high  that they were afraid he would not accepta verbal message.\"\\nBut in his reply, he said,  if he had to take a part,he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange  forhim to do so; and so they did.\"\\nThe little toy theatre was thereforeput up in such  a way that the money-pig could look directly into it.Some wanted to begin with a comedy,  and afterwards to have a tea partyand a discussion for mental improvement, but they  commenced with thelatter first.\"\\nThe rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the  wagonof railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each oftheir  professions, and it was right they should talk of them.\"\\nTheclock talked politics-  \"tick, tick;\" he professed to know what was thetime of day, but there was a whisper  that he did not go correctly.\"\\nThebamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he  was vain of hisbrass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked  cushions,pretty but stupid.\"\\nWhen the play at the little theatre began, the restsat  and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack,when they felt  gratified with what they saw.\"\\nBut the riding-whipsaid he never cracked for old people,  only for the young who werenot yet married.\"\\n\"I crack for everybody,\" said the cracker.\"\\n \"Yes, and a fine noise you make,\" thought the audience, as theplay went on.\"\\n It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all thecharacters turned their  painted sides to the audience, for they weremade only to be seen on one side.\"\\nThe  acting was wonderful,excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because  thewires were a little too long.\"\\nThe doll, whose neck had been darned,was so excited  that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pigdeclared he must do something for  one of the players, as they hadall pleased him so much.\"\\nSo he made up his mind to  remember one ofthem in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the familyvault,  whenever that event should happen.\"\\nThey all enjoyed thecomedy so much, that they gave  up all thoughts of the tea party, andonly carried out their idea of intellectual  amusement, which theycalled playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong  about it,for it was only play.\"\\nAll the while, each one thought most of himself,or  of what the money-pig could be thinking.\"\\nHis thoughts were on, ashe supposed, a very  distant time- of making his will, and of hisburial, and of when it might all come  to pass.\"\\nCertainly sooner thanhe expected- for all at once down he came from the top  of the press,fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces.\"\\nThen the pennieshopped  and danced about in the most amusing manner.\"\\nThe little onestwirled round like tops,  and the large ones rolled away as far as theycould, especially the one great silver  crown piece who had often to goout into the world, and now he had his wish as well  as all the rest ofthe money.\"\\nThe pieces of the money-pig were thrown into thedust-bin,  and the next day there stood a new money-pig on thecupboard, but it had not a farthing  in its inside yet, andtherefore, like the old one, it could not rattle.\"\\nThis was  thebeginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE NEIGHBOURING FAMILIES  by Hans Christian Andersen  ONE would have thought that something important was going on inthe duck-pond, but  it was nothing after all.\"\\nAll the ducks lyingquietly on the water or standing on their  heads in it- for theycould do that- at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their  feetwere seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide.The water,  which a few moments before had been as clear and smoothas a mirror, became very  troubled.\"\\nBefore, every tree, everyneighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the  holes in the roof andthe swallows\\' nest, and especially the great rose-bush full  offlowers, had been reflected in it.\"\\nThe rose-bush covered the walland hung out over  the water, in which everything was seen as if in apicture, except that it all stood  on its head; but when the waterwas troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture  was gone.\"\\nTwofeathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down;suddenly  they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it didnot come they had to lie  still, and the water once more became quietand smooth.\"\\nThe roses were again reflected;  they were verybeautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them.\"\\nThe  sunshone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth theloveliest fragrance,  and all felt as we do when we are filled with joyat the thought of our happiness.\"\\n \"How beautiful existence is!\"\\n said each rose.\"\\n\"The only thing thatI wish for is to  be able to kiss the sun, because it is so warm andbright.\"\\nI should also like to kiss  those roses down in the water,which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds  down in thenest.\"\\nThere are some up above too; they put out their heads and pipesoftly;  they have no feathers like their father and mother.\"\\nWe havegood neighbours, both below  and above.\"\\nHow beautiful existence is!\"\\n  The young ones above and below- those below were really onlyshadows in the water\\ufffewere sparrows; their parents were sparrowstoo, and had taken possession of the empty  swallows\\' nest of lastyear, and now lived in it as if it were their own property.\"\\n \"Are those the duck\\'s children swimming here?\"\\n asked the youngsparrows when they saw  the feathers on the water.\"\\n \"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones,\" said their mother.\"\\nDon\\'t you see that  they are feathers, such as I wear and you willwear too?\"\\nBut ours are finer.\"\\nStill,  I should like to have them upin the nest, for they keep one warm.\"\\nI am very curious  to know whatthe ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, althoughI did  say \\'peep\\' to you pretty loudly.\"\\nThe thick-headed roses ought toknow why, but they  know nothing at all; they only look at themselvesand smell.\"\\nI am heartily tired of  such neighbours.\"\\n  \"Listen to the dear little birds up there,\" said the roses;\"they begin to want to  sing too, but are not able to manage it yet.But it will soon come.\"\\nWhat a pleasure  that must be!\"\\nIt is fine tohave such cheerful neighbours.\"\\n  Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered.\"\\nA peasant boyrode on one, and  he had taken off all his clothes except his largebroad black hat.\"\\nThe boy whistled  like a bird, and rode into thepond where it was deepest, and as he passed the rose-bush  he plucked arose and stuck it in his hat.\"\\nNow he looked dressed, and rode on.The other  roses looked after their sister, and asked each other,\"Where can she be going to?\"\\n  But none of them knew.\"\\n \"I should like to go out into the world for once,\" said one;\"but here at home among  our green leaves it is beautiful too.\"\\nThewhole day long the sun shines bright and  warm, and in the night thesky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through  all thelittle holes in it.\"\\n  They meant the stars, but they knew no better.\"\\n \"We make it lively about the house,\" said the sparrow-mother; \"andpeople say that  a swallows\\' nest brings luck; so they are glad ofus.\"\\nBut such neighbours as ours!\"\\n A rose-bush on the wall like thatcauses damp.\"\\nI daresay it will be taken away; then  we shall,perhaps, have some corn growing here.\"\\nThe roses are good for nothingbut to  be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in ahat.\"\\nEvery year, as I have  been told by my mother, they fall off.The farmer\\'s wife preserves them and strews  salt among them; then theyget a French name which I neither can pronounce nor care  to, and areput into the fire to make a nice smell.\"\\nYou see, that\\'s their life;they  exist only for the eye and the nose.\"\\nNow you know.\"\\n  In the evening, when the gnats were playing about in the warmair and in the red clouds,  the nightingale came and sang to theroses that the beautiful was like sunshine to  the world, and thatthe beautiful lived for ever.\"\\nThe roses thought that the  nightingalewas singing about itself, and that one might easily have believed;they  had no idea that the song was about them.\"\\nBut they were verypleased with it, and  wondered whether all the little sparrows couldbecome nightingales.\"\\n \"I understand the song of that bird very well,\" said the youngsparrows.\"\\n\"There was  only one word that was not clear to me.\"\\nWhat does\\'the beautiful\\' mean?\"\\n  \"Nothing at all,\" answered their mother; \"that\\'s only somethingexternal.\"\\nUp at the  Hall, where the pigeons have their own house,and corn and peas are strewn before them  every day- I have dinedwith them myself, and that you shall do in time, too; for tell  me whatcompany you keep and I\\'ll tell you who you are- up at the Hall theyhave two  birds with green necks and a crest upon their heads; they canspread out their tails  like a great wheel, and these are so brightwith various colours that it makes one\\'s  eyes ache.\"\\nThese birds arecalled peacocks, and that is \\'the beautiful.\\' If they were  onlyplucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.\"\\nIwould have plucked  them already if they had not been so big.\"\\n  \"I\\'ll pluck them,\" piped the young sparrow, who had no feathersyet.\"\\n In the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved eachother dearly, were  industrious and active, and everything in theirhome looked very nice.\"\\nOn Sundays the  young wife came down early,plucked a handful of the most beautiful roses, and put  them into aglass of water, which she placed upon the cupboard.\"\\n \"Now I see that it is Sunday,\" said the husband, kissing hislittle wife.\"\\nThey sat  down, read their hymn-book, and held eachother by the hand, while the sun shone down  upon the fresh roses andupon them.\"\\n \"This sight is really too tedious,\" said the sparrow-mother, whocould see into the  room from her nest; and she flew away.\"\\n The same thing happened on the following Sunday, for everySunday fresh roses were  put into the glass; but the rose-bushbloomed as beautifully as ever.\"\\nThe young  sparrows now had feathers,and wanted very much to fly with their mother; but she would  not allowit, and so they had to stay at home.\"\\nIn one of her flights, however itmay  have happened, she was caught, before she was aware of it, in ahorse-hair net which  some boys had attached to a tree.\"\\nThehorse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as  tightly as if thelatter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.\"\\nTheboys  came running up and seized her, and in no gentle way either.\"\\n \"It\\'s only a sparrow,\" they said; they did not, however, let hergo, but took her home  with them, and every time she cried they hit heron the beak.\"\\n In the farmhouse was an old man who understood making soap intocakes and balls, both  for shaving and washing.\"\\nHe was a merry old man,always wandering about.\"\\nOn seeing  the sparrow which the boys hadbrought, and which they said they did not want, he asked,  \"Shall wemake it look very pretty?\"\\n  At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.\"\\n Out of his box, in which were the most beautiful colours, theold man took a quantity  of shining leaf-gold, while the boys had to goand fetch some white of egg, with which  the sparrow was to besmeared all over; the gold was stuck on to this, and  thesparrow-mother was now gilded all over.\"\\nBut she, trembling in everylimb, did not  think of the adornment.\"\\nThen the soap-man tore off asmall piece from the red lining  of his old jacket, and cutting it soas to make it look like a cock\\'s comb, he stuck  it to the bird\\'s head.\"\\n \"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly,\" said the old man,letting the sparrow go, which  flew away in deadly fear, with the sunshining upon her.\"\\nHow she glittered!\"\\nAll the  sparrows, and even acrow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but  stillthey flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.\"\\n Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almostsinking fainting to the  earth, while the flock of pursuing birdsincreased, some even attempting to peck at  her.\"\\n \"Look at her!\"\\nLook at her!\"\\n they all cried.\"\\n \"Look at her!\"\\nLook at her\" cried her little ones.\"\\nas sheapproached the nest.\"\\n\"That  is certainly a young peacock, for itglitters in all colours; it makes one\\'s eyes ache,  as mother toldus.\"\\nPeep!\"\\nthat\\'s \\'the beautiful\\'.\"\\n And then they pecked at the birdwith  their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to getinto the nest; she was  so exhausted that she couldn\\'t even say \"Peep!\"\\nmuch less \"I am your own mother!\"\\n The  other birds, too, now fellupon the sparrow and plucked off feather after feather until  shefell bleeding into the rose-bush.\"\\n \"Poor creature!\"\\n said all the roses; \"only be still, and we willhide you.\"\\nLean your  little head against us.\"\\n The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closelyto her, and lay  dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful freshroses.\"\\n \"Peep!\"\\n sounded from the nest.\"\\n\"Where can mother be so long?It\\'s more than I can  understand.\"\\nIt cannot be a trick of hers, andmean that we are now to take care of  ourselves.\"\\nShe has left us thehouse as an inheritance; but to which of us is it to  belong when wehave families of our own?\"\\n  \"Yes, it won\\'t do for you to stay with me when I increase myhousehold with a wife  and children,\"\\' said the smallest.\"\\n \"I daresay I shall have more wives and children than you,\" saidthe second.\"\\n \"But I am the eldest!\"\\n exclaimed the third.\"\\nThen they all gotexcited; they hit out  with their wings, pecked with their beaks, andflop!\"\\none after another was thrown out  of the nest.\"\\nThere they laywith their anger, holding their heads on one side and  blinking the eyethat was turned upwards.\"\\nThat was their way of looking foolish.\"\\n They could fly a little; by practice they learned to improve,and at last they agreed  upon a sign by which to recognise each otherif they should meet in the world later  on.\"\\nIt was to be one \"Peep!\"\\nand three scratches on the ground with the left foot.\"\\n The young one who had remained behind in the nest made himselfas broad as he could,  for he was the proprietor.\"\\nBut this greatnessdid not last long.\"\\nIn the night the red  flames burst through thewindow and seized the roof, the dry straw blazed up high,  and thewhole house, together with the young sparrow, was burned.\"\\nThe twoothers, who  wanted to marry, thus saved their lives by a stroke ofluck.\"\\n When the sun rose again and everything looked as refreshed as ifit had had a quiet  sleep, there only remained of the farmhouse a fewblack charred beams leaning against  the chimney, which was now its ownmaster.\"\\nThick smoke still rose from the ruins, but  the rose-bush stoodyonder, fresh, blooming, and untouched, every flower and every  twigbeing reflected in the clear water.\"\\n \"How beautifully the roses bloom before the ruined house,\"exclaimed a passer-by.\"\\n\"A  pleasanter picture cannot be imagined.\"\\nImust have that.\"\\n And the man took out of his  portfolio a little bookwith white leaves: he was a painter, and with his pencil he  drew thesmoking house, the charred beams and the overhanging chimney, whichbent more  and more; in the foreground he put the large, bloomingrose-bush, which presented a  charming view.\"\\nFor its sake alone thewhole picture had been drawn.\"\\n Later in the day the two sparrows who had been born there came by.\"\\nWhere is the house?\"\\n  they asked.\"\\n\"Where is the nest?\"\\nPeep!\"\\nAll isburned and our strong brother too.\"\\nThat\\'s  what he has now forkeeping the nest.\"\\nThe roses got off very well; there they stillstand  with their red cheeks.\"\\nThey certainly do not mourn at theirneighbours\\' misfortunes.\"\\n I don\\'t want to talk to them, and it looksmiserable here- that\\'s my opinion.\"\\n And  away they went.\"\\n On a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed itwas still the middle  of summer- there hopped about in the dryclean-swept courtyard before the principal  entrance of the Hall anumber of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining  in thesunlight.\"\\nThe pigeon-mothers said to their young ones: \"Stand ingroups, stand  in groups!\"\\nfor that looks much better.\"\\n  \"What kind of creatures are those little grey ones that runabout behind us?\"\\n asked  an old pigeon, with red and green in her eyes.\"\\nLittle grey ones!\"\\nLittle grey ones!\"\\n  she cried.\"\\n \"They are sparrows, and good creatures.\"\\nWe have always had thereputation of being  pious, so we will allow them to pick up the cornwith us; they don\\'t interrupt our  talk, and they scrape so prettilywhen they bow.\"\\n  Indeed they were continually making three foot-scrapings withthe left foot and also  said \"Peep!\"\\n By this means they recognised eachother, for they were the sparrows from  the nest on the burned house.\"\\n \"Here is excellent fare!\"\\n said the sparrow.\"\\nThe pigeons struttedround one another,  puffed out their chests mightily, and had their ownprivate views and opinions.\"\\n \"Do you see that pouter pigeon?\"\\n said one to the other.\"\\n\"Do yousee how she swallows  the peas?\"\\nShe eats too many, and the best onestoo.\"\\nCuroo!\"\\nCuroo!\"\\nHow she lifts her  crest, the ugly, spitefulcreature!\"\\nCuroo!\"\\nCuroo!\"\\n And the eyes of all sparkled with  malice.\"\\nStand in groups!\"\\nStand in groups!\"\\nLittle grey ones, little grey ones!Curoo,  curoo, curoo!\"\\n  So their chatter ran on, and so it will run on for thousands ofyears.\"\\nThe sparrows  ate lustily; they listened attentively, and evenstood in the ranks with the others,  but it did not suit them at all.They were full, and so they left the pigeons, exchanging  opinionsabout them, slipped in under the garden palings, and when they foundthe door  leading into the house open, one of them, who was more thanfull, and therefore felt  brave, hopped on to the threshold.\"\\n\"Peep!\"\\nsaid he; \"I may venture that.\"\\n  \"Peep!\"\\n said the other; \"so may I, and something more too!\"\\n and hehopped into the  room.\"\\nNo one was there; the third sparrow, seeingthis, flew still farther into the  room, exclaiming, \"All or nothing!It is a curious man\\'s nest all the same; and what  have they put uphere?\"\\nWhat is it?\"\\n  Close to the sparrows the roses were blooming; they were reflectedin the water, and  the charred beams leaned against the overhangingchimney.\"\\n\"Do tell me what this is.\"\\n How comes this in a room at theHall?\"\\n And all three sparrows wanted to fly over the  roses and thechimney, but flew against a flat wall.\"\\nIt was all a picture, a  greatsplendid picture, which the artist had painted from a sketch.\"\\n \"Peep!\"\\n said the sparrows, \"it\\'s nothing.\"\\nIt only looks likesomething.\"\\nPeep!\"\\nthat  is \\'the beautiful.\\' Do you understand it?\"\\nIdon\\'t.\"\\n  And they flew away, for some people came into the room.\"\\n Days and years went by.\"\\nThe pigeons had often cooed, not to saygrowled- the spiteful  creatures; the sparrows had been frozen inwinter and had lived merrily in summer:  they were all betrothed, ormarried, or whatever you like to call it.\"\\nThey had little  ones, and ofcourse each one thought his own the handsomest and cleverest; one flewthis  way, another that, and when they met they recognised each otherby their \"Peep!\"\\n and  the three scrapes with the left foot.\"\\nTheeldest had remained an old maid and had no  nest nor young ones.\"\\nIt washer pet idea to see a great city, so she flew to Copenhagen.\"\\n There was a large house painted in many gay colours standing closeto the castle and  the canal, upon which latter were to be seen manyships laden with apples and pottery.\"\\n The windows of the house werebroader at the bottom than at the top, and when the  sparrows lookedthrough them, every room appeared to them like a tulip with  thebrightest colours and shades.\"\\nBut in the middle of the tulip stoodwhite men, made  of marble; a few were of plaster; still, looked atwith sparrows\\' eyes, that comes  to the same thing.\"\\nUp on the roofstood a metal chariot drawn by metal horses, and  the goddess ofVictory, also of metal, was driving.\"\\nIt was Thorwaldsen\\'s Museum.\"\\n \"How it shines!\"\\nhow it shines!\"\\n said the maiden sparrow.\"\\n\"Isuppose that is \\'the  beautiful.\\' Peep!\"\\nBut here it is larger than apeacock.\"\\n She still remembered what  in her childhood\\'s days her motherhad looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful.\"\\n She flew downinto the courtyard: there everything was extremely fine.\"\\nPalms  andbranches were painted on the walls, and in the middle of the courtstood a great  blooming rose-tree spreading out its fresh boughs,covered with roses, over a grave.\"\\n Thither flew the maiden sparrow, forshe saw several of her own kind there.\"\\nA \"peep\"  and threefoot-scrapings- in this way she had often greeted throughout the year,and  no one here had responded, for those who are once parted do notmeet every day; and  so this greeting had become a habit with her.But to-day two old sparrows and a young  one answered with a \"peep\" andthe thrice-repeated scrape with the left foot.\"\\n \"Ah!\"\\nGood-day!\"\\ngood-day!\"\\n They were two old ones from the nest anda little one of  the family.\"\\n\"Do we meet here?\"\\nIt\\'s a grand place,but there\\'s not much to eat.\"\\nThis  is \\'the beautiful.\\' Peep!\"\\n  Many people came out of the side rooms where the beautifulmarble statues stood and  approached the grave where lay the greatmaster who had created these works of art.\"\\n All stood with enrapturedfaces round Thorwaldsen\\'s grave, and a few picked up the  fallenrose-leaves and preserved them.\"\\nThey had come from afar: one frommighty England,  others from Germany and France.\"\\nThe fairest of theladies plucked one of the roses  and hid it in her bosom.\"\\nThen thesparrows thought that the roses reigned here, and  that the house hadbeen built for their sake.\"\\nThat appeared to them to be really toomuch,  but since all the people showed their love for the roses, theydid not wish to be  behindhand.\"\\n\"Peep!\"\\n they said sweeping the groundwith their tails, and blinking with  one eye at the roses, they had notlooked at them long before they were convinced that  they were theirold neighbours.\"\\nAnd so they really were.\"\\nThe painter who had drawn  therose-bush near the ruined house, had afterwards obtained permission todig it up,  and had given it to the architect, for finer roses hadnever been seen.\"\\nThe architect  had planted it upon Thorwaldsen\\'sgrave, where it bloomed as an emblem of \\'the  beautiful\\' and yieldedfragrant red rose-leaves to be carried as mementoes to distant  lands.\"\\n \"Have you obtained an appointment here in the city?\"\\n asked thesparrows.\"\\nThe roses  nodded; they recognized their grey neighboursand were pleased to see them again.\"\\n\"How  glorious it is to live and tobloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces every  day.\"\\nIt is asif every day were a festival.\"\\n \"Peep!\"\\n said the sparrows.\"\\n\"Yes, theyare  really our old neighbours; we remember their origin near the pond.Peep!\"\\nhow they have  got on.\"\\nYes, some succeed while they are asleep.Ah!\"\\nthere\\'s a faded leaf; I can see  that quite plainly.\"\\n And theypecked at it till it fell off.\"\\nBut the tree stood there  fresher andgreener than ever; the roses bloomed in the sunshine onThorwaldsen\\'s grave  and became associated with his immortal name.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE NIGHTINGALE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN China, you know, the emperor is a Chinese, and all thoseabout him are Chinamen  also.\"\\nThe story I am going to tell you happeneda great many years ago, so it is well  to hear it now before it isforgotten.\"\\nThe emperor\\'s palace was the most beautiful  in the world.It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicateand  brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful.\"\\nInthe garden could be seen  the most singular flowers, with pretty silverbells tied to them, which tinkled so  that every one who passed couldnot help noticing the flowers.\"\\nIndeed, everything in  the emperor\\'sgarden was remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardenerhimself  did not know where it ended.\"\\nThose who travelled beyond itslimits knew that there  was a noble forest, with lofty trees, slopingdown to the deep blue sea, and the great  ships sailed under the shadowof its branches.\"\\nIn one of these trees lived a nightingale,  who sangso beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so many otherthings to  do, would stop and listen.\"\\nSometimes, when they went atnight to spread their nets,  they would hear her sing, and say, \"Oh, isnot that beautiful?\"\\n But when they returned  to their fishing, theyforgot the bird until the next night.\"\\nThen they would hear it  again,and exclaim \"Oh, how beautiful is the nightingale\\'s song!\"\\n  Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of theemperor, which they  admired very much, as well as the palace andgardens; but when they heard the  nightingale, they all declared itto be the best of all.\"\\nAnd the travellers, on their  return home,related what they had seen; and learned men wrote books,  containingdescriptions of the town, the palace, and the gardens; but they didnot  forget the nightingale, which was really the greatest wonder.And those who could write  poetry composed beautiful verses about thenightingale, who lived in a forest near  the deep sea.\"\\nThe bookstravelled all over the world, and some of them came into the  handsof the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, henodded his  approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such abeautiful description of his  city, his palace, and his gardens.\"\\nButwhen he came to the words, \"the nightingale  is the most beautiful ofall,\" he exclaimed, \"What is this?\"\\nI know nothing of  anynightingale.\"\\nIs there such a bird in my empire?\"\\nand even in my garden?I have never  heard of it.\"\\nSomething, it appears, may be learnt frombooks.\"\\n  Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was sohigh-bred, that when any in  an inferior rank to himself spoke tohim, or asked him a question, he would answer,  \"Pooh,\" which meansnothing.\"\\n \"There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here, called anightingale,\" said the emperor;  \"they say it is the best thing in mylarge kingdom.\"\\nWhy have I not been told of it?\"\\n  \"I have never heard the name,\" replied the cavalier; \"she hasnot been presented at  court.\"\\n  \"It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening.\"\\n said theemperor; the whole  world knows what I possess better than I domyself.\"\\n  \"I have never heard of her,\" said the cavalier; \"yet I willendeavor to find her.\"\\n  But where was the nightingale to be found?\"\\nThe nobleman went upstairs and down, through  halls and passages; yet none of those whom hemet had heard of the bird.\"\\nSo he returned  to the emperor, and saidthat it must be a fable, invented by those who had written  the book.\"\\nYour imperial majesty,\" said he, \"cannot believe everything containedin  books; sometimes they are only fiction, or what is called the blackart.\"\\n  \"But the book in which I have read this account,\" said theemperor, \"was sent to me  by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, andtherefore it cannot contain a falsehood.\"\\n I will hear thenightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highestfavor;  and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampledupon after supper is ended.\"\\n  \"Tsing-pe!\"\\n cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he ran up anddown stairs, through  all the halls and corridors; and half the courtran with him, for they did not like  the idea of being trampled upon.There was a great inquiry about this wonderful  nightingale, whom allthe world knew, but who was unknown to the court.\"\\n At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said,\"Oh, yes, I know  the nightingale quite well; indeed, she can sing.Every evening I have permission to  take home to my poor sick motherthe scraps from the table; she lives down by the  sea-shore, and as Icome back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and  listento the nightingale\\'s song.\"\\nThen the tears come into my eyes, and it isjust as  if my mother kissed me.\"\\n  \"Little maiden,\" said the lord-in-waiting, \"I will obtain foryou constant employment  in the kitchen, and you shall havepermission to see the emperor dine, if you will  lead us to thenightingale; for she is invited for this evening to the palace.\"\\n Soshe  went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half thecourt followed her.\"\\nAs  they went along, a cow began lowing.\"\\n \"Oh,\" said a young courtier, \"now we have found her; whatwonderful power for such  a small creature; I have certainly heard itbefore.\"\\n  \"No, that is only a cow lowing,\" said the little girl; \"we are along way from the  place yet.\"\\n  Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.\"\\n \"Beautiful,\" said the young courtier again.\"\\n\"Now I hear it,tinkling like little church  bells.\"\\n  \"No, those are frogs,\" said the little maiden; \"but I think weshall soon hear her  now:\" and presently the nightingale began to sing.\"\\n \"Hark, hark!\"\\nthere she is,\" said the girl, \"and there she sits,\"she added, pointing  to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough.\"\\n \"Is it possible?\"\\n said the lord-in-waiting, \"I never imagined itwould be a little,  plain, simple thing like that.\"\\nShe has certainlychanged color at seeing so many grand  people around her.\"\\n  \"Little nightingale,\" cried the girl, raising her voice, \"our mostgracious emperor  wishes you to sing before him.\"\\n  \"With the greatest pleasure,\" said the nightingale, and began tosing most  delightfully.\"\\n \"It sounds like tiny glass bells,\" said the lord-in-waiting,\"and see how her little  throat works.\"\\nIt is surprising that we havenever heard this before; she will be a  great success at court.\"\\n  \"Shall I sing once more before the emperor?\"\\n asked thenightingale, who thought he  was present.\"\\n \"My excellent little nightingale,\" said the courtier, \"I havethe great pleasure of  inviting you to a court festival this evening,where you will gain imperial favor by  your charming song.\"\\n  \"My song sounds best in the green wood,\" said the bird; butstill she came willingly  when she heard the emperor\\'s wish.\"\\n The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion.\"\\nThe walls andfloors of porcelain  glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.Beautiful flowers, round which little bells  were tied, stood in thecorridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught,  thesebells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.\"\\nIn thecentre of  the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for thenightingale to sit on.\"\\nThe whole  court was present, and the littlekitchen-maid had received permission to stand by  the door.\"\\nShe was notinstalled as a real court cook.\"\\nAll were in full dress, and  everyeye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded toher to begin.\"\\n The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came intothe emperor\\'s eyes, and then  rolled down his cheeks, as her songbecame still more touching and went to every one\\'s  heart.\"\\nTheemperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale shouldhave his  gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined thehonor with thanks: she had  been sufficiently rewarded already.\"\\n\"I haveseen tears in an emperor\\'s eyes,\" she said,  \"that is my richestreward.\"\\nAn emperor\\'s tears have wonderful power, and are  quitesufficient honor for me;\" and then she sang again more enchantinglythan ever.\"\\n \"That singing is a lovely gift;\" said the ladies of the court toeach other; and then  they took water in their mouths to make themutter the gurgling sounds of the  nightingale when they spoke to anyone, so thay they might fancy themselves  nightingales.\"\\nAnd the footmenand chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction,  which is sayinga great deal, for they are very difficult to please.\"\\nIn fact  thenightingale\\'s visit was most successful.\"\\nShe was now to remain atcourt, to have  her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, andonce during the night.\"\\nTwelve  servants were appointed to attend her onthese occasions, who each held her by a silken  string fastened toher leg.\"\\nThere was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of  flying.\"\\n The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two peoplemet, one said \"nightin,\"  and the other said \"gale,\" and theyunderstood what was meant, for nothing else was  talked of.\"\\nElevenpeddlers\\' children were named after her, but not of them could singa  note.\"\\n One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written\"The Nightingale.\"\\n  \"Here is no doubt a new book about our celebratedbird,\" said the emperor.\"\\nBut instead  of a book, it was a work of artcontained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made  to look like aliving one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.As  soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like thereal one, and could  move its tail up and down, which sparkled withsilver and gold.\"\\nRound its neck hung  a piece of ribbon, on which waswritten \"The Emperor of China\\'s nightingale is poor  compared with thatof the Emperor of Japan\\'s.\"\\n  \"This is very beautiful,\" exclaimed all who saw it, and he who hadbrought the  artificial bird received the title of \"Imperialnightingale-bringer-in-chief.\"\\n  \"Now they must sing together,\" said the court, \"and what a duet itwill be.\"\\n But they  did not get on well, for the real nightingalesang in its own natural way, but the  artificial bird sang onlywaltzes.\"\\n \"That is not a fault,\" said the music-master, \"it is quite perfectto my taste,\" so  then it had to sing alone, and was as successful asthe real bird; besides, it was  so much prettier to look at, for itsparkled like bracelets and breast-pins.\"\\nThree  and thirty times did itsing the same tunes without being tired; the people would  gladlyhave heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale oughtto sing  something.\"\\nBut where was she?\"\\nNo one had noticed her whenshe flew out at the open  window, back to her own green woods.\"\\n \"What strange conduct,\" said the emperor, when her flight had beendiscovered; and  all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was avery ungrateful creature.\"\\n \"But we have the best bird after all,\" said one, and then theywould have the bird  sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth timethey had listened to the same piece,  and even then they had not learntit, for it was rather difficult.\"\\nBut the music-master  praised the birdin the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than areal  nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds,but also in its musical  power.\"\\n\"For you must perceive, my chief lordand emperor, that with a real nightingale  we can never tell what isgoing to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled.\"\\n It canbe opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzesare formed,  and why one note follows upon another.\"\\n  \"This is exactly what we think,\" they all replied, and then themusic-master received  permission to exhibit the bird to the peopleon the following Sunday, and the emperor  commanded that they should bepresent to hear it sing.\"\\nWhen they heard it they were  like peopleintoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which isquite  a Chinese custom.\"\\nThey all said \"Oh!\"\\n and held up theirforefingers and nodded, but  a poor fisherman, who had heard the realnightingale, said, \"it sounds prettily enough,  and the melodies areall alike; yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly  tellwhat.\"\\n  And after this the real nightingale was banished from theempire, and the artificial  bird placed on a silk cushion close tothe emperor\\'s bed.\"\\nThe presents of gold and  precious stones whichhad been received with it were round the bird, and it was now  advancedto the title of \"Little Imperial Toilet Singer,\" and to the rank ofNo.\"\\n1 on  the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, onwhich the heart lies, as  the most noble, and the heart of an emperoris in the same place as that of other people.\"\\n The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about theartificial bird,  which was very learned and very long, and full of themost difficult Chinese words;  yet all the people said they had readit, and understood it, for fear of being thought  stupid and havingtheir bodies trampled upon.\"\\n So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the otherChinese knew every  little turn in the artificial bird\\'s song; andfor that same reason it pleased them  better.\"\\nThey could sing withthe bird, which they often did.\"\\nThe street-boys sang,  \"Zi-zi-zi,cluck, cluck, cluck,\" and the emperor himself could sing it also.\"\\nItwas  really most amusing.\"\\n One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, andthe emperor lay in  bed listening to it, something inside the birdsounded \"whizz.\"\\n Then a spring cracked.\"\\n \"Whir-r-r-r\" went all thewheels, running round, and then the music stopped.\"\\nThe  emperorimmediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician; butwhat could  he do?\"\\nThen they sent for a watchmaker; and, after agreat deal of talking and  examination, the bird was put into somethinglike order; but he said that it must be  used very carefully, as thebarrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in  new oneswithout injuring the music.\"\\nNow there was great sorrow, as the birdcould only  be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerousfor the works inside it.\"\\n Then the music-master made a little speech,full of hard words, and declared that the  bird was as good as ever;and, of course no one contradicted him.\"\\n Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land.\"\\nTheChinese really were  fond of their emperor, and he now lay so illthat he was not expected to live.\"\\nAlready  a new emperor had beenchosen and the people who stood in the street asked  thelord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, \"Pooh!\"\\n andshook his  head.\"\\n Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole courtthought he was dead,  and every one ran away to pay homage to hissuccessor.\"\\nThe chamberlains went out to  have a talk on the matter, andthe ladies\\'-maids invited company to take coffee.\"\\nCloth  had beenlaid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep shouldbe heard,  and all was silent and still.\"\\nBut the emperor was not yetdead, although he lay white  and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with thelong velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels.\"\\n A window stood open,and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird.\"\\n Thepoor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strangeweight on his chest,  opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there.He had put on the emperor\\'s golden crown,  and held in one hand hissword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.\"\\nAll  aroundthe bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number ofstrange  heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking.These were the emperor\\'s  good and bad deeds, which stared him in theface now Death sat at his heart.\"\\n \"Do you remember this?\"\\n \"Do you recollect that?\"\\n they asked oneafter another, thus  bringing to his remembrance circumstances thatmade the perspiration stand on his  brow.\"\\n \"I know nothing about it,\" said the emperor.\"\\n\"Music!\"\\nmusic!\"\\n hecried; \"the large  Chinese drum!\"\\nthat I may not hear what they say.\"\\nBut they still went on, and Death  nodded like a Chinaman to all theysaid.\"\\n\"Music!\"\\nmusic!\"\\n shouted the emperor.\"\\n\"You  little precious goldenbird, sing, pray sing!\"\\nI have given you gold and costly presents;  Ihave even hung my golden slipper round your neck.\"\\nSing!\"\\nsing!\"\\n But thebird remained  silent.\"\\nThere was no one to wind it up, and therefore itcould not sing a note.\"\\n Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, holloweyes, and the room was  fearfully still.\"\\nSuddenly there came throughthe open window the sound of sweet music.\"\\n Outside, on the bough of atree, sat the living nightingale.\"\\nShe had heard of the  emperor\\'sillness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.And as she  sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in theemperor\\'s veins flowed more  rapidly, and gave life to his weaklimbs; and even Death himself listened, and said,  \"Go on, littlenightingale, go on.\"\\n  \"Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that richbanner?\"\\nand will you  give me the emperor\\'s crown?\"\\n said the bird.\"\\n So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and thenightingale continued  her singing.\"\\nShe sung of the quiet churchyard,where the white roses grow, where the  elder-tree wafts its perfumeon the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened  by themourners\\' tears.\"\\nThen Death longed to go and see his garden, andfloated out  through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.\"\\n \"Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird.\"\\nI know you well.\"\\nIbanished you from my  kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away theevil faces from my bed, and banished  Death from my heart, with yoursweet song.\"\\nHow can I reward you?\"\\n  \"You have already rewarded me,\" said the nightingale.\"\\n\"I shallnever forget that I  drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang toyou.\"\\nThese are the jewels that rejoice  a singer\\'s heart.\"\\nBut nowsleep, and grow strong and well again.\"\\nI will sing to you  again.\"\\n  And as she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and how mildand refreshing that  slumber was!\"\\nWhen he awoke, strengthened andrestored, the sun shone brightly through  the window; but not one ofhis servants had returned- they all believed he was dead;  only thenightingale still sat beside him, and sang.\"\\n \"You must always remain with me,\" said the emperor.\"\\n\"You shallsing only when it pleases  you; and I will break the artificial birdinto a thousand pieces.\"\\n  \"No; do not do that,\" replied the nightingale; \"the bird didvery well as long as it  could.\"\\nKeep it here still.\"\\nI cannot live inthe palace, and build my nest; but let  me come when I like.\"\\nI will siton a bough outside your window, in the evening, and  sing to you, sothat you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.\"\\nI will sing toyou  of those who are happy, and those who suffer; of the good andthe evil, who are hidden  around you.\"\\nThe little singing bird flies farfrom you and your court to the home of  the fisherman and the peasant\\'scot.\"\\nI love your heart better than your crown; and  yet somethingholy lingers round that also.\"\\nI will come, I will sing to you; but youmust  promise me one thing.\"\\n  \"Everything,\" said the emperor, who, having dressed himself in hisimperial robes,  stood with the hand that held the heavy golden swordpressed to his heart.\"\\n \"I only ask one thing,\" she replied; \"let no one know that youhave a little bird who  tells you everything.\"\\nIt will be best toconceal it.\"\\n So saying, the nightingale flew  away.\"\\n The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo!there he stood,  and, to their astonishment, said, \"Good morning.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE OLD BACHELOR\\'S NIGHTCAP  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name.\"\\nIt iscalled \"Hysken\" street.\"\\n Where the name came from, and what it means isvery uncertain.\"\\nIt is said to be German,  but that is unjust to theGermans, for it would then be called \"Hauschen,\" not  \"Hysken.\"\\n\"Hauschen,\" means a little house; and for many years it consisted onlyof  a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the woodenbooths we see in the  market-places at fair time.\"\\nThey were perhaps alittle higher, and had windows; but  the panes consisted of horn orbladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to have glazed  windows inevery house.\"\\nThis was a long time ago, so long indeed that ourgrandfathers,  and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those daysas \"olden times;\" indeed, many  centuries have passed since then.\"\\n The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade inCopenhagen, did not  reside in the town themselves, but sent theirclerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths  in the Hauschen street, andsold beer and spices.\"\\nThe German beer was very good, and  there weremany sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities of allsorts  of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper;indeed, pepper was almost  the chief article sold here; so ithappened at last that the German clerks in Denmark  got theirnickname of \"pepper gentry.\"\\n It had been made a condition with theseclerks  that they should not marry; so that those who lived to be oldhad to take care of  themselves, to attend to their own comforts, andeven to light their own fires, when  they had any to light.\"\\nMany ofthem were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange  thoughts andeccentric habits.\"\\nFrom this, all unmarried men, who have attained  acertain age, are called, in Denmark, \"pepper gentry;\" and this must beremembered  by all those who wish to understand the story.\"\\nThese\"pepper gentlemen,\" or, as they  are called in England, \"oldbachelors,\" are often made a butt of ridicule; they are  told to put ontheir nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep.\"\\nTheboys  in Denmark make a song of it, thus:-  \"Poor old bachelor, cut your wood,  Such a nightcap was never seen;  Who would think it was ever clean?\"\\n Go to sleep, it will do you good.\"\\n  So they sing about the \"pepper gentleman;\" so do they make sportof the poor old  bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they reallyknow nothing of either.\"\\nIt is  a cap that no one need wish for, orlaugh at.\"\\nAnd why not?\"\\nWell, we shall hear in the  story.\"\\n In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengerswould stumble out of  one hole into another, as they generally do inunfrequented highways; and the street  was so narrow, and the boothsleaning against each other were so close together, that  in thesummer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one boothto another  opposite.\"\\nAt these times the odor of the pepper, saffron,and ginger became more  powerful than ever.\"\\nBehind the counter, as arule, there were no young men.\"\\nThe clerks  were almost all old boys;but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see old  menrepresented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, and with coatand  waistcoat buttoned up to the chin.\"\\nWe have seen the portraits ofour great-grandfathers  dressed in this way; but the \"pepper gentlemen\"had no money to spare to have their  portraits taken, though one ofthem would have made a very interesting picture for  us now, if takenas he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, oron  holidays.\"\\nOn these occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmedhats, and  sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his.The woollen shirt was concealed  by a broad, linen collar; the closejacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak  hung loosely overit; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for  theclerks wore no stockings.\"\\nThey generally stuck a table-knife and spoonin their  girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection tothemselves; and such a weapon  was often very necessary.\"\\n After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays andfestivals, excepting that,  instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore akind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap,  a regular nightcap, towhich he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he  had two,nightcaps I mean, not heads.\"\\nAnthony was one of the oldest of theclerks, and  just the subject for a painter.\"\\nHe was as thin as alath, wrinkled round the mouth  and eyes, had long, bony fingers,bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung  a thick tuft of hair,which did not look handsome, but made his appearance  veryremarkable.\"\\nPeople knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactlyhis home,  although his master resided there.\"\\nHis ancestors were fromThuringia, and had lived  in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg.Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place,  but he thought of it all themore.\"\\n The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together; eachone remained in his  own booth, which was closed early enough in theevening, and then it looked dark and  dismal out in the street.\"\\nOnlya faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn  panes in thelittle window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generallyon  his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would bemoving about in his  booth till late in the night, busily employed inmany things.\"\\nIt certainly was not  a very lively existence.\"\\nTo be astranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one  notices youunless you happen to stand in their way.\"\\nOften, when it was dark  nightoutside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite desertedand gloomy.\"\\n There were no lamps in the street, excepting a verysmall one, which hung at one end  of the street, before a picture ofthe Virgin, which had been painted on the wall.\"\\n The dashing of thewater against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly  beheard.\"\\nSuch evenings are long and dreary, unless people can findsomething to do;  and so Anthony found it.\"\\nThere were not always thingsto be packed or unpacked, nor  paper bags to be made, nor the scales tobe polished.\"\\nSo Anthony invented employment;  he mended his clothes andpatched his boots, and when he at last went to bed,- his  nightcap,which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head; he hadonly to pull  it down a little farther over his forehead.\"\\nVery soon,however, it would be pushed  up again to see if the light wasproperly put out; he would touch it, press the wick  together, and atlast pull his nightcap over his eyes and lie down again on the  otherside.\"\\nBut often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whetherevery coal  had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shopbelow.\"\\nIf even a tiny spark  had remained it might set fire tosomething, and cause great damage.\"\\nThen he would  rise from his bed,creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight  ofstairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; sohe had just  to go back again to bed.\"\\nBut often, when he had got halfway back, he would fancy the  iron shutters of the door were notproperly fastened, and his thin legs would carry  him down again.\"\\nAndwhen at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his  teethchattered in his head.\"\\nHe would draw the coverlet closer round him,pull his  nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts fromtrade, and from the labors  of the day, to olden times.\"\\nBut this wasscarcely an agreeable entertainment; for  thoughts of olden memoriesraise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the  heartwith painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the wakingeyes.\"\\nAnd  so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, likepearly drops, would fall from  his eyes to the coverlet and roll on thefloor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings  had broken.Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture of lifewhich  had never faded from his heart.\"\\nIf he dried his eyes with hisnightcap, then the tear  and the picture would be crushed; but thesource of the tears remained and welled up  again in his heart.\"\\nThepictures did not follow one another in order, as the  circumstancesthey represented had occurred; very often the most painful wouldcome  together, and when those came which were most full of joy, theyhad always the deepest  shadow thrown upon them.\"\\n The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to bevery beautiful, but  more beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthonywere the beech woods in the neighborhood  of Wartburg.\"\\nMore grand andvenerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud  baronial castle,where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the  rocks;sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all theland of  Denmark.\"\\nHow vividly were represented to him, in aglittering tear that rolled down  his cheek, two children at play- aboy and a girl.\"\\nThe boy had rosy cheeks, golden  ringlets, and clear,blue eyes; he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant; it was  himself.The little girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever andcourageous;  she was the mayor\\'s daughter, Molly.\"\\nThe children wereplaying with an apple; they  shook the apple, and heard the pipsrattling in it.\"\\nThen they cut it in two, and each  of them took half.They also divided the pips and ate all but one, which the littlegirl  proposed should be placed in the ground.\"\\n \"You will see what will come out,\" she said; \"something youdon\\'t expect.\"\\nA whole  apple-tree will come out, but not directly.\"\\nThen they got a flower-pot, filled it  with earth, and were soon bothvery busy and eager about it.\"\\nThe boy made a hole in  the earth withhis finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and thenthey  both covered it over with earth.\"\\n \"Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has takenroot,\" said Molly; \"no  one ever should do that.\"\\nI did so with myflowers, but only twice; I wanted to see  if they were growing.\"\\nIdidn\\'t know any better then, and the flowers all died.\"\\n  Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during thewhole winter he looked  at it, but there was nothing to be seen butblack earth.\"\\nAt last, however, the spring  came, and the sun shone warmagain, and then two little green leaves sprouted forth  in the pot.\"\\n \"They are Molly and me,\" said the boy.\"\\n\"How wonderful they are,and so beautiful!\"\\n  Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.\"\\n \"Who does that stand for?\"\\n thought he, and then came another andanother.\"\\nDay after  day, and week after week, till the plant becamequite a tree.\"\\nAnd all this about the  two children was mirrored toold Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped  away anddisappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of theold man.\"\\n In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stonymountains, one of which  has a rounded outline, and shows itselfabove the rest without tree, bush, or grass  on its barren summits.It is called the \"Venus Mountain,\" and the story goes that the  \"LadyVenus,\" one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there.\"\\nShe is alsocalled \"Lady  Halle,\" as every child round Eisenach well knows.\"\\nSheit was who enticed the noble  knight, Tannhauser, the minstrel, fromthe circle of singers at Wartburg into her  mountain.\"\\n Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one dayMolly said, \"Do  you dare to knock and say, \\'Lady Halle, Lady Halle,open the door: Tannhauser is here!\\'\"  But Anthony did not dare.Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, \"Lady  Halle, LadyHalle,\" loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under  herbreath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; andyet she looked  quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes whenshe was in the garden with a number  of other little girls; theywould all stand round him together, and want to kiss him,  because hedid not like to be kissed, and pushed them away.\"\\nThen Molly was theonly  one who dared to resist him.\"\\n\"I may kiss him,\" she would sayproudly, as she threw  her arms round his neck; she was vain of herpower over Anthony, for he would submit  quietly and think nothing ofit.\"\\nMolly was very charming, but rather bold; and how  she did tease!\"\\n They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was that of atempting fiend.\"\\nSaint  Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the land, thepious princess of Thuringia, whose good  deeds have been immortalizedin so many places through stories and legends, had greater  beautyand more real grace.\"\\nHer picture hung in the chapel, surrounded bysilver lamps;  but it did not in the least resemble Molly.\"\\n The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew yearafter year, till it  became so large that it had to be transplantedinto the garden, where the dew fell  and the sun shone warmly.\"\\nAndthere it increased in strength so much as to be able  to withstandthe cold of winter; and after passing through the severe weather, itseemed  to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy that thecold season had gone.\"\\nIn  autumn it produced two apples, one forMolly and one for Anthony; it could not well  do less.\"\\nThe tree afterthis grew very rapidly, and Molly grew with the tree.\"\\nShe was  as freshas an apple-blossom, but Anthony was not to behold this flower forlong.\"\\nAll  things change; Molly\\'s father left his old home, and Mollywent with him far away.\"\\n In our time, it would be only a journey of afew hours, but then it took more than  a day and a night to travel sofar eastward from Eisenbach to a town still called Weimar,  on theborders of Thuringia.\"\\nAnd Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tearsall flowed  together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.Molly had told him that she  loved him- loved him more than all thesplendors of Weimar.\"\\n One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time hereceived only two letters.\"\\n One came by the carrier, and the other atraveller brought.\"\\nThe way was very long and  difficult, with manyturnings and windings through towns and villages.\"\\nHow often  hadAnthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda, and Anthonyhad thought  the story applied to him, although Tristan means born insorrow, which Anthony  certainly was not; nor was it likely he wouldever say of Molly as Tristan said of  Isolda, \"She has forgotten me.\"\\nBut in truth, Isolda had not forgotten him, her  faithful friend; andwhen both were laid in their graves, one, on each side of thechurch,  the linden-trees that grew by each grave spread over the roof,and, bending towards  each other, mingled their blossoms together.Anthony thought it a very beautiful but  mournful story; yet he neverfeared anything so sad would happen to him and Molly,  as he passed thespot, whistling the air of a song, composed by the minstrel  Walter,called the \"Willow bird,\" beginning-  \"Under the linden-trees,  Out on the heath.\"\\n  One stanza pleased him exceedingly-  \"Through the forest, and in the vale,  Sweetly warbles the nightingale.\"\\n This song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled it ona moonlight night,  when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollowway, on his road to Weimar, to visit  Molly.\"\\nHe wished to arriveunexpectedly, and so indeed he did.\"\\nHe was received with  a heartywelcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company,  whereoverflowing winecups were passed about.\"\\nA pretty room and a good bedwere provided  for him, and yet his reception was not what he hadexpected and dreamed it would be.\"\\n He could not comprehend his ownfeelings nor the feelings of others; but it is easily  understood how aperson can be admitted into a house or a family without becoming oneof  them.\"\\nWe converse in company with those we meet, as we conversewith our  fellow-travellers in a stage-coach, on a journey; we knownothing of them, and perhaps  all the while we are incommoding oneanother, and each is wishing himself or his  neighbor away.\"\\nSomethingof this kind Anthony felt when Molly talked to him of old  times.\"\\n \"I am a straightforward girl,\" she said, \"and I will tell youmyself how it is.\"\\nThere  have been great changes since we were childrentogether; everything is different, both  inwardly and outwardly.\"\\nWecannot control our wills, nor the feelings of our hearts,  by the forceof custom.\"\\nAnthony, I would not, for the world, make an enemy of youwhen  I am far away.\"\\nBelieve me, I entertain for you the kindest wishesin my heart; but  to feel for you what I now know can be felt foranother man, can never be.\"\\nYou must  try and reconcile yourself tothis.\"\\nFarewell, Anthony.\"\\n  Anthony also said, \"Farewell.\"\\n Not a tear came into his eye; hefelt he was no longer  Molly\\'s friend.\"\\nHot iron and cold iron aliketake the skin from our lips, and we feel  the same sensation if we kisseither; and Anthony\\'s kiss was now the kiss of hatred,  as it hadonce been the kiss of love.\"\\nWithin four-and-twenty hours Anthony wasback  again to Eisenach, though the horse that he rode was entirelyruined.\"\\n \"What matters it?\"\\n said he; \"I am ruined also.\"\\nI will destroyeverything that can remind  me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady Venus,the heathen woman.\"\\nI will break down the  apple-tree, and tear it up bythe roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit.\"\\n  The apple-tree was not broken down; for Anthony himself was struckwith a fever, which  caused him to break down, and confined him tohis bed.\"\\nBut something occurred to raise  him up again.\"\\nWhat was it?A medicine was offered to him, which he was obliged to take:  abitter remedy, at which the sick body and the oppressed spirit alikeshuddered.\"\\n Anthony\\'s father lost all his property, and, from beingknown as one of the richest  merchants, he became very poor.\"\\nDark days,heavy trials, with poverty at the door,  came rolling into the houseupon them like the waves of the sea.\"\\nSorrow and suffering  deprivedAnthony\\'s father of his strength, so that he had something else tothink of  besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.He had to take his  father\\'s place, to give orders, to act with energy,to help, and, at last, to go out  into the world and earn his bread.Anthony went to Bremen, and there he learnt what  poverty and hardliving really were.\"\\nThese things often harden the character,  butsometimes soften the heart, even too much.\"\\n How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthonynow, to what he  had thought in his childhood!\"\\nWhat to him were theminstrel\\'s songs?\"\\nAn echo of the  past, sounds long vanished.\"\\nAttimes he would think in this way; yet again and again  the songswould sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious.\"\\n \"God\\'s will is the best,\" he would then say.\"\\n\"It was well that Iwas not allowed to  keep my power over Molly\\'s heart, and that shedid not remain true to me.\"\\nHow I should  have felt it now, when fortunehas deserted me!\"\\nShe left me before she knew of the  change in mycircumstances, or had a thought of what was before me.\"\\nThat is amerciful  providence for me.\"\\nAll has happened for the best.\"\\nShe couldnot help it, and yet I  have been so bitter, and in such enmity againsther.\"\\n  Years passed by: Anthony\\'s father died, and strangers lived in theold house.\"\\nHe had  seen it once again since then.\"\\nHis rich mastersent him journeys on business, and on  one occasion his way led himto his native town of Eisenach.\"\\nThe old Wartburg castle  stoodunchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn out ofthe stone.\"\\nThe  great oaks formed an outline to the scene which he sowell remembered in his childhood.\"\\n The Venus mountain stood out grayand bare, overshadowing the valley beneath.\"\\nHe would  have been glad tocall out \"Lady Halle, Lady Halle, unlock the mountain.\"\\nI would  fainremain here always in my native soil.\"\\n That was a sinful thought,and he offered  a prayer to drive it away.\"\\nThen a little bird in thethicket sang out clearly, and  old Anthony thought of the minstrel\\'ssong.\"\\nHow much came back to his remembrance as  he looked through thetears once more on his native town!\"\\nThe old house was still  standingas in olden times, but the garden had been greatly altered; apathway led  through a portion of the ground, and outside the garden,and beyond the path, stood  the old apple-tree, which he had not brokendown, although he talked of doing so in  his trouble.\"\\nThe sun stillthrew its rays upon the tree, and the refreshing dew fell  upon it asof old; and it was so overloaded with fruit that the branches benttowards  the earth with the weight.\"\\n\"That flourishes still,\" said he,as he gazed.\"\\nOne of the  branches of the tree had, however, beenbroken: mischievous hands must have done this  in passing, for the treenow stood in a public thoroughfare.\"\\n\"The blossoms are  oftenplucked,\" said Anthony; \"the fruit is stolen and the branches brokenwithout a  thankful thought of their profusion and beauty.\"\\nIt mightbe said of a tree, as it has  been said of some men- it was notpredicted at his cradle that he should come to this.\"\\n How brightlybegan the history of this tree, and what is it now?\"\\nForsaken andforgotten,  in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a publicroad.\"\\nThere it stands,  unsheltered, plundered, and broken.\"\\nItcertainly has not yet withered; but in the  course of years thenumber of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last  itwas cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will beover.\"\\n  Such were Anthony\\'s thoughts as he stood under the tree, andduring many a long night  as he lay in his lonely chamber in the woodenhouse in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen,  in the foreign land to which therich merchant of Bremen, his employer, had sent him  on conditionthat he should never marry.\"\\n\"Marry!\"\\nha, ha!\"\\n and he laughed bitterlyto  himself at the thought.\"\\n Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard.\"\\nWithout, asnowstorm made every  one remain at home who could do so.\"\\nThus ithappened that Anthony\\'s neighbors, who  lived opposite to him, didnot notice that his house remained unopened for two days,  and thathe had not showed himself during that time, for who would go out insuch weather  unless he were obliged to do so.\"\\nThey were gray, gloomydays, and in the house whose  windows were not glass, twilight and darknights reigned in turns.\"\\nDuring these two  days old Anthony had notleft his bed, he had not the strength to do so.\"\\nThe bitter  weather hadfor some time affected his limbs.\"\\nThere lay the old bachelor, forsakenby  all, and unable to help himself.\"\\nHe could scarcely reach thewater jug that he had  placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone.It was not fever, nor sickness, but  old age, that had laid him low.\"\\nInthe little corner, where his bed lay, he was  over-shadowed as itwere by perpetual night.\"\\nA little spider, which he could however  notsee, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that thereshould be a kind  of little banner waving over the old man, when hiseyes closed.\"\\nThe time passed slowly  and painfully.\"\\nHe had no tearsto shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came  into hismind.\"\\nHe felt as if the world was now nothing to him, as if he werelying beyond  it, with no one to think of him.\"\\nNow and then he feltslight sensations of hunger and  thirst; but no one came to him, no onetended him.\"\\nHe thought of all those who had  once suffered fromstarvation, of Saint Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth,  thesaint of his home and his childhood, the noble Duchess of Thuringia,that highly  esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringinghope and relief to the sick  inmates.\"\\nThe recollection of her piousdeeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony.\"\\n He thought of her asshe went about speaking words of comfort, binding up the wounds  of theafflicted and feeding the hungry, although often blamed for it byher stern  husband.\"\\nHe remembered a story told of her, that on oneoccasion, when she was carrying  a basket full of wine andprovisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps,  steppedforward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket,whereupon, with  fear and trembling, she answered, \"Roses, which I haveplucked from the garden.\"\\n Then  he tore away the cloth which coveredthe basket, and what could equal the surprise  of the pious woman, tofind that by a miracle, everything in her basket- the wine,  the bread-had all been changed into roses.\"\\n In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mindof Anthony.\"\\nShe was  as a living reality in his little dwelling inthe Danish land.\"\\nHe uncovered his face  that he might look into hergentle eyes, while everything around him changed from its  look ofpoverty and want, to a bright rose tint.\"\\nThe fragrance of roses spreadthrough  the room, mingled with the sweet smell of apples.\"\\nHe saw thebranches of an apple-tree  spreading above him.\"\\nIt was the tree whichhe and Molly had planted together.\"\\nThe  fragrant leaves of the treefell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched  lipsthey seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested onhis breast, a  peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined tosleep.\"\\n\"I shall sleep now,\" he  whispered to himself.\"\\n\"Sleep will do megood.\"\\nIn the morning I shall be upon my feet  again, strong and well.Glorious!\"\\nwonderful!\"\\nThat apple-tree, planted in love, now  appearsbefore me in heavenly beauty.\"\\n And he slept.\"\\n The following day, the third day during which his house had beenclosed, the snow-storm  ceased.\"\\nThen his opposite neighbor stepped overto the house in which old Anthony lived,  for he had not yet showedhimself.\"\\nThere he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with his  oldnightcap tightly clasped in his two hands.\"\\nThe nightcap, however,was not placed  on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white oneon then.\"\\nWhere now were the tears  he had shed?\"\\nWhat had become ofthose wonderful pearls?\"\\nThey were in the nightcap still.\"\\n Such tears asthese cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is forgotten.\"\\nTheold  thoughts and dreams of a bachelor\\'s nightcap still remain.\"\\nNeverwish for such a  nightcap.\"\\nIt would make your forehead hot, causeyour pulse to beat with agitation,  and conjure up dreams which wouldappear realities.\"\\n The first who wore old Anthony\\'s cap felt the truth of this,though it was half a century  afterwards.\"\\nThat man was the mayorhimself, who had already made a comfortable home  for his wife andeleven children, by his industry.\"\\nThe moment he put the cap on  hedreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days.\"\\nHallo!\"\\nhow the  nightcap burns!\"\\n he exclaimed, as he tore it fromhis bead.\"\\nThen a pearl rolled out,  and then another, and another,and they glittered and sounded as they fell.\"\\n\"What can  this be?\"\\nIsit paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?\"\\n They were the tearswhich  old Anthony had shed half a century before.\"\\n To every one who afterwards put this cap on his head, came visionsand dreams which  agitated him not a little.\"\\nHis own history waschanged into that of Anthony till it  became quite a story, and manystories might be made by others, so we will leave them  to relate theirown.\"\\nWe have told the first;

the  vine-leaves still hung upon thebranches of the vines, but they were already tinted  with red and gold;heavy showers fell on the surrounding country, and the cold  autumnwind blew sharp and strong.\"\\nIt was not at all pleasant weather for thepoor.\"\\n The days grew shorter and more gloomy, and, dark as it was outof doors in the open  air, it was still darker within the small,old-fashioned houses of the village.\"\\nThe  gable end of one of thesehouses faced the street, and with its small, narrow windows,  presenteda very mean appearance.\"\\nThe family who dwelt in it were also very poorand  humble, but they treasured the fear of God in their innermosthearts.\"\\nAnd now He was  about to send them a child.\"\\nIt was the hourof the mother\\'s sorrow, when there pealed  forth from the churchtower the sound of festive bells.\"\\nIn that solemn hour the sweet  andjoyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwellingwith thankfulness  and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, alittle son was born to them, the  words of prayer and praise arose fromtheir overflowing hearts, and their happiness  seemed to ring outover town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells\\'chime.\"\\n The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, hadbeen welcomed joyously on  that dark November day.\"\\nIts parents kissedit lovingly, and the father wrote these  words in the Bible, \"On thetenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son.\"\\n And a short  time after,when the child had been baptized, the names he had received wereadded,  \"John Christopher Frederick.\"\\n  And what became of the little lad?- the poor boy of the humbletown of Marbach?\"\\nAh,  indeed, there was no one who thought or supposed,not even the old church bell which  had been the first to sound andchime for him, that he would be the first to sing the  beautiful songof \"The Bell.\"\\n The boy grew apace, and the world advanced with him.\"\\n While he was yet a child, his parents removed from Marbach, andwent to reside in  another town; but their dearest friends remainedbehind at Marbach, and therefore  sometimes the mother and her sonwould start on a fine day to pay a visit to the little  town.\"\\nThe boywas at this time about six years old, and already knew a great manystories  out of the Bible, and several religious psalms.\"\\nWhile seatedin the evening on his  little cane-chair, he had often heard his fatherread from Gellert\\'s fables, and  sometimes from Klopstock\\'s grand poem,\"The Messiah.\"\\n He and his sister, two years  older than himself, hadoften wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered  deathon the cross for us all.\"\\n On his first visit to Marbach, the town appeared to have changedbut very little, and  it was not far enough away to be forgotten.\"\\nThehouse, with its pointed gable, narrow  windows, overhanging walls andstories, projecting one beyond another, looked just  the same as informer times.\"\\nBut in the churchyard there were several new graves;  andthere also, in the grass, close by the wall, stood the old churchbell!\"\\nIt had been  taken down from its high position, in consequence ofa crack in the metal which  prevented it from ever chiming again, and anew bell now occupied its place.\"\\nThe mother  and son were walking inthe churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they  stood stillto look at it.\"\\nThen the mother reminded her little boy of what auseful  bell this had been for many hundred years.\"\\nIt had chimed forweddings and for  christenings; it had tolled for funerals, and to givethe alarm in case of fire.\"\\nWith  every event in the life of man thebell had made its voice heard.\"\\nHis mother also told  him how thechiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy andconfidence,  and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child hadbeen given to her.\"\\nAnd the boy  gazed on the large, old bell with thedeepest interest.\"\\nHe bowed his head over it and  kissed it, old, thrownaway, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass  andnettles.\"\\nThe boy never forgot what his mother told him, and thetones of the old  bell reverberated in his heart till he reachedmanhood.\"\\nIn such sweet remembrance was  the old bell cherished by theboy, who grew up in poverty to be tall and slender, with  a freckledcomplexion and hair almost red; but his eyes were clear and blue asthe deep  sea, and what was his career to be?\"\\nHis career was to begood, and his future life  enviable.\"\\nWe find him taking high honorsat the military school in the division  commanded by the member of afamily high in position, and this was an honor, that is  to say, goodluck.\"\\nHe wore gaiters, stiff collars, and powdered hair, and by thishe  was recognized; and, indeed, he might be known by the word ofcommand- \"March!\"\\nhalt!\"\\n front!\"\\n  The old church bell had long been quite forgotten, and no oneimagined it would ever  again be sent to the melting furnace to make itas it was before.\"\\nNo one could possibly  have foretold this.\"\\nEquallyimpossible would it have been to believe that the tones  of the oldbell still echoed in the heart of the boy from Marbach; or that oneday they  would ring out loud enough and strong enough to be heardall over the world.\"\\nThey had  already been heard in the narrow spacebehind the school-wall, even above the deafening  sounds of \"March!halt!\"\\nfront!\"\\n They had chimed so loudly in the heart of the  youngster,that he had sung them to his companions, and their tones resoundedto the  very borders of the country.\"\\nHe was not a free scholar in themilitary school, neither  was he provided with clothes or food.\"\\nButhe had his number, and his own peg; for  everything here was orderedlike clockwork, which we all know is of the greatest  utility- peopleget on so much better together when their position and duties  areunderstood.\"\\nIt is by pressure that a jewel is stamped.\"\\nThe pressure ofregularity  and discipline here stamped the jewel, which in thefuture the world so well knew.\"\\n In the chief town of the province a great festival was beingcelebrated.\"\\nThe light  streamed forth from thousands of lamps, andthe rockets shot upwards towards the sky,  filling the air with showersof colored fiery sparks.\"\\nA record of this bright display  will livein the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the militaryschool was  in tears and sorrow.\"\\nHe had dared to attempt to reachforeign territories unnoticed,  and must therefore give upfatherland, mother, his dearest friends, all, or sink down  into thestream of common life.\"\\nThe old church bell had still some comfort;it stood  in the shelter of the church wall in Marbach, once soelevated, now quite forgotten.\"\\n The wind roared around it, and couldhave readily related the story of its origin and  of its sweetchimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had broughtfresh  air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunkdown exhausted with fatigue,  with no other worldly possessions thanhope for the future, and a written leaf from  \"Fiesco.\"\\n The windcould have told that his only protector was an artist, who, by  readingeach leaf to him, made it plain; and that they amused themselves byplaying  at nine-pins together.\"\\nThe wind could also describe the palefugitive, who, for weeks  and months, lay in a wretched littleroad-side inn, where the landlord got drunk and  raved, and where themerry-makers had it all their own way.\"\\nAnd he, the pale fugitive,  sangof the ideal.\"\\n For many heavy days and dark nights the heart must suffer toenable it to endure trial  and temptation; yet, amidst it all, wouldthe minstrel sing.\"\\nDark days and cold nights  also passed over theold bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man\\'s  heartfelt it to be a gloomy time.\"\\nWhat would become of this young man,and what would  become of the old bell?\"\\n The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distancethan any one, even  the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; andthe bell in the breast of the young  man was heard in countries wherehis feet had never wandered.\"\\nThe tones went forth  over the wideocean to every part of the round world.\"\\n We will now follow the career of the old bell.\"\\nIt was, as wehave said, carried far  away from Marbach and sold as old copper;then sent to Bavaria to be melted down in  a furnace.\"\\nAnd then whathappened?\"\\n In the royal city of Bavaria, many years after the bell had beenremoved from the tower  and melted down, some metal was required fora monument in honor of one of the most  celebrated characters which aGerman people or a German land could produce.\"\\nAnd now  we see howwonderfully things are ordered.\"\\nStrange things sometimes happen inthis  world.\"\\n In Denmark, in one of those green islands where the foliage of thebeech-woods rustles  in the wind, and where many Huns\\' graves may beseen, was another poor boy born.\"\\nHe  wore wooden shoes, and when hisfather worked in a ship-yard, the boy, wrapped up in  an old worn-outshawl, carried his dinner to him every day.\"\\nThis poor child was nowthe  pride of his country; for the sculptured marble, the work of hishands, had astonished  the world.* To him was offered the honor offorming from the clay, a model of the figure  of him whose name,\"John Christopher Frederick,\" had been written by his father in  theBible.\"\\nThe bust was cast in bronze, and part of the metal used forthis purpose  was the old church bell, whose tones had died away fromthe memory of those at home  and elsewhere.\"\\nThe metal, glowing withheat, flowed into the mould, and formed the  head and bust of thestatue which was unveiled in the square in front of the old  castle.The statue represented in living, breathing reality, the form of himwho was  born in poverty, the boy from Marbach, the pupil of themilitary school, the fugitive  who struggled against poverty andoppression, from the outer world; Germany\\'s great  and immortal poet,who sung of Switzerland\\'s deliverer, William Tell, and of  theheaven-inspired Maid of Orleans.\"\\n * The Danish sculptor Thorwaldsen.\"\\n It was a beautiful sunny day; flags were waving from tower androof in royal Stuttgart,  and the church bells were ringing a joyouspeal.\"\\nOne bell was silent; but it was  illuminated by the brightsunshine which streamed from the head and bust of the  renowned figure,of which it formed a part.\"\\nOn this day, just one hundred years  hadpassed since the day on which the chiming of the old church bell atMarbach had  filled the mother\\'s heart with trust and joy- the day onwhich her child was born in  poverty, and in a humble home; the samewho, in after-years, became rich, became the  noble woman-hearted poet,a blessing to the world- the glorious, the sublime, the  immortal bard,John Christoper Frederick Schiller!\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE OLD GRAVE-STONE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN a house, with a large courtyard, in a provincial town, atthat time of the year  in which people say the evenings are growinglonger, a family circle were gathered  together at their old home.\"\\nAlamp burned on the table, although the weather was mild  and warm,and the long curtains hung down before the open windows, and withoutthe moon  shone brightly in the dark-blue sky.\"\\n But they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old stonethat lay below in  the courtyard not very far from the kitchen door.The maids often laid the clean copper  saucepans and kitchen vessels onthis stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the  children were fondof playing on it.\"\\nIt was, in fact, an old grave-stone.\"\\n \"Yes,\" said the master of the house, \"I believe the stone camefrom the graveyard of  the old church of the convent which was pulleddown, and the pulpit, the monuments,  and the grave-stones sold.\"\\nMyfather bought the latter; most of them were cut in two  and used forpaving-stones, but that one stone was preserved whole, and laid in  thecourtyard.\"\\n  \"Any one can see that it is a grave-stone,\" said the eldest of thechildren; \"the  representation of an hour-glass and part of thefigure of an angel can still be traced,  but the inscription beneath isquite worn out, excepting the name \\'Preben,\\' and a large  \\'S\\' closeby it, and a little farther down the name of \\'Martha\\' can be easilyread.\"\\n But nothing more, and even that cannot be seen unless it hasbeen raining, or when  we have washed the stone.\"\\n  \"Dear me!\"\\nhow singular.\"\\nWhy that must be the grave-stone of PrebenSchwane and his  wife.\"\\n  The old man who said this looked old enough to be thegrandfather of all present in  the room.\"\\n \"Yes,\" he continued, \"these people were among the last who wereburied in the  churchyard of the old convent.\"\\nThey were a very worthyold couple, I can remember them  well in the days of my boyhood.Every one knew them, and they were esteemed by all.\"\\n They were theoldest residents in the town, and people said they possessed a tonof  gold, yet they were always very plainly dressed, in the coarseststuff, but with linen  of the purest whiteness.\"\\nPreben and Marthawere a fine old couple, and when they both  sat on the bench, at thetop of the steep stone steps, in front of their house, with  thebranches of the linden-tree waving above them, and nodded in a gentle,friendly  way to passers by, it really made one feel quite happy.They were very good to the  poor; they fed them and clothed them, andin their benevolence there was judgment as  well as trueChristianity.\"\\nThe old woman died first; that day is still quitevividly  before my eyes.\"\\nI was a little boy, and had accompanied myfather to the old man\\'s  house.\"\\nMartha had fallen into the sleep ofdeath just as we arrived there.\"\\nThe corpse  lay in a bedroom, near tothe one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress  andweeping like a child.\"\\nHe spoke to my father, and to a few neighborswho were there,  of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and howgood and true she, his dead  wife, had been during the number ofyears that they had passed through life together,  and how they hadbecome acquainted, and learnt to love each other.\"\\nI was, as I havesaid,  a boy, and only stood by and listened to what the others said;but it filled me with  a strange emotion to listen to the old man,and to watch how the color rose in his  cheeks as he spoke of thedays of their courtship, of how beautiful she was, and how  many littletricks he had been guilty of, that he might meet her.\"\\nAnd then hetalked  of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed tobe carried back, by his  words, to that joyful time.\"\\nAnd yet thereshe was, lying in the next room, dead- an  old woman, and he was an oldman, speaking of the days of hope, long passed away.\"\\nAh,  well, so itis; then I was but a child, and now I am old, as old as Preben Schwanethen  was.\"\\nTime passes away, and all things changed.\"\\nI can rememberquite well the day on  which she was buried, and how Old Prebenwalked close behind the coffin.\"\\n \"A few years before this time the old couple had had theirgrave-stone prepared, with  an inscription and their names, but not thedate.\"\\nIn the evening the stone was taken  to the churchyard, and laidon the grave.\"\\nA year later it was taken up, that Old Preben  might belaid by the side of his wife.\"\\nThey did not leave behind them wealth,they left  behind them far less than people had believed theypossessed; what there was went to  families distantly related tothem, of whom, till then, no one had ever heard.\"\\nThe  old house, withits balcony of wickerwork, and the bench at the top of the high  steps,under the lime-tree, was considered, by the road-inspectors, too oldand rotten  to be left standing.\"\\nAfterwards, when the same fatebefell the convent church, and  the graveyard was destroyed, thegrave-stone of Preben and Martha, like everything  else, was sold towhoever would buy it.\"\\nAnd so it happened that this stone was not  cutin two as many others had been, but now lies in the courtyard below, ascouring  block for the maids, and a playground for the children.\"\\nThepaved street now passes  over the resting place of Old Preben and hiswife; no one thinks of them any more now.\"\\n  And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his headmournfully, and said,  \"Forgotten!\"\\nAh, yes, everything will beforgotten!\"\\n And then the conversation turned  on other matters.\"\\n But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnesteyes, mounted upon a  chair behind the window curtains, and lookedout into the yard, where the moon was  pouring a flood of light onthe old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared  to him so dulland flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book ofhistory.\"\\n All that the boy had heard of Old Preben and his wifeseemed clearly defined on the  stone, and as he gazed on it, andglanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the  pure air, it was asif the light of God\\'s countenance beamed over His beautiful world.\"\\n \"Forgotten!\"\\nEverything will be forgotten!\"\\n still echoed throughthe room, and in the  same moment an invisible spirit whispered tothe heart of the boy, \"Preserve carefully  the seed that has beenentrusted to thee, that it may grow and thrive.\"\\nGuard it well.\"\\n Throughthee, my child, shall the obliterated inscription on the old,weather-beaten  grave-stone go forth to future generations in clear,golden characters.\"\\nThe old pair  shall again wander through the streetsarm-in-arm, or sit with their fresh, healthy  cheeks on the bench underthe lime-tree, and smile and nod at rich and poor.\"\\nThe seed  of thishour shall ripen in the course of years into a beautiful poem.\"\\nThebeautiful  and the good are never forgotten, they live always instory or in song.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE OLD HOUSE  by Hans Christian Andersen  A VERY old house stood once in a street with several that werequite new and clean.\"\\n The date of its erection had been carved on oneof the beams, and surrounded by scrolls  formed of tulips andhop-tendrils; by this date it could be seen that the old house  wasnearly three hundred years old.\"\\nVerses too were written over thewindows in  old-fashioned letters, and grotesque faces, curiouslycarved, grinned at you from  under the cornices.\"\\nOne story projecteda long way over the other, and under the roof  ran a leaden gutter,with a dragon\\'s head at the end.\"\\nThe rain was intended to pour  outat the dragon\\'s mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for therewas a hole  in the gutter.\"\\nThe other houses in the street were newand well built, with large window  panes and smooth walls.\"\\nAny onecould see they had nothing to do with the old house.\"\\n Perhaps theythought, \"How long will that heap of rubbish remain here to be adisgrace  to the whole street.\"\\nThe parapet projects so far forward thatno one can see out of  our windows what is going on in thatdirection.\"\\nThe stairs are as broad as the staircase  of a castle, andas steep as if they led to a church-tower.\"\\nThe iron railing looks  likethe gate of a cemetery, and there are brass knobs upon it.\"\\nIt isreally too  ridiculous.\"\\n  Opposite to the old house were more nice new houses, which hadjust the same opinion  as their neighbors.\"\\n At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosycheeks, and clear sparkling  eyes, who was very fond of the oldhouse, in sunshine or in moonlight.\"\\nHe would sit  and look at thewall from which the plaster had in some places fallen off, and fancyall  sorts of scenes which had been in former times.\"\\nHow the streetmust have looked when  the houses had all gable roofs, open staircases,and gutters with dragons at the spout.\"\\n He could even see soldierswalking about with halberds.\"\\nCertainly it was a very good  house tolook at for amusement.\"\\n An old man lived in it, who wore knee-breeches, a coat withlarge brass buttons, and  a wig, which any one could see was a realwig.\"\\nEvery morning an old man came to clean  the rooms, and to waitupon him, otherwise the old man in the knee-breeches would have  beenquite alone in the house.\"\\nSometimes he came to one of the windowsand looked out;  then the little boy nodded to him, and the old mannodded back again, till they became  acquainted, and were friends,although they had never spoken to each other; but that  was of noconsequence.\"\\n The little boy one day heard his parents say, \"The old manopposite is very well off,  but is terribly lonely.\"\\n The next Sundaymorning the little boy wrapped something in  a piece of paper andtook it to the door of the old house, and said to the attendant  whowaited upon the old man, \"Will you please give this from me to thegentleman who  lives here; I have two tin soldiers, and this is oneof them, and he shall have it,  because I know he is terribly lonely.\"\\n  And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and thenhe carried the tin  soldier into the house.\"\\n Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he wouldnot like to pay a visit  himself.\"\\nHis parents gave him permission,and so it was that he gained admission to  the old house.\"\\n The brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than ever, asif they had been  polished on account of his visit; and on the doorwere carved trumpeters standing in  tulips, and it seemed as if theywere blowing with all their might, their cheeks were  so puffed out.\"\\nTanta-ra-ra, the little boy is coming; Tanta-ra-ra, the little boy  iscoming.\"\\n  Then the door opened.\"\\nAll round the hall hung old portraits ofknights in armor, and  ladies in silk gowns; and the armor rattled, andthe silk dresses rustled.\"\\nThen came  a staircase which went up a longway, and then came down a little way and led to a  balcony, which wasin a very ruinous state.\"\\nThere were large holes and long cracks,  outof which grew grass and leaves, indeed the whole balcony, thecourtyard, and the  walls were so overgrown with green that they lookedlike a garden.\"\\nIn the balcony stood  flower-pots, on which were headshaving asses\\' ears, but the flowers in them grew just  as they pleased.In one pot pinks were growing all over the sides, at least the  greenleaves were shooting forth stalk and stem, and saying as plainly asthey could  speak, \"The air has fanned me, the sun has kissed me, and Iam promised a little flower  for next Sunday- really for next Sunday.\"\\n  Then they entered a room in which the walls were covered withleather, and the leather  had golden flowers stamped upon it.\"\\n \"Gilding will fade in damp weather,  To endure, there is nothing like leather,\"said the walls.\"\\nChairs handsomely carved,  with elbows on each side,and with very high backs, stood in the room, and as they  creakedthey seemed to say, \"Sit down.\"\\nOh dear, how I am creaking.\"\\nI shallcertainly  have the gout like the old cupboard.\"\\nGout in my back, ugh.\"\\n  And then the little boy entered the room where the old man sat.\"\\n \"Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend,\" said the oldman, \"and thank you  also for coming to see me.\"\\n  \"Thanks, thanks,\" or \"Creak, creak,\" said all the furniture.\"\\n There was so much that the pieces of furniture stood in eachother\\'s way to get a sight  of the little boy.\"\\n On the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture of abeautiful lady, young  and gay, dressed in the fashion of the oldentimes, with powdered hair, and a full,  stiff skirt.\"\\nShe said neither\"thanks\" nor \"creak,\" but she looked down upon the little  boy with hermild eyes; and then he said to the old man,  \"Where did you get that picture?\"\\n  \"From the shop opposite,\" he replied.\"\\n\"Many portraits hang therethat none seem to  trouble themselves about.\"\\nThe persons they representhave been dead and buried long  since.\"\\nBut I knew this lady manyyears ago, and she has been dead nearly half a century.\"\\n  Under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay of witheredflowers, which were no  doubt half a century old too, at least theyappeared so.\"\\n And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the handsturned round; and  as time passed on, everything in the room grewolder, but no one seemed to notice it.\"\\n \"They say at home,\" said the little boy, \"that you are verylonely.\"\\n  \"Oh,\" replied the old man, \"I have pleasant thoughts of all thathas passed, recalled  by memory; and now you are come to visit me,and that is very pleasant.\"\\n  Then he took from the book-case, a book full of picturesrepresenting long processions  of wonderful coaches, such as arenever seen at the present time.\"\\nSoldiers like the  knave of clubs,and citizens with waving banners.\"\\nThe tailors had a flag with a pairof  scissors supported by two lions, and on the shoemakers\\' flagthere were not boots,  but an eagle with two heads, for theshoemakers must have everything arranged so that  they can say, \"Thisis a pair.\"\\n What a picture-book it was; and then the old man went  intoanother room to fetch apples and nuts.\"\\nIt was very pleasant,certainly, to be in  that old house.\"\\n \"I cannot endure it,\" said the tin soldier, who stood on ashelf, \"it is so lonely  and dull here.\"\\nI have been accustomed tolive in a family, and I cannot get used to  this life.\"\\nI cannot bearit.\"\\nThe whole day is long enough, but the evening is longer.\"\\n It is nothere like it was in your house opposite, when your father and mothertalked  so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear childrenmade such a delightful  noise.\"\\nNo, it is all lonely in the old man\\'shouse.\"\\nDo you think he gets any kisses?\"\\n Do you think he ever hasfriendly looks, or a Christmas tree?\"\\nHe will have nothing  now butthe grave.\"\\nOh, I cannot bear it.\"\\n  \"You must not look only on the sorrowful side,\" said the littleboy; \"I think everything  in this house is beautiful, and all the oldpleasant thoughts come back here to pay  visits.\"\\n  \"Ah, but I never see any, and I don\\'t know them,\" said the tinsoldier, \"and I cannot  bear it.\"\\n  \"You must bear it,\" said the little boy.\"\\nThen the old man cameback with a pleasant  face; and brought with him beautiful preservedfruits, as well as apples and nuts;  and the little boy thought no moreof the tin soldier.\"\\nHow happy and delighted the  little boy was; andafter he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a greatdeal  of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then thelittle boy went to  pay another visit.\"\\nThe carved trumpeters blew\"Tanta-ra-ra.\"\\nThere is the little boy.\"\\n Tanta-ra-ra.\"\\n The swords andarmor on the old knight\\'s pictures rattled.\"\\nThe silk  dressesrustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had thegout in  their backs, and cried, \"Creak;\" it was all exactly like thefirst time; for in that  house, one day and one hour were just likeanother.\"\\n\"I cannot bear it any longer,\"  said the tin soldier; \"Ihave wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.\"\\nLet me go  to thewars, and lose an arm or a leg, that would be some change; I cannotbear it.\"\\n Now I know what it is to have visits from one\\'s oldrecollections, and all they bring  with them.\"\\nI have had visits frommine, and you may believe me it is not altogether  pleasant.\"\\nI was verynearly jumping from the shelf.\"\\nI saw you all in your house  opposite,as if you were really present.\"\\nIt was Sunday morning, and you childrenstood  round the table, singing the hymn that you sing every morning.You were standing  quietly, with your hands folded, and your father andmother.\"\\nYou were standing quietly,  with your hands folded, and yourfather and mother were looking just as serious, when  the dooropened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, wasbrought  into the room.\"\\nYou know she always dances when she hears musicand singing of any sort;  so she began to dance immediately, althoughshe ought not to have done so, but she  could not get into the righttime because the tune was so slow; so she stood first  on one leg andthen on the other, and bent her head very low, but it would not suitthe  music.\"\\nYou all stood looking very grave, although it was verydifficult to do so, but  I laughed so to myself that I fell down fromthe table, and got a bruise, which is  there still; I know it was notright to laugh.\"\\nSo all this, and everything else that  I have seen,keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections thatbring  so many thoughts with them.\"\\nTell me whether you still sing onSundays, and tell me  about your little sister Maria, and how my oldcomrade is, the other tin soldier.\"\\nAh,  really he must be very happy; Icannot endure this life.\"\\n  \"You are given away,\" said the little boy; \"you must stay.\"\\nDon\\'tyou see that?\"\\n Then  the old man came in, with a box containing manycurious things to show him.\"\\nRouge-pots,  scent-boxes, and old cards, solarge and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen  like them in thesedays.\"\\nAnd there were smaller boxes to look at, and the piano  wasopened, and inside the lid were painted landscapes.\"\\nBut when the oldman played,  the piano sounded quite out of tune.\"\\nThen he looked at thepicture he had bought at  the broker\\'s, and his eyes sparkledbrightly as he nodded at it, and said, \"Ah, she  could sing that tune.\"\\n  \"I will go to the wars!\"\\nI will go to the wars!\"\\n cried the tinsoldier as loud as he  could, and threw himself down on the floor.Where could he have fallen?\"\\nThe old man  searched, and the little boysearched, but he was gone, and could not be found.\"\\n\"I  shall find himagain,\" said the old man, but he did not find him.\"\\nThe boards of thefloor  were open and full of holes.\"\\nThe tin soldier had fallenthrough a crack between the  boards, and lay there now in an opengrave.\"\\nThe day went by, and the little boy returned  home; the weekpassed, and many more weeks.\"\\nIt was winter, and the windows were  quitefrozen, so the little boy was obliged to breathe on the panes, and ruba hole  to peep through at the old house.\"\\nSnow drifts were lying in allthe scrolls and on  the inscriptions, and the steps were covered withsnow as if no one were at home.\"\\nAnd  indeed nobody was home, for theold man was dead.\"\\nIn the evening, a hearse stopped  at the door, andthe old man in his coffin was placed in it.\"\\nHe was to be taken tothe  country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried himaway; no one followed  him, for all his friends were dead; and thelittle boy kissed his hand to the coffin  as the hearse moved away withit.\"\\nA few days after, there was an auction at the old  house, andfrom his window the little boy saw the people carrying away thepictures  of old knights and ladies, the flower-pots with the longears, the old chairs, and  the cup-boards.\"\\nSome were taken one way,some another.\"\\nHer portrait, which had been  bought at the picturedealer\\'s, went back again to his shop, and there it remained,  for noone seemed to know her, or to care for the old picture.\"\\nIn the spring;they began  to pull the house itself down; people called it completerubbish.\"\\nFrom the street could  be seen the room in which the wallswere covered with leather, ragged and torn, and  the green in thebalcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down  quickly,for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared awayaltogether.\"\\n\"What  a good riddance,\" said the neighbors\\' houses.\"\\nVeryshortly, a fine new house was built  farther back from the road; it hadlofty windows and smooth walls, but in front, on  the spot where theold house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild  vinesgrew up over the neighboring walls; in front of the garden werelarge iron  railings and a great gate, which looked very stately.People used to stop and peep  through the railings.\"\\nThe sparrowsassembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and  chattered all together asloud as they could, but not about the old house; none of  them couldremember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that thelittle  boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parentswere very proud of him.\"\\n He was just married, and had come, with hisyoung wife, to reside in the new house  with the garden in front of it,and now he stood there by her side while she planted  a field flowerthat she thought very pretty.\"\\nShe was planting it herself with herlittle  hands, and pressing down the earth with her fingers.\"\\n\"Ohdear, what was that?\"\\n she  exclaimed, as something pricked her.\"\\nOutof the soft earth something was sticking up.\"\\n It was- only think!- itwas really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost  up inthe old man\\'s room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish fora long  time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have beenfor many years.\"\\nAnd the  young wife wiped the soldier, first with agreen leaf, and then with her fine  pocket-handkerchief, that smeltof such beautiful perfume.\"\\nAnd the tin soldier felt  as if he wasrecovering from a fainting fit.\"\\n\"Let me see him,\" said the youngman, and  then he smiled and shook his head, and said, \"It can scarcelybe the same, but it reminds  me of something that happened to one of mytin soldiers when I was a little boy.\"\\n And  then he told his wife aboutthe old house and the old man, and of the tin soldier which  he hadsent across, because he thought the old man was lonely; and he relatedthe story  so clearly that tears came into the eyes of the young wifefor the old house and the  old man.\"\\n\"It is very likely that this isreally the same soldier,\" said she, and I  will take care of him, andalways remember what you have told me; but some day you  must show methe old man\\'s grave.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know where it is,\" he replied; \"no one knows.\"\\nAll hisfriends are dead; no  one took care of him, and I was only a littleboy.\"\\n  \"Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been,\" said she.\"\\n \"Yes, terribly lonely,\" cried the tin soldier; \"still it isdelightful not to be  forgotten.\"\\n  \"Delightful indeed,\" cried a voice quite near to them; no onebut the tin soldier saw  that it came from a rag of the leather whichhung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding,  and looked like wetearth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-  \"Gilding will fade in damp weather,  To endure, there is nothing like leather.\"\\n  But the tin soldier did not believe any such thing.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE OLD STREET LAMP  by Hans Christian Andersen  DID you ever hear the story of the old street lamp?\"\\nIt is notremarkably interesting,  but for once in a way you may as well listento it.\"\\nIt was a most respectable old lamp,  which had seen many, manyyears of service, and now was to retire with a pension.\"\\nIt  was thisevening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street.\"\\nHisfeelings  were something like those of an old dancer at the theatre,who is dancing for the last  time, and knows that on the morrow shewill be in her garret, alone and forgotten.\"\\n The lamp had very greatanxiety about the next day, for he knew that he had to appear  forthe first time at the town hall, to be inspected by the mayor andthe council, who  were to decide if he were fit for further serviceor not;- whether the lamp was good  enough to be used to light theinhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country,  at some factory;and if not, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry, to bemelted  down.\"\\nIn this latter case it might be turned into anything, andhe wondered very much  whether he would then be able to remember thathe had once been a street lamp, and  it troubled him exceedingly.Whatever might happen, one thing seemed certain, that  he would beseparated from the watchman and his wife, whose family he lookedupon as  his own.\"\\nThe lamp had first been hung up on that veryevening that the watchman, then  a robust young man, had entered uponthe duties of his office.\"\\nAh, well, it was a very  long time sinceone became a lamp and the other a watchman.\"\\nHis wife had a littlepride  in those days; she seldom condescended to glance at the lamp,excepting when she passed  by in the evening, never in the daytime.\"\\nButin later years, when all these,- the  watchman, the wife, and the lamp-had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaned it,  and supplied itwith oil.\"\\nThe old people were thoroughly honest, they had nevercheated  the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it.\"\\n This was the lamp\\'s last night in the street, and to-morrow hemust go to the  town-hall,- two very dark things to think of.\"\\nNo wonderhe did not burn brightly.\"\\nMany  other thoughts also passed throughhis mind.\"\\nHow many persons he had lighted on their  way, and how muchhe had seen; as much, very likely, as the mayor and  corporationthemselves!\"\\nNone of these thoughts were uttered aloud, however; for hewas  a good, honorable old lamp, who would not willingly do harm to anyone, especially  to those in authority.\"\\nAs many things were recalled tohis mind, the light would flash  up with sudden brightness; he had,at such moments, a conviction that he would be  remembered.\"\\n\"Therewas a handsome young man once,\" thought he; \"it is certainly a  longwhile ago, but I remember he had a little note, written on pinkpaper with a gold  edge; the writing was elegant, evidently a lady\\'shand: twice he read it through, and  kissed it, and then looked up atme, with eyes that said quite plainly, \\'I am the  happiest of men!\\'Only he and I know what was written on this his first letter fromhis  lady-love.\"\\nAh, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that Iremember,- it is really  wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thingto another!\"\\nA funeral passed through  the street; a young and beautifulwoman lay on a bier, decked with garlands of flowers,  and attendedby torches, which quite overpowered my light.\"\\nAll along the streetstood  the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join theprocession.\"\\nBut when the  torches had passed from before me, and Icould look round, I saw one person alone,  standing, leaning against mypost, and weeping.\"\\nNever shall I forget the sorrowful  eyes that lookedup at me.\"\\n These and similar reflections occupied the old street  lamp,on this the last time that his light would shine.\"\\nThe sentry, whenhe is relieved  from his post, knows at least who will succeed him, andmay whisper a few words to  him, but the lamp did not know hissuccessor, or he could have given him a few hints  respecting rain,or mist, and could have informed him how far the moon\\'s rays wouldrest  on the pavement, and from which side the wind generally blew, andso on.\"\\n On the bridge over the canal stood three persons, who wished torecommend themselves  to the lamp, for they thought he could give theoffice to whomsoever he chose.\"\\nThe  first was a herring\\'s head, whichcould emit light in the darkness.\"\\nHe remarked that  it would be a greatsaving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post.\"\\nNumber two was  apiece of rotten wood, which also shines in the dark.\"\\nHe consideredhimself descended  from an old stem, once the pride of the forest.The third was a glow-worm, and how  he found his way there the lampcould not imagine, yet there he was, and could really  give light aswell as the others.\"\\nBut the rotten wood and the herring\\'s headdeclared  most solemnly, by all they held sacred, that the glow-wormonly gave light at certain  times, and must not be allowed to competewith themselves.\"\\nThe old lamp assured them  that not one of themcould give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp;  butthey would believe nothing he said.\"\\nAnd when they discovered that hehad not the  power of naming his successor, they said they were veryglad to hear it, for the lamp  was too old and worn-out to make aproper choice.\"\\n At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of thestreet, and through the  air-holes of the old lamp.\"\\n\"What is this Ihear?\"\\n said he; \"that you are going away  to-morrow?\"\\nIs this eveningthe last time we shall meet?\"\\nThen I must present you with  a farewellgift.\"\\nI will blow into your brain, so that in future you shall notonly be  able to remember all that you have seen or heard in thepast, but your light within  shall be so bright, that you shall be ableto understand all that is said or done in  your presence.\"\\n  \"Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,\" said the old lamp;\"I thank you most  heartily.\"\\nI only hope I shall not be melted down.\"\\n  \"That is not likely to happen yet,\" said the wind; \"and I willalso blow a memory into  you, so that should you receive othersimilar presents your old age will pass very  pleasantly.\"\\n  \"That is if I am not melted down,\" said the lamp.\"\\n\"But should I inthat case still  retain my memory?\"\\n  \"Do be reasonable, old lamp,\" said the wind, puffing away.\"\\n At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds.\"\\n\"What willyou give the old lamp?\"\\n  asked the wind.\"\\n \"I can give nothing,\" she replied; \"I am on the wane, and no lampshave ever given  me light while I have frequently shone upon them.\"\\n Andwith these words the moon hid  herself again behind the clouds, thatshe might be saved from further importunities.\"\\n Just then a drop fellupon the lamp, from the roof of the house, but the drop explained  thathe was a gift from those gray clouds, and perhaps the best of allgifts.\"\\n\"I shall  penetrate you so thoroughly,\" he said, \"that youwill have the power of becoming rusty,  and, if you wish it, to crumbleinto dust in one night.\"\\n  But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the windthought so too.\"\\n\"Does  no one give any more?\"\\nWill no one give anymore?\"\\n shouted the breath of the wind, as  loud as it could.\"\\nThen abright falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous streak  behindit.\"\\n \"What was that?\"\\n cried the herring\\'s head.\"\\n\"Did not a star fall?\"\\nIreally believe it  went into the lamp.\"\\nCertainly, when such high-bornpersonages try for the office, we  may as well say \\'Good-night,\\' and gohome.\"\\n  And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a wonderfullystrong light all  around him.\"\\n \"This is a glorious gift,\" said he; \"the bright stars havealways been a joy to me,  and have always shone more brilliantly than Iever could shine, though I have tried  with my whole might; and nowthey have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me  a gift thatwill enable me to see clearly everything that I remember, as if itstill  stood before me, and to be seen by all those who love me.\"\\nAndherein lies the truest  pleasure, for joy which we cannot share withothers is only half enjoyed.\"\\n  \"That sentiment does you honor,\" said the wind; \"but for thispurpose wax lights will  be necessary.\"\\nIf these are not lighted in you,your particular faculties will not  benefit others in the least.\"\\nThestars have not thought of this; they suppose that  you and everyother light must be a wax taper: but I must go down now.\"\\n So he laidhimself  to rest.\"\\n \"Wax tapers, indeed!\"\\n said the lamp, \"I have never yet hadthese, nor is it likely  I ever shall.\"\\nIf I could only be sure of notbeing melted down!\"\\n  The next day.\"\\nWell, perhaps we had better pass over the nextday.\"\\nThe evening had come,  and the lamp was resting in a grandfather\\'schair, and guess where!\"\\nWhy, at the old  watchman\\'s house.\"\\nHe hadbegged, as a favor, that the mayor and corporation would allow  himto keep the street lamp, in consideration of his long and faithfulservice, as he  had himself hung it up and lit it on the day he firstcommenced his duties,  four-and-twenty years ago.\"\\nHe looked upon italmost as his own child; he had no children,  so the lamp was givento him.\"\\nThere it lay in the great arm-chair near to the warm  stove.\"\\nItseemed almost as if it had grown larger, for it appeared quite to fillthe  chair.\"\\nThe old people sat at their supper, casting friendlyglances at the old lamp,  whom they would willingly have admitted toa place at the table.\"\\nIt is quite true that  they dwelt in a cellar,two yards deep in the earth, and they had to cross a stone  passageto get to their room, but within it was warm and comfortable andstrips of list  had been nailed round the door.\"\\nThe bed and thelittle window had curtains, and  everything looked clean and neat.\"\\nOnthe window seat stood two curious flower-pots  which a sailor, namedChristian, had brought over from the East or West Indies.\"\\nThey  were ofclay, and in the form of two elephants, with open backs; they werehollow and  filled with earth, and through the open space flowersbloomed.\"\\nIn one grew some very  fine chives or leeks; this was thekitchen garden.\"\\nThe other elephant, which contained  a beautifulgeranium, they called their flower garden.\"\\nOn the wall hung a largecolored  print, representing the congress of Vienna, and all thekings and emperors at once.\"\\n A clock, with heavy weights, hung on thewall and went \"tick, tick,\" steadily enough;  yet it was alwaysrather too fast, which, however, the old people said was better  thanbeing too slow.\"\\nThey were now eating their supper, while the oldstreet lamp, as  we have heard, lay in the grandfather\\'s arm-chair nearthe stove.\"\\nIt seemed to the  lamp as if the whole world had turnedround; but after a while the old watchman looked  at the lamp, andspoke of what they had both gone through together,- in rain and infog;  during the short bright nights of summer, or in the long winternights, through the  drifting snow-storms, when he longed to be at homein the cellar.\"\\nThen the lamp felt  it was all right again.\"\\nHe saweverything that had happened quite clearly, as if it  were passingbefore him.\"\\nSurely the wind had given him an excellent gift.\"\\nThe oldpeople  were very active and industrious, they were never idle for evena single hour.\"\\nOn Sunday  afternoons they would bring out some books,generally a book of travels which they  were very fond of.\"\\nThe oldman would read aloud about Africa, with its great forests  and the wildelephants, while his wife would listen attentively, stealing aglance now  and then at the clay elephants, which served asflower-pots.\"\\n \"I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,\" she said; and thenhow the lamp wished for  a wax taper to be lighted in him, for then theold woman would have seen the smallest  detail as clearly as he didhimself.\"\\nThe lofty trees, with their thickly entwined  branches, thenaked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of elephants treading  downbamboo thickets with their broad, heavy feet.\"\\n \"What is the use of all my capabilities,\" sighed the old lamp,\"when I cannot obtain  any wax lights; they have only oil and tallowhere, and these will not do.\"\\n One day  a great heap of wax-candleends found their way into the cellar.\"\\nThe larger pieces  were burnt,and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread.\"\\nSothere  were now candles enough, but it never occurred to any one to puta little piece in  the lamp.\"\\n \"Here I am now with my rare powers,\" thought the lamp, \"I havefaculties within me,  but I cannot share them; they do not know thatI could cover these white walls with  beautiful tapestry, or changethem into noble forests, or, indeed, to anything else  they mightwish for.\"\\n The lamp, however, was always kept clean and shining in acorner  where it attracted all eyes.\"\\nStrangers looked upon it aslumber, but the old people  did not care for that; they loved the lamp.One day- it was the watchman\\'s birthday\\ufffethe old woman approachedthe lamp, smiling to herself, and said, \"I will have an  illuminationto-day in honor of my old man.\"\\n And the lamp rattled in his metalframe,  for he thought, \"Now at last I shall have a light within me,\"but after all no wax  light was placed in the lamp, but oil as usual.The lamp burned through the whole  evening, and began to perceive tooclearly that the gift of the stars would remain  a hidden treasureall his life.\"\\nThen he had a dream; for, to one with his  faculties,dreaming was no difficulty.\"\\nIt appeared to him that the old peoplewere dead,  and that he had been taken to the iron foundry to be melteddown.\"\\nIt caused him quite  as much anxiety as on the day when he hadbeen called upon to appear before the mayor  and the council at thetown-hall.\"\\nBut though he had been endowed with the power of  fallinginto decay from rust when he pleased, he did not make use of it.\"\\nHewas therefore  put into the melting-furnace and changed into as elegantan iron candlestick as you  could wish to see, one intended to hold awax taper.\"\\nThe candlestick was in the form  of an angel holding anosegay, in the centre of which the wax taper was to be placed.\"\\n It wasto stand on a green writing table, in a very pleasant room; many bookswere  scattered about, and splendid paintings hung on the walls.\"\\nTheowner of the room was  a poet, and a man of intellect; everything hethought or wrote was pictured around  him.\"\\nNature showed herself to himsometimes in the dark forests, at others in cheerful  meadows where thestorks were strutting about, or on the deck of a ship sailing  acrossthe foaming sea with the clear, blue sky above, or at night theglittering stars.\"\\n \"What powers I possess!\"\\n said the lamp, awaking fromhis dream; \"I could almost wish  to be melted down; but no, that mustnot be while the old people live.\"\\nThey love me  for myself alone,they keep me bright, and supply me with oil.\"\\nI am as well off as  thepicture of the congress, in which they take so much pleasure.\"\\n Andfrom that time  he felt at rest in himself, and not more so than suchan honorable old lamp really  deserved to be.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PEA BLOSSOM  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE were once five peas in one shell, they were green, the shellwas green, and so  they believed that the whole world must be greenalso, which was a very natural  conclusion.\"\\nThe shell grew, and thepeas grew, they accommodated themselves to their  position, and sat allin a row.\"\\nThe sun shone without and warmed the shell, and the  rainmade it clear and transparent; it was mild and agreeable in broaddaylight, and  dark at night, as it generally is; and the peas asthey sat there grew bigger and bigger,  and more thoughtful as theymused, for they felt there must be something else for them  to do.\"\\n \"Are we to sit here forever?\"\\n asked one; \"shall we not become hardby sitting so long?\"\\n It seems to me there must be something outside,and I feel sure of it.\"\\n  And as weeks passed by, the peas became yellow, and the shellbecame yellow.\"\\n \"All the world is turning yellow, I suppose,\" said they,- andperhaps they were right.\"\\n Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell; it was torn off, andheld in human hands, then  slipped into the pocket of a jacket incompany with other full pods.\"\\n \"Now we shall soon be opened,\" said one,- just what they allwanted.\"\\n \"I should like to know which of us will travel furthest,\" said thesmallest of the  five; \"we shall soon see now.\"\\n  \"What is to happen will happen,\" said the largest pea.\"\\n \"Crack\" went the shell as it burst, and the five peas rolled outinto the bright  sunshine.\"\\nThere they lay in a child\\'s hand.\"\\nA littleboy was holding them tightly,  and said they were fine peas for hispea-shooter.\"\\nAnd immediately he put one in and  shot it out.\"\\n \"Now I am flying out into the wide world,\" said he; \"catch me ifyou can;\" and he was  gone in a moment.\"\\n \"I,\" said the second, \"intend to fly straight to the sun, thatis a shell that lets  itself be seen, and it will suit me exactly;\" andaway he went.\"\\n \"We will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves,\" said the twonext, \"we shall still  be rolling onwards;\" and they did certainly fallon the floor, and roll about before  they got into the pea-shooter; butthey were put in for all that.\"\\n\"We shall go farther  than theothers,\" said they.\"\\n \"What is to happen will happen,\" exclaimed the last, as he wasshot out of the  pea-shooter; and as he spoke he flew up against an oldboard under a garret-window,  and fell into a little crevice, which wasalmost filled up with moss and soft earth.\"\\n The moss closed itselfround him, and there he lay, a captive indeed, but not unnoticed  byGod.\"\\n \"What is to happen will happen,\" said he to himself.\"\\n Within the little garret lived a poor woman, who went out to cleanstoves, chop wood  into small pieces and perform such-like hard work,for she was strong and industrious.\"\\n Yet she remained always poor,and at home in the garret lay her only daughter, not  quite grown up,and very delicate and weak.\"\\nFor a whole year she had kept her bed,  andit seemed as if she could neither live nor die.\"\\n \"She is going to her little sister,\" said the woman; \"I had butthe two children, and  it was not an easy thing to support both ofthem; but the good God helped me in my  work, and took one of them toHimself and provided for her.\"\\nNow I would gladly keep  the other thatwas left to me, but I suppose they are not to be separated, and mysick  girl will very soon go to her sister above.\"\\n But the sick girlstill remained where  she was, quietly and patiently she lay all theday long, while her mother was away  from home at her work.\"\\n Spring came, and one morning early the sun shone brightlythrough the little window,  and threw its rays over the floor of theroom.\"\\njust as the mother was going to her  work, the sick girl fixedher gaze on the lowest pane of the window- \"Mother,\" she  exclaimed,\"what can that little green thing be that peeps in at the window?\"\\nItis moving  in the wind.\"\\n  The mother stepped to the window and half opened it.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n shesaid, there is actually  a little pea which has taken root and isputting out its green leaves.\"\\nHow could it  have got into this crack?Well now, here is a little garden for you to amuse yourself  with.\"\\nSo the bed of the sick girl was drawn nearer to the window, that shemight see  the budding plant; and the mother went out to her work.\"\\n \"Mother, I believe I shall get well,\" said the sick child in theevening, \"the sun  has shone in here so brightly and warmly to-day, andthe little pea is thriving so  well: I shall get on better, too, and goout into the warm sunshine again.\"\\n  \"God grant it!\"\\n said the mother, but she did not believe itwould be so.\"\\nBut she propped  up with the little stick the greenplant which had given her child such pleasant hopes  of life, so thatit might not be broken by the winds; she tied the piece of string  tothe window-sill and to the upper part of the frame, so that thepea-tendrils might  twine round it when it shot up.\"\\nAnd it did shootup, indeed it might almost be seen  to grow from day to day.\"\\n \"Now really here is a flower coming,\" said the old woman onemorning, and now at last  she began to encourage the hope that her sickdaughter might really recover.\"\\nShe  remembered that for some time thechild had spoken more cheerfully, and during the  last few days hadraised herself in bed in the morning to look with sparkling eyes  ather little garden which contained only a single pea-plant.\"\\nA weekafter, the invalid  sat up for the first time a whole hour, feelingquite happy by the open window in the  warm sunshine, while outsidegrew the little plant, and on it a pink pea-blossom in  full bloom.\"\\nThelittle maiden bent down and gently kissed the delicate leaves.\"\\nThisday  was to her like a festival.\"\\n \"Our heavenly Father Himself has planted that pea, and made itgrow and flourish, to  bring joy to you and hope to me, my blessedchild,\" said the happy mother, and she  smiled at the flower, as ifit had been an angel from God.\"\\n But what became of the other peas?\"\\nWhy the one who flew out intothe wide world, and  said, \"Catch me if you can,\" fell into a gutteron the roof of a house, and ended his  travels in the crop of apigeon.\"\\nThe two lazy ones were carried quite as far, for they  alsowere eaten by pigeons, so they were at least of some use; but thefourth, who wanted  to reach the sun, fell into a sink and lay therein the dirty water for days and weeks,  till he had swelled to a greatsize.\"\\n \"I am getting beautifully fat,\" said the pea, \"I expect I shallburst at last; no pea  could do more that that, I think; I am themost remarkable of all the five which were  in the shell.\"\\n And the sinkconfirmed the opinion.\"\\n But the young maiden stood at the open garret window, withsparkling eyes and the rosy  hue of health on her cheeks, she foldedher thin hands over the pea-blossom, and thanked  God for what He haddone.\"\\n \"I,\" said the sink, \"shall stand up for my pea.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PEN AND THE INKSTAND  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN a poet\\'s room, where his inkstand stood on the table, theremark was once made,  \"It is wonderful what can be brought out of aninkstand.\"\\nWhat will come next?\"\\nIt is  indeed wonderful.\"\\n  \"Yes, certainly,\" said the inkstand to the pen, and to the otherarticles that stood  on the table; \"that\\'s what I always say.\"\\nIt iswonderful and extraordinary what a number  of things come out of me.It\\'s quite incredible, and I really don\\'t know what is coming  nextwhen that man dips his pen into me.\"\\nOne drop out of me is enough forhalf a page  of paper, and what cannot half a page contain?\"\\nFrom me,all the works of a poet are  produced; all those imaginary characterswhom people fancy they have known or met.\"\\n All the deep feeling, thehumor, and the vivid pictures of nature.\"\\nI myself don\\'t  understand howit is, for I am not acquainted with nature, but it is certainly in  me.From me have gone forth to the world those wonderful descriptions oftroops of  charming maidens, and of brave knights on prancing steeds;of the halt and the blind,  and I know not what more, for I assureyou I never think of these things.\"\\n  \"There you are right,\" said the pen, \"for you don\\'t think atall; if you did, you would  see that you can only provide the means.You give the fluid that I may place upon the  paper what dwells inme, and what I wish to bring to light.\"\\nIt is the pen that writes:  noman doubts that; and, indeed, most people understand as much aboutpoetry as an old  inkstand.\"\\n  \"You have had very little experience,\" replied the inkstand.\"\\nYou have hardly been  in service a week, and are already half wornout.\"\\nDo you imagine you are a poet?\"\\nYou  are only a servant, and beforeyou came I had many like you, some of the goose family,  and othersof English manufacture.\"\\nI know a quill pen as well as I know a steelone.\"\\n I have had both sorts in my service, and I shall have many morewhen he comes- the  man who performs the mechanical part- and writesdown what he obtains from me.\"\\nI should  like to know what will be thenext thing he gets out of me.\"\\n  \"Inkpot!\"\\n exclaimed the pen contemptuously.\"\\n Late in the evening the poet came home.\"\\nHe had been to aconcert, and had been quite  enchanted with the admirable performanceof a famous violin player whom he had heard  there.\"\\nThe performer hadproduced from his instrument a richness of tone that sometimes  soundedlike tinkling waterdrops or rolling pearls; sometimes like the  birdstwittering in chorus, and then rising and swelling in sound like thewind through  the fir-trees.\"\\nThe poet felt as if his own heart wereweeping, but in tones of melody  like the sound of a woman\\'s voice.It seemed not only the strings, but every part of  the instrumentfrom which these sounds were produced.\"\\nIt was a wonderfulperformance  and a difficult piece, and yet the bow seemed to glideacross the strings so easily  that it was as if any one could do it whotried.\"\\nEven the violin and the bow appeared  to perform independentlyof their master who guided them; it was as if soul and spirit  had beenbreathed into the instrument, so the audience forgot the performerin the  beautiful sounds he produced.\"\\nNot so the poet; he rememberedhim, and named him, and  wrote down his thoughts on the subject.\"\\n\"Howfoolish it would be for the violin and  the bow to boast of theirperformance, and yet we men often commit that folly.\"\\nThe  poet, theartist, the man of science in his laboratory, the general,- we alldo it;  and yet we are only the instruments which the Almighty uses; toHim alone the honor  is due.\"\\nWe have nothing of ourselves of which weshould be proud.\"\\n Yes, this is what  the poet wrote down.\"\\nHe wrote itin the form of a parable, and called it \"The Master  and theInstruments.\"\\n  \"That is what you have got, madam,\" said the pen to theinkstand, when the two were  alone again.\"\\n\"Did you hear him readaloud what I had written down?\"\\n  \"Yes, what I gave you to write,\" retorted the inkstand.\"\\n\"Thatwas a cut at you because  of your conceit.\"\\nTo think that you couldnot understand that you were being quizzed.\"\\n I gave you a cut fromwithin me.\"\\nSurely I must know my own satire.\"\\n  \"Ink-pitcher!\"\\n cried the pen.\"\\n \"Writing-stick!\"\\n retorted the inkstand.\"\\nAnd each of them feltsatisfied that he had  given a good answer.\"\\nIt is pleasing to beconvinced that you have settled a matter  by your reply; it issomething to make you sleep well, and they both slept well upon  it.But the poet did not sleep.\"\\nThoughts rose up within him like thetones of the violin,  falling like pearls, or rushing like the strongwind through the forest.\"\\nHe understood  his own heart in thesethoughts; they were as a ray from the mind of the Great Master  of allminds.\"\\n \"To Him be all the honor.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PHILOSOPHER\\'S STONE  by Hans Christian Andersen  FAR away towards the east, in India, which seemed in those daysthe world\\'s end, stood  the Tree of the Sun; a noble tree, such as wehave never seen, and perhaps never may  see.\"\\n The summit of this tree spread itself for miles like an entireforest, each of its  smaller branches forming a complete tree.\"\\nPalms,beech-trees, pines, plane-trees, and  various other kinds, which arefound in all parts of the world, were here like small  branches,shooting forth from the great tree; while the larger boughs, withtheir knots  and curves, formed valleys and hills, clothed with velvetygreen and covered with  flowers.\"\\nEverywhere it was like a bloomingmeadow or a lovely garden.\"\\nHere were birds  from all quarters of theworld assembled together; birds from the primeval forests  ofAmerica, from the rose gardens of Damascus, and from the deserts ofAfrica, in which  the elephant and the lion may boast of being the onlyrulers.\"\\nBirds from the Polar  regions came flying here, and of coursethe stork and the swallow were not absent.\"\\n But the birds were notthe only living creatures.\"\\nThere were stags, squirrels,  antelopes, andhundreds of other beautiful and light-footed animals here found ahome.\"\\n The summit of the tree was a wide-spreading garden, and in themidst of it, where the  green boughs formed a kind of hill, stood acastle of crystal, with a view from it  towards every quarter ofheaven.\"\\nEach tower was erected in the form of a lily, and  within thestern was a winding staircase, through which one could ascend to thetop  and step out upon the leaves as upon balconies.\"\\nThe calyx of theflower itself formed  a most beautiful, glittering, circular hall,above which no other roof arose than the  blue firmament and the sunand stars.\"\\n Just as much splendor, but of another kind, appeared below, in thewide halls of the  castle.\"\\nHere, on the walls, were reflectedpictures of the world, which represented  numerous and varied scenes ofeverything that took place daily, so that it was useless  to read thenewspapers, and indeed there were none to be obtained in this spot.All  was to be seen in living pictures by those who wished it, butall would have been too  much for even the wisest man, and this mandwelt here.\"\\nHis name is very difficult;  you would not be able topronounce it, so it may be omitted.\"\\nHe knew everything that  a man onearth can know or imagine.\"\\nEvery invention already in existence or yetto be,  was known to him, and much more; still everything on earthhas a limit.\"\\nThe wise king  Solomon was not half so wise as this man.He could govern the powers of nature and  held sway over potentspirits; even Death itself was obliged to give him every morning  alist of those who were to die during the day.\"\\nAnd King Solomon himselfhad to die  at last, and this fact it was which so often occupied thethoughts of this great man  in the castle on the Tree of the Sun.\"\\nHeknew that he also, however high he might tower  above other men inwisdom, must one day die.\"\\nHe knew that his children would fade  awaylike the leaves of the forest and become dust.\"\\nHe saw the human racewither and  fall like leaves from the tree; he saw new men come to filltheir places, but the leaves  that fell off never sprouted forth again;they crumbled to dust or were absorbed into  other plants.\"\\n \"What happens to man,\" asked the wise man of himself, \"whentouched by the angel of  death?\"\\nWhat can death be?\"\\nThe body decays, andthe soul.\"\\nYes; what is the soul, and  whither does it go?\"\\n  \"To eternal life,\" says the comforting voice of religion.\"\\n \"But what is this change?\"\\nWhere and how shall we exist?\"\\n  \"Above; in heaven,\" answers the pious man; \"it is there we hope togo.\"\\n  \"Above!\"\\n repeated the wise man, fixing his eyes upon the moonand stars above him.\"\\n He saw that to this earthly sphere above andbelow were constantly changing places,  and that the position variedaccording to the spot on which a man found himself.\"\\nHe  knew, also,that even if he ascended to the top of the highest mountain whichrears  its lofty summit on this earth, the air, which to us seems clearand transparent, would  there be dark and cloudy; the sun would havea coppery glow and send forth no rays,  and our earth would lie beneathhim wrapped in an orange-colored mist.\"\\nHow narrow are  the limits whichconfine the bodily sight, and how little can be seen by the eye of  thesoul.\"\\nHow little do the wisest among us know of that which is soimportant to us  all.\"\\n In the most secret chamber of the castle lay the greatest treasureon earth- the Book  of Truth.\"\\nThe wise man had read it through pageafter page.\"\\nEvery man may read in this  book, but only in fragments.\"\\nTomany eyes the characters seem so mixed in confusion  that the wordscannot be distinguished.\"\\nOn certain pages the writing often appears  sopale or so blurred that the page becomes a blank.\"\\nThe wiser a manbecomes, the more  he will read, and those who are wisest read most.\"\\n The wise man knew how to unite the sunlight and the moonlight withthe light of reason  and the hidden powers of nature; and throughthis stronger light, many things in the  pages were made clear tohim.\"\\nBut in the portion of the book entitled \"Life after Death\"  nota single point could he see distinctly.\"\\nThis pained him.\"\\nShould henever be able  here on earth to obtain a light by which everythingwritten in the Book of Truth should  become clear to him?\"\\nLike the wiseKing Solomon, he understood the language of animals,  and couldinterpret their talk into song; but that made him none the wiser.\"\\nHefound  out the nature of plants and metals, and their power in curingdiseases and arresting  death, but none to destroy death itself.\"\\nIn allcreated things within his reach he  sought the light that shouldshine upon the certainty of an eternal life, but he found  it not.The Book of Truth lay open before him, but, its pages were to him asblank paper.\"\\n Christianity placed before him in the Bible a promiseof eternal life, but he wanted  to read it in his book, in whichnothing on the subject appeared to be written.\"\\n He had five children; four sons, educated as the children ofsuch a wise father should  be, and a daughter, fair, gentle, andintelligent, but she was blind; yet this  deprivation appeared asnothing to her; her father and brothers were outward eyes to  her,and a vivid imagination made everything clear to her mental sight.\"\\nThesons had  never gone farther from the castle than the branches of thetrees extended, and the  sister had scarcely ever left home.\"\\nTheywere happy children in that home of their  childhood, the beautiful andfragrant Tree of the Sun.\"\\nLike all children, they loved  to hearstories related to them, and their father told them many thingswhich other  children would not have understood; but these were asclever as most grownup people  are among us.\"\\nHe explained to themwhat they saw in the pictures of life on the castle  walls- thedoings of man, and the progress of events in all the lands of theearth;  and the sons often expressed a wish that they could be present,and take a part in  these great deeds.\"\\nThen their father told them thatin the world there was nothing  but toil and difficulty: that it wasnot quite what it appeared to them, as they looked  upon it in theirbeautiful home.\"\\nHe spoke to them of the true, the beautiful, and  thegood, and told them that these three held together in the world, andby that union  they became crystallized into a precious jewel,clearer than a diamond of the first  water- a jewel, whose splendor hada value even in the sight of God, in whose brightness  all things aredim.\"\\nThis jewel was called the philosopher\\'s stone.\"\\nHe told them that,by  searching, man could attain to a knowledge of the existence of God,and that it was  in the power of every man to discover the certaintythat such a jewel as the  philosopher\\'s stone really existed.\"\\nThisinformation would have been beyond the  perception of other children;but these children understood, and others will learn  to comprehend itsmeaning after a time.\"\\nThey questioned their father about the true,  thebeautiful, and the good, and he explained it to them in many ways.He told them  that God, when He made man out of the dust of theearth, touched His work five times,  leaving five intense feelings,which we call the five senses.\"\\nThrough these, the true,  the beautiful,and the good are seen, understood, and perceived, and through thesethey  are valued, protected, and encouraged.\"\\nFive senses have beengiven mentally and  corporeally, inwardly and outwardly, to body andsoul.\"\\n The children thought deeply on all these things, and meditatedupon them day and night.\"\\n Then the eldest of the brothers dreamt asplendid dream.\"\\nStrange to say, not only the  second brother but alsothe third and fourth brothers all dreamt exactly the same  thing;namely, that each went out into the world to find the philosopher\\'sstone.\"\\nEach  dreamt that he found it, and that, as he rode back onhis swift horse, in the morning  dawn, over the velvety greenmeadows, to his home in the castle of his father, that  the stonegleamed from his forehead like a beaming light; and threw such abright  radiance upon the pages of the Book of Truth that every wordwas illuminated which  spoke of the life beyond the grave.\"\\nBut thesister had no dream of going out into the  wide world; it never enteredher mind.\"\\nHer world was her father\\'s house.\"\\n \"I shall ride forth into the wide world,\" said the eldest brother.\"\\nI must try what  life is like there, as I mix with men.\"\\nI willpractise only the good and true; with  these I will protect thebeautiful.\"\\nMuch shall be changed for the better while I am  there.\"\\n  Now these thoughts were great and daring, as our thoughtsgenerally are at home, before  we have gone out into the world, andencountered its storms and tempests, its thorns  and its thistles.\"\\nInhim, and in all his brothers, the five senses were  highlycultivated, inwardly and outwardly; but each of them had one sensewhich in  keenness and development surpassed the other four.\"\\nIn thecase of the eldest, this  pre-eminent sense was sight, which he hopedwould be of special service.\"\\nHe had eyes  for all times and all people;eyes that could discover in the depths of the earth  hiddentreasures, and look into the hearts of men, as through a pane ofglass; he could  read more than is often seen on the cheek that blushesor grows pale, in the eye that  droops or smiles.\"\\nStags and antelopesaccompanied him to the western boundary of his  home, and there hefound the wild swans.\"\\nThese he followed, and found himself far away  inthe north, far from the land of his father, which extended eastward tothe ends of  the earth.\"\\nHow he opened his eyes with astonishment!\"\\nHowmany things were to be seen  here!\"\\nand so different to the mererepresentation of pictures such as those in his  father\\'s house.\"\\nAtfirst he nearly lost his eyes in astonishment at the rubbish  andmockery brought forward to represent the beautiful; but he kept hiseyes, and soon  found full employment for them.\"\\nHe wished to gothoroughly and honestly to work in  his endeavor to understand thetrue, the beautiful, and the good.\"\\nBut how were they  represented inthe world?\"\\nHe observed that the wreath which rightly belonged to  thebeautiful was often given the hideous; that the good was oftenpassed by unnoticed,  while mediocrity was applauded, when it shouldhave been hissed.\"\\nPeople look at the  dress, not at the wearer; thoughtmore of a name than of doing their duty; and trusted  more toreputation than to real service.\"\\nIt was everywhere the same.\"\\n \"I see I must make a regular attack on these things,\" said he; andhe accordingly did  not spare them.\"\\nBut while looking for the truth,came the evil one, the father of lies,  to intercept him.\"\\nGladlywould the fiend have plucked out the eyes of this Seer, but  that wouldhave been a too straightforward path for him; he works more cunningly.He  allowed the young man to seek for, and discover, the beautifuland the good; but while  he was contemplating them, the evil spiritblew one mote after another into each of  his eyes; and such aproceeding would injure the strongest sight.\"\\nThen he blew upon  themotes, and they became beams, so that the clearness of his sight wasgone, and the  Seer was like a blind man in the world, and had nolonger any faith in it.\"\\nHe had lost  his good opinion of the world,as well as of himself; and when a man gives up the world,  andhimself too, it is all over with him.\"\\n \"All over,\" said the wild swan, who flew across the sea to theeast.\"\\n \"All over,\" twittered the swallows, who were also flyingeastward towards the Tree  of the Sun.\"\\nIt was no good news which theycarried home.\"\\n \"I think the Seer has been badly served,\" said the second brother,\"but the Hearer  may be more successful.\"\\n  This one possessed the sense of hearing to a very high degree:so acute was this sense,  that it was said he could hear the grassgrow.\"\\nHe took a fond leave of all at home,  and rode away, providedwith good abilities and good intentions.\"\\nThe swallows escorted  him,and he followed the swans till he found himself out in the world,and far away  from home.\"\\nBut he soon discovered that one may have toomuch of a good thing.\"\\nHis hearing  was too fine.\"\\nHe not only heardthe grass grow, but could hear every man\\'s heart beat,  whether insorrow or in joy.\"\\nThe whole world was to him like a clockmaker\\'s  greatworkshop, in which all the clocks were going \"tick, tick,\" and all theturret  clocks striking \"ding, dong.\"\\n It was unbearable.\"\\nFor a longtime his ears endured it,  but at last all the noise and tumultbecame too much for one man to bear.\"\\n There were rascally boys of sixty years old- for years do notalone make a man- who  raised a tumult, which might have made theHearer laugh, but for the applause which  followed, echoing throughevery street and house, and was even heard in country roads.\"\\n Falsehoodthrust itself forward and played the hypocrite; the bells on thefool\\'s cap  jingled, and declared they were church-bells, and the noisebecame so bad for the  Hearer that he thrust his fingers into his ears.Still, he could hear false notes and  bad singing, gossip and idlewords, scandal and slander, groaning and moaning, without  andwithin.\"\\n\"Heaven help us!\"\\n He thrust his fingers farther and fartherinto his ears,  till at last the drums burst.\"\\nAnd now he could hearnothing more of the true, the  beautiful, and the good; for his hearingwas to have been the means by which he hoped  to acquire his knowledge.He became silent and suspicious, and at last trusted no one,  noteven himself, and no longer hoping to find and bring home the costlyjewel, he gave  it up, and gave himself up too, which was worse thanall.\"\\n The birds in their flight towards the east, carried the tidings,and the news reached  the castle in the Tree of the Sun.\"\\n \"I will try now,\" said the third brother; \"I have a keen nose.\"\\nNow that was not a  very elegant expression, but it was his way, and wemust take him as he was.\"\\nHe had  a cheerful temper, and was, besides, areal poet; he could make many things appear  poetical, by the way inwhich he spoke of them, and ideas struck him long before they  occurredto the minds of others.\"\\n\"I can smell,\" he would say; and he attributedto the  sense of smelling, which he possessed in a high degree, a greatpower in the region  of the beautiful.\"\\n\"I can smell,\" he would say,\"and many places are fragrant or  beautiful according to the taste ofthe frequenters.\"\\nOne man feels at home in the  atmosphere of thetavern, among the flaring tallow candles, and when the smell  ofspirits mingles with the fumes of bad tobacco.\"\\nAnother prefers sittingamidst the  overpowering scent of jasmine, or perfuming himself withscented olive oil.\"\\nThis man  seeks the fresh sea breeze, while that oneclimbs the lofty mountain-top, to look down  upon the busy life inminiature beneath him.\"\\n  As he spoke in this way, it seemed as if he had already been outin the world, as if  he had already known and associated with man.But this experience was intuitive- it  was the poetry within him, agift from Heaven bestowed on him in his cradle.\"\\nHe bade  farewell tohis parental roof in the Tree of the Sun, and departed on foot, fromthe  pleasant scenes that surrounded his home.\"\\nArrived at its confines,he mounted on the  back of an ostrich, which runs faster than ahorse, and afterwards, when he fell in  with the wild swans, he swunghimself on the strongest of them, for he loved change,  and away heflew over the sea to distant lands, where there were great forests,deep  lakes, lofty mountains, and proud cities.\"\\nWherever he came itseemed as if sunshine  travelled with him across the fields, forevery flower, every bush, exhaled a renewed  fragrance, as if consciousthat a friend and protector was near; one who understood  them, andknew their value.\"\\nThe stunted rose-bush shot forth twigs, unfolded itsleaves,  and bore the most beautiful roses; every one could see it, andeven the black, slimy  wood-snail noticed its beauty.\"\\n\"I will give myseal to the flower,\" said the snail,  \"I have trailed my slime upon it,I can do no more.\"\\n \"Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world,\" saidthe poet.\"\\nAnd he made  a song upon it, and sung it after his ownfashion, but nobody listened.\"\\nThen he gave  a drummer twopence and apeacock\\'s feather, and composed a song for the drum, and the  drummerbeat it through the streets of the town, and when the people heardit they said,  \"That is a capital tune.\"\\n The poet wrote many songsabout the true, the beautiful,  and the good.\"\\nHis songs were listenedto in the tavern, where the tallow candles flared,  in the fresh cloverfield, in the forest, and on the high-seas; and it appeared as  if thisbrother was to be more fortunate than the other two.\"\\n But the evil spirit was angry at this, so he set to work with sootand incense, which  he can mix so artfully as to confuse an angel,and how much more easily a poor poet.\"\\n The evil one knew how tomanage such people.\"\\nHe so completely surrounded the poet  withincense that the man lost his head, forgot his mission and his home,and at last  lost himself and vanished in smoke.\"\\n But when the little birds heard of it, they mourned, and for threedays they sang not  one song.\"\\nThe black wood-snail became blackerstill; not for grief, but for envy.\"\\n\"They  should have offered meincense,\" he said, \"for it was I who gave him the idea of the  mostfamous of his songs- the drum song of \\'The Way of the World;\\' and itwas I who  spat at the rose; I can bring a witness to that fact.\"\\n  But no tidings of all this reached the poet\\'s home in India.\"\\nThebirds had all been  silent for three days, and when the time ofmourning was over, so deep had been their  grief, that they hadforgotten for whom they wept.\"\\nSuch is the way of the world.\"\\n \"Now I must go out into the world, and disappear like the rest,\"said the fourth brother.\"\\n He was as good-tempered as the third, butno poet, though he could be witty.\"\\n The two eldest had filled the castle with joyfulness, and nowthe last brightness was  going away.\"\\nSight and hearing have always beenconsidered two of the chief senses among  men, and those which theywish to keep bright; the other senses are looked upon as  of lessimportance.\"\\n But the younger son had a different opinion; he had cultivated histaste in every way,  and taste is very powerful.\"\\nIt rules over whatgoes into the mouth, as well as over  all which is presented to themind; and, consequently, this brother took upon himself  to tasteeverything stored up in bottles or jars; this he called the rough partof his  work.\"\\nEvery man\\'s mind was to him as a vessel in whichsomething was concocting; every  land a kind of mental kitchen.\"\\nThere are no delicacies here,\" he said; so he wished  to go out intothe world to find something delicate to suit his taste.\"\\n\"Perhapsfortune  may be more favorable to me than it was to my brothers.\"\\nIshall start on my travels,  but what conveyance shall I choose?\"\\nAre airballoons invented yet?\"\\n he asked of his  father, who knew of allinventions that had been made, or would be made.\"\\n Air balloons had not then been invented, nor steam-ships, norrailways.\"\\n \"Good,\" said he; \"then I shall choose an air balloon; my fatherknows how they are  to be made and guided.\"\\nNobody has invented one yet,and the people will believe that  it is an aerial phantom.\"\\nWhen Ihave done with the balloon I shall burn it, and for  this purpose,you must give me a few pieces of another invention, which will comenext;  I mean a few chemical matches.\"\\n  He obtained what he wanted, and flew away.\"\\nThe birds accompaniedhim farther than they  had the other brothers.\"\\nThey were curious toknow how this flight would end.\"\\nMany more  of them came swoopingdown; they thought it must be some new bird, and he soon had  agoodly company of followers.\"\\nThey came in clouds till the air becamedarkened with  birds as it was with the cloud of locusts over theland of Egypt.\"\\n And now he was out in the wide world.\"\\nThe balloon descended overone of the greatest  cities, and the aeronaut took up his station atthe highest point, on the church steeple.\"\\n The balloon rose againinto the air, which it ought not to have done; what became of  it isnot known, neither is it of any consequence, for balloons had not thenbeen  invented.\"\\n There he sat on the church steeple.\"\\nThe birds no longer hoveredover him; they had  got tired of him, and he was tired of them.\"\\nAll thechimneys in the town were smoking.\"\\n \"There are altars erected to my honor,\" said the wind, whowished to say something  agreeable to him as he sat there boldlylooking down upon the people in the street.\"\\n There was one steppingalong, proud of his purse; another, of the key he carried  behindhim, though he had nothing to lock up; another took a pride in hismoth-eaten  coat; and another, in his mortified body.\"\\n\"Vanity, allvanity!\"\\n he exclaimed.\"\\n\"I must  go down there by-and-by, and touchand taste; but I shall sit here a little while longer,  for the windblows pleasantly at my back.\"\\nI shall remain here as long as the windblows,  and enjoy a little rest.\"\\nIt is comfortable to sleep late in themorning when one had  a great deal to do,\" said the sluggard; \"so Ishall stop here as long as the wind blows,  for it pleases me.\"\\n  And there he stayed.\"\\nBut as he was sitting on the weather-cockof the steeple, which  kept turning round and round with him, he wasunder the false impression that the same  wind still blew, and thathe could stay where he was without expense.\"\\n But in India, in the castle on the Tree of the Sun, all wassolitary and still, since  the brothers had gone away one after theother.\"\\n \"Nothing goes well with them,\" said the father; \"they will neverbring the glittering  jewel home, it is not made for me; they are alldead and gone.\"\\n Then he bent down over  the Book of Truth, and gazed onthe page on which he should have read of the life after  death, but forhim there was nothing to be read or learned upon it.\"\\n His blind daughter was his consolation and joy; she clung to himwith sincere affection,  and for the sake of his happiness and peaceshe wished the costly jewel could be found  and brought home.\"\\n With longing tenderness she thought of her brothers.\"\\nWhere werethey?\"\\nWhere did they  live?\"\\nHow she wished she might dream of them; butit was strange that not even in dreams  could she be brought near tothem.\"\\nBut at last one night she dreamt that she heard  the voices ofher brothers calling to her from the distant world, and she couldnot  refrain herself, but went out to them, and yet it seemed in herdream that she still  remained in her father\\'s house.\"\\nShe did not seeher brothers, but she felt as it were  a fire burning in her hand,which, however, did not hurt her, for it was the jewel  she wasbringing to her father.\"\\nWhen she awoke she thought for a moment thatshe still  held the stone, but she only grasped the knob of herdistaff.\"\\n During the long evenings she had spun constantly, and round thedistaff were woven  threads finer than the web of a spider; humaneyes could never have distinguished these  threads when separatedfrom each other.\"\\nBut she had wetted them with her tears, and  the twistwas as strong as a cable.\"\\nShe rose with the impression that herdream must  be a reality, and her resolution was taken.\"\\n It was still night, and her father slept; she pressed a kissupon his hand, and then  took her distaff and fastened the end of thethread to her father\\'s house.\"\\nBut for  this, blind as she was, shewould never have found her way home again; to this thread  she musthold fast, and trust not to others or even to herself.\"\\nFrom the Treeof the  Sun she broke four leaves; which she gave up to the wind andthe weather, that they  might be carried to her brothers as letters anda greeting, in case she did not meet  them in the wide world.\"\\nPoorblind child, what would become of her in those distant  regions?\"\\nButshe had the invisible thread, to which she could hold fast; and  shepossessed a gift which all the others lacked.\"\\nThis was a determinationto throw  herself entirely into whatever she undertook, and it made herfeel as if she had eyes  even at the tips of her fingers, and couldhear down into her very heart.\"\\nQuietly she  went forth into thenoisy, bustling, wonderful world, and wherever she went the skies  grewbright, and she felt the warm sunbeam, and a rainbow above in the blueheavens  seemed to span the dark world.\"\\nShe heard the song of thebirds, and smelt the scent  of the orange groves and apple orchardsso strongly that she seemed to taste it.\"\\nSoft  tones and charming songsreached her ear, as well as harsh sounds and rough words\\ufffethoughts andopinions in strange contradiction to each other.\"\\nInto the deepestrecesses  of her heart penetrated the echoes of human thoughts andfeelings.\"\\nNow she heard the  following words sadly sung,-  \"Life is a shadow that flits away  In a night of darkness and woe.\"\\nBut then would follow brighter thoughts:  \"Life has the rose\\'s sweet perfume  With sunshine, light, and joy.\"\\nAnd if one stanza sounded painfully-  \"Each mortal thinks of himself alone,  Is a truth, alas, too clearly known;\"Then, on the other hand, came the answer-  \"Love, like a mighty flowing stream,  Fills every heart with its radiant gleam.\"\\nShe heard, indeed, such words as these-  \"In the pretty turmoil here below,  All is a vain and paltry show.Then came also words of comfort-  \"Great and good are the actions done  By many whose worth is never known.\"\\nAnd if sometimes the mocking strain reached her-  \"Why not join in the jesting cry  That contemns all gifts from the throne on high?\"\\nIn the blind girl\\'s heart a stronger  voice repeated-  \"To trust in thyself and God is best,  In His holy will forever to rest.\"\\n  But the evil spirit could not see this and remain contented.\"\\nHehas more cleverness  than ten thousand men, and he found means tocompass his end.\"\\nHe betook himself to  the marsh, and collected a fewlittle bubbles of stagnant water.\"\\nThen he uttered over  them the echoesof lying words that they might become strong.\"\\nHe mixed up togethersongs  of praise with lying epitaphs, as many as he could find,boiled them in tears shed  by envy; put upon them rouge, which he hadscraped from faded cheeks, and from these  he produced a maiden, inform and appearance like the blind girl, the angel of  completeness, asmen called her.\"\\nThe evil one\\'s plot was successful.\"\\nThe world knew  notwhich was the true, and indeed how should the world know?\"\\n \"To trust in thyself and God is best,  In his Holy will forever to rest.\"\\nSo sung the blind girl in full faith.\"\\nShe had  entrusted the four greenleaves from the Tree of the Sun to the winds, as letters of  greetingto her brothers, and she had full confidence that the leaves wouldreach them.\"\\n She fully believed that the jewel which outshines allthe glories of the world would  yet be found, and that upon theforehead of humanity it would glitter even in the castle  of herfather.\"\\n\"Even in my father\\'s house,\" she repeated.\"\\n\"Yes, the placein which this  jewel is to be found is earth, and I shall bring morethan the promise of it with me.\"\\n I feel it glow and swell more and morein my closed hand.\"\\nEvery grain of truth which  the keen wind carried upand whirled towards me I caught and treasured.\"\\nI allowed it  to bepenetrated with the fragrance of the beautiful, of which there is somuch in the  world, even for the blind.\"\\nI took the beatings of aheart engaged in a good action,  and added them to my treasure.\"\\nAllthat I can bring is but dust; still, it is a part  of the jewel weseek, and there is plenty, my hand is quite full of it.\"\\n  She soon found herself again at home; carried thither in aflight of thought, never  having loosened her hold of the invisiblethread fastened to her father\\'s house.\"\\nAs  she stretched out her handto her father, the powers of evil dashed with the fury of  ahurricane over the Tree of the Sun; a blast of wind rushed through theopen doors,  and into the sanctuary, where lay the Book of Truth.\"\\n \"It will be blown to dust by the wind,\" said the father, as heseized the open hand  she held towards him.\"\\n \"No,\" she replied, with quiet confidence, \"it is indestructible.\"\\nIfeel its beam  warming my very soul.\"\\n  Then her father observed that a dazzling flame gleamed from thewhite page on which  the shining dust had passed from her hand.\"\\nItwas there to prove the certainty of  eternal life, and on the bookglowed one shining word, and only one, the word BELIEVE.\"\\n And soonthe four brothers were again with the father and daughter.\"\\nWhen thegreen leaf  from home fell on the bosom of each, a longing had seizedthem to return.\"\\nThey had  arrived, accompanied by the birds of passage,the stag, the antelope, and all the  creatures of the forest who wishedto take part in their joy.\"\\n We have often seen, when a sunbeam burst through a crack in thedoor into a dusty room,  how a whirling column of dust seems tocircle round.\"\\nBut this was not poor,  insignificant, common dust, whichthe blind girl had brought; even the rainbow\\'s  colors are dim whencompared with the beauty which shone from the page on which it  hadfallen.\"\\nThe beaming word BELIEVE, from every grain of truth, had thebrightness  of the beautiful and the good, more bright than themighty pillar of flame that led  Moses and the children of Israel tothe land of Canaan, and from the word BELIEVE arose  the bridge ofhope, reaching even to the unmeasurable Love in the realms of  theinfinite.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PHOENIX BIRD  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the Garden of Paradise, beneath the Tree of Knowledge,bloomed a rose bush.\"\\nHere,  in the first rose, a bird was born.\"\\nHisflight was like the flashing of light, his  plumage was beauteous,and his song ravishing.\"\\nBut when Eve plucked the fruit of the  treeof knowledge of good and evil, when she and Adam were driven fromParadise, there  fell from the flaming sword of the cherub a spark intothe nest of the bird, which  blazed up forthwith.\"\\nThe bird perishedin the flames; but from the red egg in the nest  there flutteredaloft a new one- the one solitary Phoenix bird.\"\\nThe fable tells thathe  dwells in Arabia, and that every hundred years, he burns himself todeath in his nest;

but theylived in the same house, and both had a view of the street,  and of thecourtyard.\"\\nIn the courtyard was a grass-plot, on which grew a bloomingacacia  tree (when it was in bloom), and under this tree satoccasionally the finely-dressed  nurse, with the still morefinely-dressed child of the General- little Emily.\"\\nBefore  themdanced about barefoot the little son of the porter, with his greatbrown eyes and  dark hair; and the little girl smiled at him, andstretched out her hands towards him;  and when the General saw thatfrom the window, he would nod his head and cry,  \"Charming!\"\\n TheGeneral\\'s lady (who was so young that she might very well have beenher  husband\\'s daughter from an early marriage) never came to thewindow that looked upon  the courtyard.\"\\nShe had given orders, though,that the boy might play his antics to  amuse her child, but mustnever touch it.\"\\nThe nurse punctually obeyed the gracious  lady\\'sorders.\"\\n The sun shone in upon the people in the grand first floor, andupon the people in the  cellar; the acacia tree was covered withblossoms, and they fell off, and next year  new ones came.\"\\nThe treebloomed, and the porter\\'s little son bloomed too, and looked  like afresh tulip.\"\\n The General\\'s little daughter became delicate and pale, like theleaf of the acacia  blossom.\"\\nShe seldom came down to the tree now,for she took the air in a carriage.\"\\n She drove out with her mamma,and then she would always nod at the porter\\'s George;  yes, she usedeven to kiss her hand to him, till her mamma said she was too old todo  that now.\"\\n One morning George was sent up to carry the General the lettersand newspapers that  had been delivered at the porter\\'s room in themorning.\"\\nAs he was running up stairs,  just as he passed the door ofthe sand-box, he heard a faint piping.\"\\nHe thought it  was some youngchicken that had strayed there, and was raising cries of distress; butit  was the General\\'s little daughter, decked out in lace and finery.\"\\n \"Don\\'t tell papa and mamma,\" she whimpered; \"they would be angry.\"\\n  \"What\\'s the matter, little missie?\"\\n asked George.\"\\n \"It\\'s all on fire!\"\\n she answered.\"\\n\"It\\'s burning with a brightflame!\"\\n George hurried  up stairs to the General\\'s apartments; heopened the door of the nursery.\"\\nThe window  curtain was almost entirelyburnt, and the wooden curtain-pole was one mass of flame.\"\\n Georgesprang upon a chair he brought in haste, and pulled down the burningarticles;  he then alarmed the people.\"\\nBut for him, the house wouldhave been burned down.\"\\n The General and his lady cross-questioned little Emily.\"\\n \"I only took just one lucifer-match,\" she said, \"and it wasburning directly, and the  curtain was burning too.\"\\nI spat at it, toput it out; I spat at it as much as ever  I could, but I could notput it out; so I ran away and hid myself, for papa and mamma  wouldbe angry.\"\\n  \"I spat!\"\\n cried the General\\'s lady; \"what an expression!\"\\nDid youever hear your papa  and mamma talk about spitting?\"\\nYou must have gotthat from down stairs!\"\\n  And George had a penny given him.\"\\nBut this penny did not go to thebaker\\'s shop, but  into the savings-box; and soon there were so manypennies in the savings-box that he  could buy a paint-box and color thedrawings he made, and he had a great number of  drawings.\"\\nThey seemedto shoot out of his pencil and out of his fingers\\' ends.\"\\nHis  firstcolored pictures he presented to Emily.\"\\n \"Charming!\"\\n said the General, and even the General\\'s ladyacknowledged that it was  easy to see what the boy had meant to draw.\"\\nHe has genius.\"\\n Those were the words that  were carried down intothe cellar.\"\\n The General and his gracious lady were grand people.\"\\nThey hadtwo coats of arms on  their carriage, a coat of arms for each ofthem, and the gracious lady had had this  coat of arms embroidered onboth sides of every bit of linen she had, and even on her  nightcap andher dressing-bag.\"\\nOne of the coats of arms, the one that belonged toher,  was a very dear one; it had been bought for hard cash by herfather, for he had not  been born with it, nor had she; she had comeinto the world too early, seven years  before the coat of arms, andmost people remembered this circumstance, but the family  did notremember it.\"\\nA man might well have a bee in his bonnet, when he hadsuch a coat  of arms to carry as that, let alone having to carry two;and the General\\'s wife had  a bee in hers when she drove to the courtball, as stiff and as proud as you please.\"\\n The General was old and gray, but he had a good seat on horseback,and he knew it,  and he rode out every day, with a groom behind himat a proper distance.\"\\nWhen he came  to a party, he looked somehow as ifhe were riding into the room upon his high horse;  and he had orders,too, such a number that no one would have believed it; but that  wasnot his fault.\"\\nAs a young man he had taken part in the great autumnreviews which  were held in those days.\"\\nHe had an anecdote that he toldabout those days, the only  one he knew.\"\\nA subaltern under his ordershad cut off one of the princes, and taken  him prisoner, and the Princehad been obliged to ride through the town with a little  band ofcaptured soldiers, himself a prisoner behind the General.\"\\nThis wasan  ever-memorable event, and was always told over and over again everyyear by the General,  who, moreover, always repeated the remarkablewords he had used when he returned his  sword to the Prince; thosewords were, \"Only my subaltern could have taken your  Highnessprisoner; I could never have done it!\"\\n And the Prince had replied,\"You are  incomparable.\"\\n In a real war the General had never takenpart.\"\\nWhen war came into the  country, he had gone on a diplomaticcareer to foreign courts.\"\\nHe spoke the French  language so fluentlythat he had almost forgotten his own; he could dance well, he  couldride well, and orders grew on his coat in an astounding way.\"\\nThesentries  presented arms to him, one of the most beautiful girlspresented arms to him, and became  the General\\'s lady, and in time theyhad a pretty, charming child, that seemed as if  it had dropped fromheaven, it was so pretty; and the porter\\'s son danced before it  in thecourtyard, as soon as it could understand it, and gave her all hiscolored  pictures, and little Emily looked at them, and was pleased,and tore them to pieces.\"\\n She was pretty and delicate indeed.\"\\n \"My little Roseleaf!\"\\n cried the General\\'s lady, \"thou art bornto wed a prince.\"\\n  The prince was already at the door, but they knew nothing of it;people don\\'t see far  beyond the threshold.\"\\n \"The day before yesterday our boy divided his bread and butterwith her!\"\\n said the  porter\\'s wife.\"\\n\"There was neither cheese normeat upon it, but she liked it as well  as if it had been roast beef.There would have been a fine noise if the General and  his wife hadseen the feast, but they did not see it.\"\\n George had divided his bread and butter with little Emily, andhe would have divided  his heart with her, if it would have pleasedher.\"\\nHe was a good boy, brisk and clever,  and he went to the nightschool in the Academy now, to learn to draw properly.\"\\nLittle  Emily wasgetting on with her education too, for she spoke French with her\"bonne,\"  and had a dancing master.\"\\n \"George will be confirmed at Easter,\" said the porter\\'s wife;for George had got so  far as this.\"\\n \"It would be the best thing, now, to make an apprentice of him,\"said his father.\"\\n\"It  must be to some good calling- and then he wouldbe out of the house.\"\\n  \"He would have to sleep out of the house,\" said George\\'s mother.\"\\nIt is not easy to  find a master who has room for him at night, and weshall have to provide him with  clothes too.\"\\nThe little bit of eatingthat he wants can be managed for him, for he\\'s  quite happy with afew boiled potatoes; and he gets taught for nothing.\"\\nLet the boy  gohis own way.\"\\nYou will say that he will be our joy some day, and theProfessor says  so too.\"\\n  The confirmation suit was ready.\"\\nThe mother had worked it herself;but the tailor who  did repairs had cut them out, and a capitalcutter-out he was.\"\\n \"If he had had a better position, and been able to keep a workshopand journeymen,\"  the porter\\'s wife said, \"he might have been a courttailor.\"\\n  The clothes were ready, and the candidate for confirmation wasready.\"\\nOn his  confirmation day, George received a great pinchbeckwatch from his godfather, the old  iron monger\\'s shopman, the richestof his godfathers.\"\\nThe watch was an old and tried  servant.\"\\nIt alwayswent too fast, but that is better than to be lagging behind.\"\\nThatwas  a costly present.\"\\nAnd from the General\\'s apartment there arrived ahymn-book bound  in morocco, sent by the little lady to whom George hadgiven pictures.\"\\nAt the beginning  of the book his name was written, andher name, as \"his gracious patroness.\"\\n These  words had been written atthe dictation of the General\\'s lady, and the General had  read theinscription, and pronounced it \"Charming!\"\\n  \"That is really a great attention from a family of such position,\"said the porter\\'s  wife; and George was sent up stairs to showhimself in his confirmation clothes, with  the hymn-book in his hand.\"\\n The General\\'s lady was sitting very much wrapped up, and had thebad headache she always  had when time hung heavy upon her hands.\"\\nShelooked at George very pleasantly, and  wished him all prosperity, andthat he might never have her headache.\"\\nThe General was  walking aboutin his dressing-gown.\"\\nHe had a cap with a long tassel on his head,  andRussian boots with red tops on his feet.\"\\nHe walked three times upand down the room,  absorbed in his own thoughts and recollections, andthen stopped and said:  \"So little George is a confirmed Christian now.\"\\nBe a good man, andhonor those in  authority over you.\"\\nSome day, when you are an oldman, you can say that the General  gave you this precept.\"\\n  That was a longer speech than the General was accustomed tomake, and then he went  back to his ruminations, and looked veryaristocratic.\"\\nBut of all that George heard  and saw up there, littleMiss Emily remained most clear in his thoughts.\"\\nHow graceful  shewas, how gentle, and fluttering, and pretty she looked.\"\\nIf she were tobe drawn,  it ought to be on a soap-bubble.\"\\nAbout her dress, abouther yellow curled hair, there  was a fragrance as of a fresh-blownrose; and to think that he had once divided his  bread and butterwith her, and that she had eaten it with enormous appetite, and  noddedto him at every second mouthful!\"\\nDid she remember anything about it?Yes,  certainly, for she had given him the beautiful hymn-book inremembrance of this; and  when the first new moon in the first new yearafter this event came round, he took  a piece of bread, a penny, andhis hymn-book, and went out into the open air, and opened  the bookto see what psalm he should turn up.\"\\nIt was a psalm of praise andthanksgiving.\"\\n Then he opened the book again to see what would turnup for little Emily.\"\\nHe took great  pains not to open the book in theplace where the funeral hymns were, and yet he got  one that referredto the grave and death.\"\\nBut then he thought this was not a thing  inwhich one must believe; for all that he was startled when soonafterwards the pretty  little girl had to lie in bed, and thedoctor\\'s carriage stopped at the gate every  day.\"\\n \"They will not keep her with them,\" said the porter\\'s wife.\"\\n\"Thegood God knows whom  He will summon to Himself.\"\\n  But they kept her after all; and George drew pictures and sentthem to her.\"\\nHe drew  the Czar\\'s palace; the old Kremlin at Moscow,just as it stood, with towers and cupolas;  and these cupolas lookedlike gigantic green and gold cucumbers, at least in  George\\'sdrawing.\"\\nLittle Emily was highly pleased, and consequently, when aweek had  elapsed, George sent her a few more pictures, all withbuildings in them; for, you  see, she could imagine all sorts of thingsinside the windows and doors.\"\\n He drew a Chinese house, with bells hanging from every one ofsixteen stories.\"\\nHe drew  two Grecian temples with slender marblepillars, and with steps all round them.\"\\nHe  drew a Norwegian church.\"\\nItwas easy to see that this church had been built entirely  of wood, hewnout and wonderfully put together; every story looked as if it hadrockers,  like a cradle.\"\\nBut the most beautiful of all was thecastle, drawn on one of the leaves,  and which he called \"Emily\\'sCastle.\"\\n This was the kind of place in which she must  live.\"\\nThat iswhat George had thought, and consequently he had put into thisbuilding  whatever he thought most beautiful in all the others.\"\\nIthad carved wood-work, like  the Norwegian church; marble pillars,like the Grecian temple; bells in every story;  and was crowned withcupolas, green and gilded, like those of the Kremlin of the Czar.\"\\n Itwas a real child\\'s castle, and under every window was written what thehall or the  room inside was intended to be; for instance: \"HereEmily sleeps;\" \"Here Emily dances;\"  \"Here Emily plays at receivingvisitors.\"\\n It was a real pleasure to look at the castle,  and rightwell was the castle looked at accordingly.\"\\n \"Charming!\"\\n said the General.\"\\n But the old Count- for there was an old Count there, who was stillgrander than the  General, and had a castle of his own- said nothing atall; he heard that it had been  designed and drawn by the porter\\'slittle son.\"\\nNot that he was so very little, either,  for he had alreadybeen confirmed.\"\\nThe old Count looked at the pictures, and had hisown  thoughts as he did so.\"\\n One day, when it was very gloomy, gray, wet weather, the brightestof days dawned for  George; for the Professor at the Academy called himinto his room.\"\\n \"Listen to me, my friend,\" said the Professor; \"I want to speak toyou.\"\\nThe Lord has  been good to you in giving you abilities, and He hasalso been good in placing you  among kind people.\"\\nThe old Count atthe corner yonder has been speaking to me about  you.\"\\nI have alsoseen your sketches; but we will not say any more about those, forthere  is a good deal to correct in them.\"\\nBut from this time forwardyou may come twice a-week  to my drawing-class, and then you willsoon learn how to do them better.\"\\nI think there\\'s  more of thearchitect than of the painter in you.\"\\nYou will have time to think thatover;  but go across to the old Count this very day, and thank Godfor having sent you such  a friend.\"\\n  It was a great house- the house of the old Count at the corner.Round the windows  elephants and dromedaries were carved, all fromthe old times; but the old Count loved  the new time best, and whatit brought, whether it came from the first floor, or from  thecellar, or from the attic.\"\\n \"I think,\" said, the porter\\'s wife, \"the grander people are, thefewer airs do they  give themselves.\"\\nHow kind and straightforward theold count is!\"\\nand he talks exactly  like you and me.\"\\nNow, the Generaland his lady can\\'t do that.\"\\nAnd George was fairly  wild with delightyesterday at the good reception he met with at the Count\\'s, and soam  I to-day, after speaking to the great man.\"\\nWasn\\'t it a good thingthat we didn\\'t bind  George apprentice to a handicraftsman?\"\\nfor hehas abilities of his own.\"\\n  \"But they must be helped on by others,\" said the father.\"\\n \"That help he has got now,\" rejoined the mother; \"for the Countspoke out quite clearly  and distinctly.\"\\n  \"But I fancy it began with the General,\" said the father, \"andwe must thank them too.\"\\n  \"Let us do so with all my heart,\" cried the mother, \"though Ifancy we have not much  to thank them for.\"\\nI will thank the good God;and I will thank Him, too, for letting  little Emily get well.\"\\n  Emily was getting on bravely, and George got on bravely too.\"\\nInthe course of the year  he won the little silver prize medal of theAcademy, and afterwards he gained the great  one too.\"\\n \"It would have been better, after all, if he had beenapprenticed to a handicraftsman,\"  said the porter\\'s wife, weeping;\"for then we could have kept him with us.\"\\nWhat is  he to do in Rome?I shall never get a sight of him again, not even if he comes back;  butthat he won\\'t do, the dear boy.\"\\n  \"It is fortune and fame for him,\" said the father.\"\\n \"Yes, thank you, my friend,\" said the mother; \"you are saying whatyou do not mean.\"\\n You are just as sorrowful as I am.\"\\n  And it was all true about the sorrow and the journey.\"\\nButeverybody said it was a great  piece of good fortune for the youngfellow.\"\\nAnd he had to take leave, and of the General  too.\"\\nTheGeneral\\'s lady did not show herself, for she had her bad headache.On this  occasion the General told his only anecdote, about what he hadsaid to the Prince,  and how the Prince had said to him, \"You areincomparable.\"\\n And he held out a languid  hand to George.\"\\n Emily gave George her hand too, and looked almost sorry; andGeorge was the most sorry  of all.\"\\n Time goes by when one has something to do; and it goes by, too,when one has nothing  to do.\"\\nThe time is equally long, but notequally useful.\"\\nIt was useful to George, and  did not seem long at all,except when he happened to be thinking of his home.\"\\nHow might  the goodfolks be getting on, up stairs and down stairs?\"\\nYes, there was writingabout  that, and many things can be put into a letter- brightsunshine and dark, heavy days.\"\\n Both of these were in the letterwhich brought the news that his father was dead, and  that his motherwas alone now.\"\\nShe wrote that Emily had come down to see her, andhad  been to her like an angel of comfort; and concerning herself,she added that she had  been allowed to keep her situation asporteress.\"\\n The General\\'s lady kept a diary, and in this diary was recordedevery ball she attended  and every visit she received.\"\\nThe diary wasillustrated by the insertion of the  visiting cards of the diplomaticcircle and of the most noble families; and the  General\\'s lady wasproud of it.\"\\nThe diary kept growing through a long time, and amid  manysevere headaches, and through a long course of half-nights, that is tosay, of  court balls.\"\\nEmily had now been to a court ball for thefirst time.\"\\nHer mother had  worn a bright red dress, with black lace,in the Spanish style; the daughter had been  attired in white, fair anddelicate; green silk ribbons fluttered like flag-leaves  among heryellow locks, and on her head she wore a wreath of water-lillies.Her eyes  were so blue and clear, her mouth was so delicate and red,she looked like a little  water spirit, as beautiful as such a spiritcan be imagined.\"\\nThe Princes danced with  her, one after another ofcourse; and the General\\'s lady had not a headache for a  weekafterwards.\"\\n But the first ball was not the last, and Emily could not stand it;it was a good thing,  therefore, that summer brought with it rest,and exercise in the open air.\"\\nThe family  had been invited by the oldCount to visit him at him castle.\"\\nThat was a castle with  a gardenwhich was worth seeing.\"\\nPart of this garden was laid out quite inthe style  of the old days, with stiff green hedges; you walked as ifbetween green walls with  peep-holes in them.\"\\nBox trees and yew treesstood there trimmed into the form of stars  and pyramids, and watersprang from fountains in large grottoes lined with shells.\"\\n Allaround stood figures of the most beautiful stone- that could be seenin their  clothes as well as in their faces; every flower-bed had adifferent shape, and  represented a fish, or a coat of arms, or amonogram.\"\\nThat was the French part of the  garden; and from this partthe visitor came into what appeared like the green, fresh  forest,where the trees might grow as they chose, and accordingly they weregreat and  glorious.\"\\nThe grass was green, and beautiful to walk on, andit was regularly cut,  and rolled, and swept, and tended.\"\\nThat wasthe English part of the garden.\"\\n \"Old time and new time,\" said the Count, \"here they run wellinto one another.\"\\nIn two  years the building itself will put on aproper appearance, there will be a complete  metamorphosis in beautyand improvement.\"\\nI shall show you the drawings, and I shall  show youthe architect, for he is to dine here to-day.\"\\n  \"Charming!\"\\n said the General.\"\\n \"\\'Tis like Paradise here,\" said the General\\'s lady, \"and yonderyou have a knight\\'s  castle!\"\\n  \"That\\'s my poultry-house,\" observed the Count.\"\\n\"The pigeons livein the tower, the  turkeys in the first floor, but old Elsie rules inthe ground floor.\"\\nShe has apartments  on all sides of her.\"\\nThesitting hens have their own room, and the hens with chickens  havetheirs; and the ducks have their own particular door leading to thewater.\"\\n  \"Charming!\"\\n repeated the General.\"\\n And all sailed forth to see these wonderful things.\"\\nOld Elsiestood in the room on  the ground floor, and by her side stood ArchitectGeorge.\"\\nHe and Emily now met for  the first time after several years,and they met in the poultry-house.\"\\n Yes, there he stood, and was handsome enough to be looked at.His face was frank and  energetic; he had black shining hair, and asmile about his mouth, which said, \"I have  a brownie that sits in myear, and knows every one of you, inside and out.\"\\n Old Elsie  had pulledoff her wooden shoes, and stood there in her stockings, to do honor tothe  noble guests.\"\\nThe hens clucked, and the cocks crowed, and theducks waddled to and  fro, and said, \"Quack, quack!\"\\n But the fair, palegirl, the friend of his childhood,  the daughter of the General,stood there with a rosy blush on her usually pale cheeks,  and her eyesopened wide, and her mouth seemed to speak without uttering a word,and  the greeting he received from her was the most beautifulgreeting a young man can desire  from a young lady, if they are notrelated, or have not danced many times together,  and she and thearchitect had never danced together.\"\\n The Count shook hands with him, and introduced him.\"\\n \"He is not altogether a stranger, our young friend George.\"\\n  The General\\'s lady bowed to him, and the General\\'s daughter wasvery nearly giving  him her hand; but she did not give it to him.\"\\n \"Our little Master George!\"\\n said the General.\"\\n\"Old friends!Charming!\"\\n  \"You have become quite an Italian,\" said the General\\'s lady,\"and I presume you speak  the language like a native?\"\\n  \"My wife sings the language, but she does not speak it,\"observed the General.\"\\n At dinner, George sat at the right hand of Emily, whom the Generalhad taken down,  while the Count led in the General\\'s lady.\"\\n Mr.\"\\nGeorge talked and told of his travels; and he could talk well,and was the life  and soul of the table, though the old Count couldhave been it too.\"\\nEmily sat silent,  but she listened, and her eyesgleamed, but she said nothing.\"\\n In the verandah, among the flowers, she and George stood together;the rose-bushes  concealed them.\"\\nAnd George was speaking again, forhe took the lead now.\"\\n \"Many thanks for the kind consideration you showed my old mother,\"he said.\"\\n\"I know  that you went down to her on the night when my fatherdied, and you stayed with her  till his eyes were closed.\"\\nMyheartiest thanks!\"\\n  He took Emily\\'s hand and kissed it- he might do so on such anoccasion.\"\\nShe blushed  deeply, but pressed his hand, and looked athim with her dear blue eyes.\"\\n \"Your mother was a dear soul!\"\\n she said.\"\\n\"How fond she was ofher son!\"\\nAnd she let  me read all your letters, so that I almostbelieve I know you.\"\\nHow kind you were to  me when I was little girl!You used to give me pictures.\"\\n  \"Which you tore in two,\" said George.\"\\n \"No, I have still your drawing of the castle.\"\\n  \"I must build the castle in reality now,\" said George; and hebecame quite warm at  his own words.\"\\n The General and the General\\'s lady talked to each other in theirroom about the porter\\'s  son- how he knew how to behave, and to expresshimself with the greatest propriety.\"\\n \"He might be a tutor,\" said the General.\"\\n \"Intellect!\"\\n said the General\\'s lady; but she did not say anythingmore.\"\\n During the beautiful summer-time Mr.\"\\nGeorge several timesvisited the Count at his  castle; and he was missed when he did notcome.\"\\n \"How much the good God has given you that he has not given to uspoor mortals,\" said  Emily to him.\"\\n\"Are you sure you are verygrateful for it?\"\\n  It flattered George that the lovely young girl should look up tohim, and he thought  then that Emily had unusually good abilities.And the General felt more and more  convinced that George was nocellar-child.\"\\n \"His mother was a very good woman,\" he observed.\"\\n\"It is only rightI should do her  that justice now she is in her grave.\"\\n  The summer passed away, and the winter came; again there wastalk about Mr.\"\\nGeorge.\"\\n He was highly respected, and was received inthe first circles.\"\\nThe General had met  him at a court ball.\"\\n And now there was a ball to be given in the General\\'s house forEmily, and could Mr.\"\\n George be invited to it?\"\\n \"He whom the King invites can be invited by the General also,\"said the General, and  drew himself up till he stood quite an inchhigher than before.\"\\n Mr.\"\\nGeorge was invited, and he came; princes and counts came,and they danced, one  better than the other.\"\\nBut Emily could only danceone dance- the first; for she made  a false step- nothing ofconsequence; but her foot hurt her, so that she had to be  careful, andleave off dancing, and look at the others.\"\\nSo she sat and looked on,and  the architect stood by her side.\"\\n \"I suppose you are giving her the whole history of St.\"\\nPeter\\'s,\"said the General,  as he passed by; and smiled, like thepersonification of patronage.\"\\n With the same patronizing smile he received Mr.\"\\nGeorge a fewdays afterwards.\"\\nThe young  man came, no doubt, to return thanks forthe invitation to the ball.\"\\nWhat else could  it be?\"\\nBut indeed therewas something else, something very astonishing and startling.\"\\n He spokewords of sheer lunacy, so that the General could hardly believe hisown ears.\"\\n It was \"the height of rhodomontade,\" an offer, quite aninconceivable offer- Mr.\"\\nGeorge  came to ask the hand of Emily inmarriage!\"\\n \"Man!\"\\n cried the General, and his brain seemed to be boiling.\"\\n\"Idon\\'t understand you  at all.\"\\nWhat is it you say?\"\\nWhat is it youwant?\"\\nI don\\'t know you.\"\\nSir!\"\\nMan!\"\\nWhat  possesses you to break intomy house?\"\\nAnd am I to stand here and listen to you?\"\\n He  steppedbackwards into his bed-room, locked the door behind him, and leftMr.\"\\nGeorge  standing alone.\"\\nGeorge stood still for a few minutes, andthen turned round and left  the room.\"\\nEmily was standing in thecorridor.\"\\n \"My father has answered?\"\\n she said, and her voice trembled.\"\\n George pressed her hand.\"\\n \"He has escaped me,\" he replied; \"but a better time will come.\"\\n  There were tears in Emily\\'s eyes, but in the young man\\'s eyesshone courage and  confidence; and the sun shone through the window,and cast his beams on the pair, and  gave them his blessing.\"\\n The General sat in his room, bursting hot.\"\\nYes, he was stillboiling, until he boiled  over in the exclamation, \"Lunacy!\"\\nporter!madness!\"\\n  Not an hour was over before the General\\'s lady knew it out ofthe General\\'s own mouth.\"\\n She called Emily, and remained alone withher.\"\\n \"You poor child,\" she said; \"to insult you so!\"\\nto insult us so!There are tears in  your eyes, too, but they become you well.\"\\nYoulook beautiful in tears.\"\\nYou look as  I looked on my wedding-day.Weep on, my sweet Emily.\"\\n  \"Yes, that I must,\" said Emily, \"if you and my father do not say\\'yes.\\'\"  \"Child!\"\\n screamed the General\\'s lady; \"you are ill!\"\\nYou aretalking wildly, and I shall  have a most terrible headache!\"\\nOh, whata misfortune is coming upon our house!\"\\nDon\\'t  make your mother die,Emily, or you will have no mother.\"\\n  And the eyes of the General\\'s lady were wet, for she could notbear to think of her  own death.\"\\n In the newspapers there was an announcement.\"\\n\"Mr.\"\\nGeorge hasbeen elected Professor  of the Fifth Class, number Eight.\"\\n  \"It\\'s a pity that his parents are dead and cannot read it,\" saidthe new porter people,  who now lived in the cellar under the General\\'sapartments.\"\\nThey knew that the  Professor had been born and grown upwithin their four walls.\"\\n \"Now he\\'ll get a salary,\" said the man.\"\\n \"Yes, that\\'s not much for a poor child,\" said the woman.\"\\n \"Eighteen dollars a year,\" said the man.\"\\n\"Why, it\\'s a good deal ofmoney.\"\\n  \"No, I mean the honor of it,\" replied the wife.\"\\n\"Do you think hecares for the money?\"\\n Those few dollars he can earn a hundred timesover, and most likely he\\'ll get a rich  wife into the bargain.\"\\nIf wehad children of our own, husband, our child should be  an architect anda professor too.\"\\n  George was spoken well of in the cellar, and he was spoken well ofin the first floor.\"\\n The old Count took upon himself to do that.\"\\n The pictures he had drawn in his childhood gave occasion for it.But how did the  conversation come to turn on these pictures?\"\\nWhy, theyhad been talking of Russia and  of Moscow, and thus mention was made ofthe Kremlin, which little George had once drawn  for Miss Emily.\"\\nHe haddrawn many pictures, but the Count especially remembered one,  \"Emily\\'sCastle,\" where she was to sleep, and to dance, and to play atreceiving guests.\"\\n \"The Professor was a true man,\" said the Count, \"and would be aprivy councillor before  he died, it was not at all unlikely; and hemight build a real castle for the young  lady before that time came:why not?\"\\n  \"That was a strange jest,\" remarked the General\\'s lady, when theCount had gone away.\"\\n The General shook his head thoughtfully, and wentout for a ride, with his groom behind  him at a proper distance, and hesat more stiffly than ever on his high horse.\"\\n It was Emily\\'s birthday.\"\\nFlowers, books, letters, and visitingcards came pouring in.\"\\n The General\\'s lady kissed her on the mouth, andthe General kissed her on the forehead;  they were affectionateparents, and they and Emily had to receive grand visitors, two  ofthe Princes.\"\\nThey talked of balls and theatres, of diplomaticmissions, of the  government of empires and nations; and then theyspoke of talent, native talent; and  so the discourse turned upon theyoung architect.\"\\n \"He is building up an immortality for himself,\" said one, \"andhe will certainly build  his way into one of our first families\".\"\\n \"One of our first families!\"\\n repeated the General and afterwardsthe General\\'s lady;  \"what is meant by one of our first families?\"\\n  \"I know for whom it was intended,\" said the General\\'s lady, \"but Ishall not say it.\"\\n I don\\'t think it.\"\\nHeaven disposes, but I shall beastonished.\"\\n  \"I am astonished also!\"\\n said the General.\"\\n\"I haven\\'t an idea in myhead!\"\\n And he fell  into a reverie, waiting for ideas.\"\\n There is a power, a nameless power, in the possession of favorfrom above, the favor  of Providence, and this favor little George had.But we are forgetting the birthday.\"\\n Emily\\'s room was fragrant with flowers, sent by male and femalefriends; on the table  lay beautiful presents for greeting andremembrance, but none could come from George\\ufffenone could come fromhim; but it was not necessary, for the whole house was full  ofremembrances of him.\"\\nEven out of the ash-bin the blossom of memorypeeped forth,  for Emily had sat whimpering there on the day when thewindow-curtain caught fire,  and George arrived in the character offire engine.\"\\nA glance out of the window, and  the acacia treereminded of the days of childhood.\"\\nFlowers and leaves had fallen,but  there stood the tree covered with hoar frost, looking like asingle huge branch of  coral, and the moon shone clear and largeamong the twigs, unchanged in its changings,  as it was when Georgedivided his bread and butter with little Emily.\"\\n Out of a box the girl took the drawings of the Czar\\'s palace andof her own castle\\uffferemembrances of George.\"\\nThe drawings were lookedat, and many thoughts came.\"\\nShe  remembered the day when, unobserved byher father and mother, she had gone down to  the porter\\'s wife wholay dying.\"\\nOnce again she seemed to sit beside her, holding  thedying woman\\'s hand in hers, hearing the dying woman\\'s last words:\"Blessing  George!\"\\n The mother was thinking of her son, and now Emilygave her own interpretation  to those words.\"\\nYes, George wascertainly with her on her birthday.\"\\n It happened that the next day was another birthday in thathouse, the General\\'s  birthday.\"\\nHe had been born the day after hisdaughter, but before her of course- many  years before her.\"\\nManypresents arrived, and among them came a saddle of  exquisiteworkmanship, a comfortable and costly saddle- one of the Princes hadjust  such another.\"\\nNow, from whom might this saddle come?\"\\nTheGeneral was delighted.\"\\nThere  was a little note with the saddle.\"\\nNow ifthe words on the note had been \"many thanks  for yesterday\\'sreception,\" we might easily have guessed from whom it came.\"\\nBut  thewords were \"From somebody whom the General does not know.\"\\n  \"Whom in the world do I not know?\"\\n exclaimed the General.\"\\n\"Iknow everybody;\" and his  thoughts wandered all through society, for heknew everybody there.\"\\n\"That saddle comes  from my wife!\"\\n he said atlast.\"\\n\"She is teasing me- charming!\"\\n  But she was not teasing him; those times were past.\"\\n Again there was a feast, but it was not in the General\\'s house, itwas a fancy ball  at the Prince\\'s, and masks were allowed too.\"\\n The General went as Rubens, in a Spanish costume, with a littleruff round his neck,  a sword by his side, and a stately manner.\"\\nTheGeneral\\'s lady was Madame Rubens, in  black velvet made high roundthe neck, exceedingly warm, and with a mill-stone round  her neck inthe shape of a great ruff- accurately dressed after a Dutch picture inthe  possession of the General, in which the hands were especiallyadmired.\"\\nThey were just  like the hands of the General\\'s lady.\"\\n Emily was Psyche.\"\\nIn white crape and lace she was like afloating swan.\"\\nShe did not  want wings at all.\"\\nShe only wore them asemblematic of Psyche.\"\\n Brightness, splendor, light and flowers, wealth and taste appearedat the ball; there  was so much to see, that the beautiful hands ofMadame Rubens made no sensation at  all.\"\\n A black domino, with an acacia blossom in his cap, danced withPsyche.\"\\n \"Who is that?\"\\n asked the General\\'s lady.\"\\n \"His Royal Highness,\" replied the General.\"\\n\"I am quite sure of it.I knew him directly  by the pressure of his hand.\"\\n  The General\\'s lady doubted it.\"\\n General Rubens had no doubts about it.\"\\nHe went up to the blackdomino and wrote the  royal letters in the mask\\'s hand.\"\\nThese weredenied, but the mask gave him a hint.\"\\n The words that came with the saddle: \"One whom you do not know,General.\"\\n  \"But I do know you,\" said the General.\"\\n\"It was you who sent me thesaddle.\"\\n  The domino raised his hand, and disappeared among the otherguests.\"\\n \"Who is that black domino with whom you were dancing, Emily?\"\\nasked the General\\'s lady.\"\\n \"I did not ask his name,\" she replied, \"because you knew it.\"\\nIt isthe Professor.\"\\nYour  protege is here, Count!\"\\n she continued, turning tothat nobleman, who stood close by.\"\\n \"A black domino with acaciablossoms in his cap.\"\\n  \"Very likely, my dear lady,\" replied the Count.\"\\n\"But one of thePrinces wears just  the same costume.\"\\n  \"I knew the pressure of the hand,\" said the General.\"\\n\"The saddlecame from the Prince.\"\\n I am so certain of it that I could invite thatdomino to dinner.\"\\n  \"Do so.\"\\nIf it be the Prince he will certainly come,\" replied theCount.\"\\n \"And if it is the other he will not come,\" said the General, andapproached the black  domino, who was just speaking with the King.The General gave a very respectful  invitation \"that they might makeeach other\\'s acquaintance,\" and he smiled in his  certaintyconcerning the person he was inviting.\"\\nHe spoke loud and distinctly.\"\\n The domino raised his mask, and it was George.\"\\n\"Do you repeat yourinvitation,  General?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n The General certainly seemed to grow an inch taller, assumed amore stately demeanor,  and took two steps backward and one stepforward, as if he were dancing a minuet, and  then came as much gravityand expression into the face of the General as the General  couldcontrive to infuse into it; but he replied,  \"I never retract my words!\"\\nYou are invited, Professor!\"\\n and hebowed with a glance  at the King, who must have heard the wholedialogue.\"\\n Now, there was a company to dinner at the General\\'s, but onlythe old Count and his  protege were invited.\"\\n \"I have my foot under his table,\" thought George.\"\\n\"That\\'s layingthe foundation stone.\"\\n  And the foundation stone was really laid, with great ceremony,at the house of the  General and of the General\\'s lady.\"\\n The man had come, and had spoken quite like a person in goodsociety, and had made  himself very agreeable, so that the Generalhad often to repeat his \"Charming!\"\\n The  General talked of this dinner,talked of it even to a court lady; and this lady, one  of the mostintellectual persons about the court, asked to be invited to meetthe  Professor the next time he should come.\"\\nSo he had to be invitedagain; and he was invited,  and came, and was charming again; hecould even play chess.\"\\n \"He\\'s not out of the cellar,\" said the General; \"he\\'s quite adistinguished person.\"\\n There are many distinguished persons of thatkind, and it\\'s no fault of his.\"\\n  The Professor, who was received in the King\\'s palace, might verywell be received by  the General; but that he could ever belong tothe house was out of the question, only  the whole town was talkingof it.\"\\n He grew and grew.\"\\nThe dew of favor fell from above, so no onewas surprised after all  that he should become a Privy Councillor,and Emily a Privy Councillor\\'s lady.\"\\n \"Life is either a tragedy or a comedy,\" said the General.\"\\n\"Intragedies they die, in  comedies they marry one another.\"\\n  In this case they married.\"\\nAnd they had three clever boys- but notall at once.\"\\n The sweet children rode on their hobby-horses through all therooms when they came  to see the grandparents.\"\\nAnd the General alsorode on his stick; he rode behind them  in the character of groom tothe little Privy Councillors.\"\\n And the General\\'s lady sat on her sofa and smiled at them, evenwhen she had her severest  headache.\"\\n So far did George get, and much further; else it had not beenworth while to tell the  story of THE PORTER\\'S SON.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PORTUGUESE DUCK  by Hans Christian Andersen  A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who saidshe came from Spain,  which is almost the same thing.\"\\nAt all events,she was called the \"Portuguese,\" and  she laid eggs, was killed, andcooked, and there was an end of her.\"\\nBut the ducklings  which creptforth from the eggs were also called \"Portuguese,\" and about thatthere  may be some question.\"\\nBut of all the family one only remained inthe duckyard, which  may be called a farmyard, as the chickens wereadmitted, and the cock strutted about  in a very hostile manner.\"\\n\"Heannoys me with his loud crowing,\" said the Portuguese  duck; \"but,still, he\\'s a handsome bird, there\\'s no denying that, although he\\'snot  a drake.\"\\nHe ought to moderate his voice, like those little birdswho are singing in  the lime-trees over there in our neighbor\\'s garden,but that is an art only acquired  in polite society.\"\\nHow sweetly theysing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to  them!\"\\nI call itPortuguese singing.\"\\nIf I had only such a little singing-bird, I\\'d bekind  and good as a mother to him, for it\\'s in my nature, in myPortuguese blood.\"\\n  While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds cametumbling head over heels  from the roof into the yard.\"\\nThe cat wasafter him, but he had escaped from her with  a broken wing, and so cametumbling into the yard.\"\\n\"That\\'s just like the cat, she\\'s  a villain,\"said the Portuguese duck.\"\\n\"I remember her ways when I had childrenof my  own.\"\\nHow can such a creature be allowed to live, and wanderabout upon the roofs.\"\\nI  don\\'t think they allow such things inPortugal.\"\\n She pitied the little singing-bird,  and so did all theother ducks who were not Portuguese.\"\\n \"Poor little creature!\"\\n they said, one after another, as they cameup.\"\\n\"We can\\'t sing,  certainly; but we have a sounding-board, orsomething of the kind, within us; we can  feel that, though we don\\'ttalk about it.\"\\n  \"But I can talk,\" said the Portuguese duck; \"and I\\'ll do somethingfor the little fellow;  it\\'s my duty;\" and she stepped into thewater-trough, and beat her wings upon the water  so strongly that thebird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the duck meant  itkindly.\"\\n\"That is a good deed,\" she said; \"I hope the others willtake example by  it.\"\\n  \"Tweet, tweet!\"\\n said the little bird, for one of his wings beingbroken, he found it  difficult to shake himself; but he quiteunderstood that the bath was meant kindly,  and he said, \"You arevery kind-hearted, madam;\" but he did not wish for a second bath.\"\\n \"I have never thought about my heart,\" replied the Portugueseduck, \"but I know that  I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat,and nobody can expect me to love her,  for she ate up two of myducklings.\"\\nBut pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make  one\\'sself comfortable.\"\\nI am myself from a foreign country, as you may seeby my feathery  dress.\"\\nMy drake is a native of these parts; he\\'s not ofmy race; but I am not proud  on that account.\"\\nIf any one here canunderstand you, I may say positively I am that  person.\"\\n  \"She\\'s quite full of \\'Portulak,\\'\" said a little common duck, whowas witty.\"\\nAll the  common ducks considered the word \"Portulak\" agood joke, for it sounded like Portugal.\"\\n They nudged each other, andsaid, \"Quack!\"\\nthat was witty!\"\\n  Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird.\"\\n\"ThePortuguese had certainly  a great flow of language,\" they said to thelittle bird.\"\\n\"For our part we don\\'t care  to fill our beaks with suchlong words, but we sympathize with you quite as much.\"\\nIf  we don\\'t doanything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and we thinkthat  is the best thing we can do.\"\\n  \"You have a lovely voice,\" said one of the eldest ducks; \"itmust be great satisfaction  to you to be able to give so muchpleasure as you do.\"\\nI am certainly no judge of your  singing so Ikeep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as othersdo.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; \"he requiresrest and nursing.\"\\n My little singing-bird do you wish me to prepareanother bath for you?\"\\n  \"Oh, no!\"\\nno!\"\\npray let me dry,\" implored the little bird.\"\\n \"The water-cure is the only remedy for me, when I am not well,\"said the Portuguese.\"\\n \"Amusement, too, is very beneficial.\"\\nThe fowlsfrom the neighborhood will soon be here  to pay you a visit.\"\\nThereare two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear feathers on  their legs,and are well educated.\"\\nThey have been brought from a great distance,and  consequently I treat them with greater respect than I do theothers.\"\\n  Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day tokeep from being rude.\"\\n \"You are a real songster,\" he said, \"you do asmuch with your little voice as it is  possible to do; but thererequires more noise and shrillness in any one who wishes  it to beknown who he is.\"\\n  The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of thesinging-bird.\"\\nHis  feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, sothat he seemed to them quite like a  tiny Chinese fowl.\"\\n\"He\\'scharming,\" they said to each other, and began a conversation  withhim in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: \"Weare of the same  race as yourself,\" they said.\"\\n\"The ducks, even thePortuguese, are all aquatic birds,  as you must have noticed.\"\\nYou donot know us yet,- very few know us, or give themselves  the troubleto make our acquaintance, not even any of the fowls, though we areborn  to occupy a higher grade in society than most of them.\"\\nBut thatdoes not disturb us,  we quietly go on in our own way among the rest,whose ideas are certainly not ours;  for we look at the bright sideof things, and only speak what is good, although that  is sometimesvery difficult to find where none exists.\"\\nExcept ourselves and thecock  there is not one in the yard who can be called talented orpolite.\"\\nIt cannot even be  said of the ducks, and we warn you, littlebird, not to trust that one yonder, with  the short tail feathers,for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the  crookedstripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one havethe last  word, though she is always in the wrong.\"\\nThat fat duck yonderspeaks evil of every  one, and that is against our principles.\"\\nIf wehave nothing good to tell, we close  our beaks.\"\\nThe Portuguese is theonly one who has had any education, and with whom  we can associate,but she is passionate, and talks too much about \\'Portugal.\\'\"  \"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about,\"whispered one duck to another;  \"they are always doing it, and itannoys me.\"\\nWe never speak to them.\"\\n  Now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing-birdwas a sparrow.\"\\n\"Well,  I don\\'t understand the difference,\" he said; \"itappears to me all the same.\"\\nHe\\'s only  a plaything, and if peoplewill have playthings, why let them, I say.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t take any notice of what he says,\" whispered the Portuguese;\"he\\'s very well  in matters of business, and with him business isplaced before everything.\"\\nBut now  I shall lie down and have a littlerest.\"\\nIt is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may  be nice and fatwhen we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples.\"\\n So shelaid  herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a verycomfortable place,  and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep.\"\\nThelittle singing-bird busied himself  for some time with his broken wing,and at last he lay down, too, quite close to his  protectress.\"\\nThesun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very  goodplace.\"\\nBut the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, totell the truth,  they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply andsolely to find food for themselves.\"\\n The Chinese were the first toleave, and the other fowls soon followed them.\"\\n The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old ladywas getting quite a  \"doting ducky,\" All the other ducks laughed atthis.\"\\n\"Doting ducky,\" they whispered.\"\\n \"Oh, that\\'s too \\'witty!\\'\" Andthen they repeated the former joke about \"Portulak,\"  and declared itwas most amusing.\"\\nThen they all lay down to have a nap.\"\\n They had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenlysomething was thrown into the  yard for them to eat.\"\\nIt came downwith such a bang, that the whole company started  up and clappedtheir wings.\"\\nThe Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the otherside:  in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.\"\\n \"Tweet,\" he cried; \"you trod very hard upon me, madam.\"\\n  \"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?\"\\n she retorted, \"you mustnot be so touchy.\"\\nI  have nerves of my own, but I do not cry \\'tweet.\\'\"  \"Don\\'t be angry,\" said the little bird;

\"youmust conform to the rules  of the house while you are here.\"\\nI want tosleep now.\"\\n  The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly.When madam awoke  afterwards, there he stood before her with a littlecorn he had found, and laid it  at her feet; but as she had not sleptwell, she was naturally in a bad temper.\"\\n\"Give  that to a chicken,\" shesaid, \"and don\\'t be always standing in my way.\"\\n  \"Why are you angry with me?\"\\n replied the little singing-bird,\"what have I done?\"\\n  \"Done!\"\\n repeated the Portuguese duck, \"your mode of expressingyourself is not very  polite.\"\\nI must call your attention to that fact.\"\\n  \"It was sunshine here yesterday,\" said the little bird, \"butto-day it is cloudy and  the air is close.\"\\n  \"You know very little about the weather, I fancy,\" she retorted,\"the day is not over  yet.\"\\nDon\\'t stand there, looking so stupid.\"\\n  \"But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when Ifell into the yard  yesterday.\"\\n  \"Impertinent creature!\"\\n exclaimed the Portuguese duck: \"wouldyou compare me with the  cat- that beast of prey?\"\\nThere\\'s not a drop ofmalicious blood in me.\"\\nI\\'ve taken your  part, and now I\\'ll teach youbetter manners.\"\\n So saying, she made a bite at the  littlesinging-bird\\'s head, and he fell dead on the ground.\"\\n\"Now whateveris the meaning  of this?\"\\n \"she said; \"could he not bear even such alittle peck as I gave him?\"\\nThen  certainly he was not made for thisworld.\"\\nI\\'ve been like a mother to him, I know that,  for I\\'ve a goodheart.\"\\n  Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in, andcrowed with steam-engine  power.\"\\n \"You\\'ll kill me with your crowing,\" she cried, \"it\\'s all yourfault.\"\\nHe\\'s lost his  life, and I\\'m very near losing mine.\"\\n  \"There\\'s not much of him lying there,\" observed the cock.\"\\n \"Speak of him with respect,\" said the Portuguese duck, \"for he hadmanners and  education, and he could sing.\"\\nHe was affectionate andgentle, and that is as rare a  quality in animals as in those whocall themselves human beings.\"\\n  Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird.\"\\nDuckshave strong passions,  whether they feel envy or pity.\"\\nThere wasnothing to envy here, so they all showed  a great deal of pity, eventhe two Chinese.\"\\n\"We shall never have another singing-bird  againamongst us;

but she would have  to be a real princess.\"\\nHe travelled allover the world to find one, but nowhere could  he get what he wanted.There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out  whetherthey were real ones.\"\\nThere was always something about them that wasnot as it  should be.\"\\nSo he came home again and was sad, for he wouldhave liked very much to  have a real princess.\"\\n One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder andlightning, and the rain  poured down in torrents.\"\\nSuddenly a knockingwas heard at the city gate, and the old  king went to open it.\"\\n It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate.\"\\nBut,good gracious!\"\\nwhat  a sight the rain and the wind had made her look.The water ran down from her hair and  clothes; it ran down into thetoes of her shoes and out again at the heels.\"\\nAnd yet  she said thatshe was a real princess.\"\\n \"Well, we\\'ll soon find that out,\" thought the old queen.\"\\nBut shesaid nothing, went  into the bed-room, took all the bedding off thebedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom;  then she took twentymattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down  bedson top of the mattresses.\"\\n On this the princess had to lie all night.\"\\nIn the morning shewas asked how she had  slept.\"\\n \"Oh, very badly!\"\\n said she.\"\\n\"I have scarcely closed my eyes allnight.\"\\nHeaven only  knows what was in the bed, but I was lying onsomething hard, so that I am black and  blue all over my body.\"\\nIt\\'shorrible!\"\\n  Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had feltthe pea right through  the twenty mattresses and the twentyeider-down beds.\"\\n Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.\"\\n So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had areal princess; and  the pea was put in the museum, where it may stillbe seen, if no one has stolen it.\"\\n There, that is a true story.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE PSYCHE  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the fresh morning dawn, in the rosy air gleams a great Star,the brightest Star  of the morning.\"\\nHis rays tremble on the white wall,as if he wished to write down on  it what he can tell, what he has seenthere and elsewhere during thousands of years  in our rolling world.Let us hear one of his stories.\"\\n \"A short time ago\"- the Star\\'s \"short time ago\" is called amongmen \"centuries ago\"-  \"my rays followed a young artist.\"\\nIt was in thecity of the Popes, in the world-city,  Rome.\"\\nMuch has been changedthere in the course of time, but the changes have not come  soquickly as the change from youth to old age.\"\\nThen already the palaceof the Caesars  was a ruin, as it is now; fig trees and laurels grewamong the fallen marble columns,  and in the desolate bathing-halls,where the gilding still clings to the wall; the  Coliseum was agigantic ruin; the church bells sounded, the incense sent up itsfragrant  cloud, and through the streets marched processions withflaming tapers and glowing  canopies.\"\\nHoly Church was there, and artwas held as a high and holy thing.\"\\nIn Rome  lived the greatestpainter in the world, Raphael; there also dwelt the first  ofsculptors, Michael Angelo.\"\\nEven the Pope paid homage to these two, andhonored them  with a visit.\"\\nArt was recognized and honored, and wasrewarded also.\"\\nBut, for all that,  everything great and splendid wasnot seen and known.\"\\n \"In a narrow lane stood an old house.\"\\nOnce it had been a temple; ayoung sculptor now  dwelt there.\"\\nHe was young and quite unknown.\"\\nHecertainly had friends, young artists,  like himself, young in spirit,young in hopes and thoughts; they told him he was rich  in talent,and an artist, but that he was foolish for having no faith in hisown power;  for he always broke what he had fashioned out of clay,and never completed anything;  and a work must be completed if it is tobe seen and to bring money.\"\\n \"\\'You are a dreamer,\\' they went on to say to him, \\'and that\\'s yourmisfortune.\"\\nBut  the reason of this is, that you have never lived,you have never tasted life, you have  never enjoyed it in greatwholesome draughts, as it ought to be enjoyed.\"\\nIn youth one  mustmingle one\\'s own personality with life, that they may become one.\"\\nLookat the great  master Raphael, whom the Pope honors and the worldadmires.\"\\nHe\\'s no despiser of wine  and bread.\\'  \"\\'And he even appreciates the baker\\'s daughter, the prettyFornarina,\\' added Angelo,  one of the merriest of the young friends.\"\\n \"Yes, they said a good many things of the kind, according to theirage and their reason.\"\\n They wanted to draw the young artist out withthem into the merry wild life, the mad  life as it might also becalled; and at certain times he felt an inclination for it.\"\\n He hadwarm blood, a strong imagination, and could take part in the merrychat, and  laugh aloud with the rest; but what they called \\'Raphael\\'smerry life\\' disappeared  before him like a vapor when he saw the divineradiance that beamed forth from the  pictures of the great master;and when he stood in the Vatican, before the forms of  beauty which themasters had hewn out of marble thousands of years since, his  breastswelled, and he felt within himself something high, something holy,something  elevating, great and good, and he wished that he couldproduce similar forms from the  blocks of marble.\"\\nHe wished to make apicture of that which was within him, stirring  upward from his heartto the realms of the Infinite; but how, and in what form?\"\\nThe  softclay was fashioned under his fingers into forms of beauty, but thenext day he  broke what he had fashioned, according to his wont.\"\\n \"One day he walked past one of those rich palaces of which Romehas many to show.\"\\nHe  stopped before the great open portal, andbeheld a garden surrounded by cloistered  walks.\"\\nThe garden bloomedwith a goodly show of the fairest roses.\"\\nGreat white lilies  with greenjuicy leaves shot upward from the marble basin in which the clearwater was  splashing; and a form glided past, the daughter of theprincely house, graceful,  delicate, and wonderfully fair.\"\\nSuch aform of female loveliness he had never before  beheld- yet stay: he hadseen it, painted by Raphael, painted as a Psyche, in one of  theRoman palaces.\"\\nYes, there it had been painted; but here it passed byhim in living  reality.\"\\n \"The remembrance lived in his thoughts, in his heart.\"\\nHe went hometo his humble room,  and modelled a Psyche of clay.\"\\nIt was the richyoung Roman girl, the noble maiden;  and for the first time he lookedat his work with satisfaction.\"\\nIt had a meaning for  him, for it wasshe.\"\\nAnd the friends who saw his work shouted aloud for joy;  theydeclared that this work was a manifestation of his artistic power,of which they  had long been aware, and that now the world should bemade aware of it too.\"\\n \"The clay figure was lifelike and beautiful, but it had not thewhiteness or the  durability of marble.\"\\nSo they declared that thePsyche must henceforth live in marble.\"\\n He already possessed a costlyblock of that stone.\"\\nIt had been lying for years, the  property ofhis parents, in the courtyard.\"\\nFragments of glass, climbing weeds,  andremains of artichokes had gathered about it and sullied its purity;but under the  surface the block was as white as the mountain snow; andfrom this block the Psyche  was to arise.\"\\n  Now, it happened one morning- the bright Star tells nothingabout this, but we know  it occurred- that a noble Roman company cameinto the narrow lane.\"\\nThe carriage stopped  at the top of the lane, andthe company proceeded on foot towards the house, to inspect  theyoung sculptor\\'s work, for they had heard him spoken of by chance.\"\\nAndwho were  these distinguished guests?\"\\nPoor young man!\"\\nor fortunateyoung man he might be called.\"\\n The noble young lady stood in the roomand smiled radiantly when her father said to  her, \"It is your livingimage.\"\\n That smile could not be copied, any more than the look  couldbe reproduced, the wonderful look which she cast upon the youngartist.\"\\nIt was  a fiery look, that seemed at once to elevate and tocrush him.\"\\n \"The Psyche must be executed in marble,\" said the wealthypatrician.\"\\nAnd those were  words of life for the dead clay and theheavy block of marble, and words of life likewise  for the deeply-movedartist.\"\\n\"When the work is finished I will purchase it,\"  continuedthe rich noble.\"\\n A new era seemed to have arisen in the poor studio.\"\\nLife andcheerfulness gleamed there,  and busy industry plied its work.\"\\nThebeaming Morning Star beheld how the work  progressed.\"\\nThe clay itselfseemed inspired since she had been there, and moulded  itself, inheightened beauty, to a likeness of the well-known features.\"\\n \"Now I know what life is,\" cried the artist rejoicingly; \"it isLove!\"\\nIt is the lofty  abandonment of self for the dawning of thebeautiful in the soul!\"\\nWhat my friends call  life and enjoyment is apassing shadow; it is like bubbles among seething dregs, not  thepure heavenly wine that consecrates us to life.\"\\n  The marble block was reared in its place.\"\\nThe chisel struckgreat fragments from it;  the measurements were taken, points and lineswere made, the mechanical part was  executed, till gradually thestone assumed a human female form, a shape of beauty,  and becameconverted into the Psyche, fair and glorious- a divine being inhuman shape.\"\\n The heavy stone appeared as a gliding, dancing, airyPsyche, with the heavenly innocent  smile- the smile that hadmirrored itself in the soul of the young artist.\"\\n The Star of the roseate dawn beheld and understood what wasstirring within the young  man, and could read the meaning of thechanging color of his cheek, of the light that  flashed from his eye,as he stood busily working, reproducing what had been put into  hissoul from above.\"\\n \"Thou art a master like those masters among the ancient Greeks,\"exclaimed his  delighted friends; \"soon shall the whole world admirethy Psyche.\"\\n  \"My Psyche!\"\\n he repeated.\"\\n\"Yes, mine.\"\\nShe must be mine.\"\\nI, too, aman artist, like  those great men who are gone.\"\\nProvidence has grantedme the boon, and has made me the  equal of that lady of noble birth.\"\\n  And he knelt down and breathed a prayer of thankfulnesss toHeaven, and then he forgot  Heaven for her sake- for the sake of herpicture in stone- for her Psyche which stood  there as if formed ofsnow, blushing in the morning dawn.\"\\n He was to see her in reality, the living, graceful Psyche, whosewords sounded like  music in his ears.\"\\nHe could now carry the news intothe rich palace that the marble  Psyche was finished.\"\\nHe betook himselfthither, strode through the open courtyard  where the waters ransplashing from the dolphin\\'s jaws into the marble basins, where  thesnowy lilies and the fresh roses bloomed in abundance.\"\\nHe stepped intothe great  lofty hall, whose walls and ceilings shone with gildingand bright colors and heraldic  devices.\"\\nGayly-dressed serving-men,adorned with trappings like sleigh horses, walked  to and fro, and somereclined at their ease upon the carved oak seats, as if they werethe  masters of the house.\"\\nHe told them what had brought him to thepalace, and was conducted  up the shining marble staircase, coveredwith soft carpets and adorned with many a  statue.\"\\nThen he went onthrough richly-furnished chambers, over mosaic floors, amid  gorgeouspictures.\"\\nAll this pomp and luxury seemed to weary him; but soon hefelt  relieved, for the princely old master of the house received himmost graciously,,  almost heartily; and when he took his leave he wasrequested to step into the Signora\\'s  apartment, for she, too, wishedto see him.\"\\nThe servants led him through more luxurious  halls andchambers into her room, where she appeared the chief and leadingornament.\"\\n She spoke to him.\"\\nNo hymn of supplication, no holy chant, couldmelt his soul like  the sound of her voice.\"\\nHe took her hand and liftedit to his lips.\"\\nNo rose was softer,  but a fire thrilled through himfrom this rose- a feeling of power came upon him, and  words pouredfrom his tongue- he knew not what he said.\"\\nDoes the crater of thevolcano  know that the glowing lava is pouring from it?\"\\nHe confessedwhat he felt for her.\"\\nShe  stood before him astonished, offended,proud, with contempt in her face, an expression  of disgust, as ifshe had suddenly touched a cold unclean reptile.\"\\nHer cheeksreddened,  her lips grew white, and her eyes flashed fire, thoughthey were dark as the blackness  of night.\"\\n \"Madman!\"\\n she cried, \"away!\"\\nbegone!\"\\n  And she turned her back upon him.\"\\nHer beautiful face wore anexpression like that of  the stony countenance with the snaky locks.\"\\n Like a stricken, fainting man, he tottered down the staircaseand out into the street.\"\\n Like a man walking in his sleep, he found hisway back to his dwelling.\"\\nThen he woke  up to madness and agony, andseized his hammer, swung it high in the air, and rushed  forward toshatter the beautiful marble image.\"\\nBut, in his pain, he had notnoticed  that his friend Angelo stood beside him; and Angelo heldback his arm with a strong  grasp, crying,  \"Are you mad?\"\\nWhat are you about?\"\\n  They struggled together.\"\\nAngelo was the stronger; and, with a deepsigh of exhaustion,  the young artist threw himself into a chair.\"\\n \"What has happened?\"\\n asked Angelo.\"\\n\"Command yourself.\"\\nSpeak!\"\\n  But what could he say?\"\\nHow could he explain?\"\\nAnd as Angelo couldmake no sense of his  friend\\'s incoherent words, he forbore to questionhim further, and merely said,  \"Your blood grows thick from your eternal dreaming.\"\\nBe a man, asall others are, and  don\\'t go on living in ideals, for that is whatdrives men crazy.\"\\nA jovial feast will  make you sleep quietly andhappily.\"\\nBelieve me, the time will come when you will be  old, and yoursinews will shrink, and then, on some fine sunshiny day, wheneverything  is laughing and rejoicing, you will lie there a fadedplant, that will grow no more.\"\\n I do not live in dreams, but inreality.\"\\nCome with me.\"\\nBe a man!\"\\n  And he drew the artist away with him.\"\\nAt this moment he was ableto do so, for a fire  ran in the blood of the young sculptor; achange had taken place in his soul; he felt  a longing to tear from theold, the accustomed- to forget, if possible, his own  individuality;and therefore it was that he followed Angelo.\"\\n In an out-of-the-way suburb of Rome lay a tavern much visited byartists.\"\\nIt was built  on the ruins of some ancient baths.\"\\nThe greatyellow citrons hung down among the dark  shining leaves, and covereda part of the old reddish-yellow walls.\"\\nThe tavern  consisted of avaulted chamber, almost like a cavern, in the ruins.\"\\nA lamp burnedthere  before the picture of the Madonna.\"\\nA great fire gleamed on thehearth, and roasting  and boiling was going on there; without, underthe citron trees and laurels, stood  a few covered tables.\"\\n The two artists were received by their friends with shouts ofwelcome.\"\\nLittle was eaten,  but much was drunk, and the spirits ofthe company rose.\"\\nSongs were sung and ditties  were played on theguitar; presently the Salterello sounded, and the merry dance  began.Two young Roman girls, who sat as models to the artists, took partin the dance  and in the festivity.\"\\nTwo charming Bacchantes werethey; certainly not Psyches- not  delicate, beautiful roses, but fresh,hearty, glowing carnations.\"\\n How hot it was on that day!\"\\nEven after sundown it was hot.\"\\nTherewas fire in the blood,  fire in every glance, fire everywhere.\"\\nTheair gleamed with gold and roses, and life  seemed like gold and roses.\"\\n \"At last you have joined us, for once,\" said his friends.\"\\n\"Now letyourself be carried  by the waves within and around you.\"\\n  \"Never yet have I felt so well, so merry!\"\\n cried the young artist.\"\\nYou are right\\ufffeyou are all of you right.\"\\nI was a fool- a dreamer.\"\\nManbelongs to reality, and not  to fancy.\"\\n  With songs and with sounding guitars the young people returnedthat evening from the  tavern, through the narrow streets; the twoglowing carnations, daughters of the  Campagna, went with them.\"\\n In Angelo\\'s room, among a litter of colored sketches (studies) andglowing pictures,  the voices sounded mellower, but not less merrily.On the ground lay many a sketch  that resembled the daughters of theCampagna, in their fresh, hearty comeliness, but  the two originalswere far handsomer than their portraits.\"\\nAll the burners of  thesix-armed lamp flared and flamed; and the human flamed up from within,and appeared  in the glare as if it were divine.\"\\n \"Apollo!\"\\nJupiter!\"\\nI feel myself raised to our heaven- to yourglory!\"\\nI feel as if the  blossom of life were unfolding itself in myveins at this moment!\"\\n  Yes, the blossom unfolded itself, and then burst and fell, andan evil vapor arose  from it, blinding the sight, leading astray thefancy; the firework of the senses went  out, and it became dark.\"\\n He was again in his own room.\"\\nThere he sat down on his bed andcollected his thoughts.\"\\n \"Fie on thee!\"\\n these were the words that sounded out of hismouth from the depths of  his heart.\"\\n\"Wretched man, go, begone!\"\\n Anda deep painful sigh burst from his bosom.\"\\n \"Away!\"\\nbegone!\"\\n These, her words, the words of the livingPsyche, echoed through his  heart, escaped from his lips.\"\\nHe buried hishead in the pillows, his thoughts grew  confused, and he fell asleep.\"\\n In the morning dawn he started up, and collected his thoughtsanew.\"\\nWhat had happened?\"\\n Had all the past been a dream?\"\\nThe visit toher, the feast at the tavern, the evening  with the purple carnationsof the Campagna?\"\\nNo, it was all real- a reality he had never  beforeexperienced.\"\\n In the purple air gleamed the bright Star, and its beams fell uponhim and upon the  marble Psyche.\"\\nHe trembled as he looked at thatpicture of immortality, and his glance  seemed impure to him.\"\\nHethrew the cloth over the statue, and then touched it once  more tounveil the form- but he was not able to look again at his own work.\"\\n Gloomy, quiet, absorbed in his own thoughts, he sat therethrough the long day; he  heard nothing of what was going on aroundhim, and no man guessed what was passing  in this human soul.\"\\n And days and weeks went by, but the nights passed more slowly thanthe days.\"\\nThe  flashing Star beheld him one morning as he rose, paleand trembling with fever, from  his sad couch; then he steppedtowards the statue, threw back the covering, took one  long,sorrowful gaze at his work, and then, almost sinking beneath theburden, he  dragged the statue out into the garden.\"\\nIn that place wasan old dry well, now nothing  but a hole.\"\\nInto this he cast the Psyche,threw earth in above her, and covered up  the spot with twigs andnettles.\"\\n \"Away!\"\\nbegone!\"\\n Such was the short epitaph he spoke.\"\\n The Star beheld all this from the pink morning sky, and its beamtrembled upon two  great tears upon the pale feverish cheeks of theyoung man; and soon it was said that  he was sick unto death, and helay stretched upon a bed of pain.\"\\n The convent Brother Ignatius visited him as a physician and afriend, and brought him  words of comfort, of religion, and spoke tohim of the peace and happiness of the church,  of the sinfulness ofman, of rest and mercy to be found in heaven.\"\\n And the words fell like warm sunbeams upon a teeming soil.\"\\nThesoil smoked and sent  up clouds of mist, fantastic pictures, picturesin which there was reality; and from  these floating islands helooked across at human life.\"\\nHe found it vanity and delusion\\ufffeandvanity and delusion it had been to him.\"\\nThey told him that art was asorcerer,  betraying us to vanity and to earthly lusts; that we arefalse to ourselves, unfaithful  to our friends, unfaithful towardsHeaven; and that the serpent was always repeating  within us, \"Eat, andthou shalt become as God.\"\\n  And it appeared to him as if now, for the first time, he knewhimself, and had found  the way that leads to truth and to peace.\"\\nInthe church was the light and the brightness  of God- in the monk\\'s cellhe should find the rest through which the tree of human  life mightgrow on into eternity.\"\\n Brother Ignatius strengthened his longings, and thedetermination became firm within  him.\"\\nA child of the world became aservant of the church- the young artist renounced  the world, andretired into the cloister.\"\\n The brothers came forward affectionately to welcome him, and hisinauguration was as  a Sunday feast.\"\\nHeaven seemed to him to dwell inthe sunshine of the church, and to  beam upon him from the holypictures and from the cross.\"\\nAnd when, in the evening,  at the sunsethour, he stood in his little cell, and, opening the window, looked outupon  old Rome, upon the desolated temples, and the great deadColiseum- when he saw all  this in its spring garb, when the acaciasbloomed, and the ivy was fresh, and roses  burst forth everywhere,and the citron and orange were in the height of their beauty,  andthe palm trees waved their branches- then he felt a deeper emotionthan had ever  yet thrilled through him.\"\\nThe quiet open Campagna spreaditself forth towards the blue  snow-covered mountains, which seemedto be painted in the air; all the outlines melting  into each other,breathing peace and beauty, floating, dreaming- and all appearing  likea dream!\"\\n Yes, this world was a dream, and the dream lasts for hours, andmay return for hours;  but convent life is a life of years- long years,and many years.\"\\n From within comes much that renders men sinful and impure.\"\\nHefully realized the truth  of this.\"\\nWhat flames arose up in him attimes!\"\\nWhat a source of evil, of that which  we would not, welled upcontinually!\"\\nHe mortified his body, but the evil came from  within.\"\\n One day, after the lapse of many years, he met Angelo, whorecognized him.\"\\n \"Man!\"\\n exclaimed Angelo.\"\\n\"Yes, it is thou!\"\\nArt thou happy now?Thou hast sinned against  God, and cast away His boon from thee- hastneglected thy mission in this world!\"\\nRead  the parable of the intrustedtalent!\"\\nThe MASTER, who spoke that parable, spoke the  truth!\"\\nWhat hastthou gained?\"\\nWhat hast thou found?\"\\nDost thou not fashion for thyself  areligion and a dreamy life after thine own idea, as almost all do?Suppose all this  is a dream, a fair delusion!\"\\n  \"Get thee away from me, Satan!\"\\n said the monk; and he quittedAngelo.\"\\n \"There is a devil, a personal devil!\"\\nThis day I have seen him!\"\\nsaid the monk to himself.\"\\n \"Once I extended a finger to him, and hetook my whole hand.\"\\nBut now,\" he sighed, \"the  evil is within me, andit is in yonder man; but it does not bow him down; he goes abroad  withhead erect, and enjoys his comfort; and I grasped at comfort in theconsolations  of religion.\"\\nIf it were nothing but a consolation?Supposing everything here were,  like the world I have quitted, onlya beautiful fancy, a delusion like the beauty of  the evening clouds,like the misty blue of the distant hills!- when you approach  them,they are very different!\"\\nO eternity!\"\\nThou actest like the great calmocean, that  beckons us, and fills us with expectation- and when weembark upon thee, we sink,  disappear, and cease to be.\"\\nDelusion!away with it!\"\\nbegone!\"\\n  And tearless, but sunk in bitter reflection, he sat upon hishard couch, and then knelt  down- before whom?\"\\nBefore the stone crossfastened to the wall?\"\\nNo, it was only habit  that made him take thisposition.\"\\n The more deeply he looked into his own heart, the blacker didthe darkness seem.\"\\n -\"Nothing within, nothing without- this lifesquanderied and cast away!\"\\n And this  thought rolled and grew like asnowball, until it seemed to crush him.\"\\n \"I can confide my griefs to none.\"\\nI may speak to none of thegnawing worm within.\"\\nMy  secret is my prisoner; if I let the captiveescape, I shall be his!\"\\n  And the godlike power that dwelt within him suffered and strove.\"\\n \"O Lord, my Lord!\"\\n he cried, in his despair, \"be merciful andgrant me faith.\"\\nI threw  away the gift thou hadst vouchsafed to me, Ileft my mission unfulfilled.\"\\nI lacked  strength, and strength thoudidst not give me.\"\\nImmortality- the Psyche in my breast\\ufffeaway withit!- it shall be buried like that Psyche, the best gleam of my life;never  will it arise out of its grave!\"\\n  The Star glowed in the roseate air, the Star that shall surelybe extinguished and  pass away while the soul still lives on; itstrembling beam fell upon the white wall,  but it wrote nothing thereupon being made perfect in God, nothing of the hope of mercy,  of thereliance on the divine love that thrills through the heart of thebeliever.\"\\n \"The Psyche within can never die.\"\\nShall it live inconsciousness?\"\\nCan the  incomprehensible happen?\"\\nYes, yes.\"\\nMy beingis incomprehensible.\"\\nThou art  unfathomable, O Lord.\"\\nThy whole world isincomprehensible- a wonder-work of power,  of glory and of love.\"\\n  His eyes gleamed, and then closed in death.\"\\nThe tolling of thechurch bell was the  last sound that echoed above him, above the deadman; and they buried him, covering  him with earth that had beenbrought from Jerusalem, and in which was mingled the dust  of many ofthe pious dead.\"\\n When years had gone by his skeleton was dug up, as the skeletonsof the monks who had  died before him had been; it was clad in abrown frock, a rosary was put into the bony  hand, and the form wasplaced among the ranks of other skeletons in the cloisters of  theconvent.\"\\nAnd the sun shone without, while within the censers werewaved and the  Mass was celebrated.\"\\n And years rolled by.\"\\n The bones fell asunder and became mingled with others.\"\\nSkulls werepiled up till they  formed an outer wall around the church; and therelay also his head in the burning  sun, for many dead were there, and noone knew their names, and his name was forgotten  also.\"\\nAnd see,something was moving in the sunshine, in the sightless cavernous  eyes!What might that be?\"\\nA sparkling lizard moved about in the skull,gliding in and  out through the sightless holes.\"\\nThe lizard nowrepresented all the life left in that  head, in which once greatthoughts, bright dreams, the love of art and of the glorious,  hadarisen, whence hot tears had rolled down, where hope and immortalityhad had their  being.\"\\nThe lizard sprang away and disappeared, and theskull itself crumbled to pieces  and became dust among dust.\"\\n Centuries passed away.\"\\nThe bright Star gleamed unaltered,radiant and large, as it  had gleamed for thousands of years, and theair glowed red with tints fresh as roses,  crimson like blood.\"\\n There, where once had stood the narrow lane containing the ruinsof the temple, a  nunnery was now built.\"\\nA grave was being dug in theconvent garden for a young nun  who had died, and was to be laid in theearth this morning.\"\\nThe spade struck against  a hard substance;

and  indeed he considered himselfso, for I heard it from his own mouth.\"\\nHe was a Dane,  the owner of atravelling theatre.\"\\nHe had all his company with him in a large box,for  he was the proprietor of a puppet-show.\"\\nHis inborn cheerfulness,he said, had been  tested by a member of the Polytechnic Institution,and the experiment had made him  completely happy.\"\\nI did not at firstunderstand all this, but afterwards he explained  the whole story tome; and here it is:-  \"I was giving a representation,\" he said, \"in the hall of theposting-house in the  little town of Slagelse; there was a splendidaudience, entirely juvenile excepting  two respectable matrons.\"\\nAllat once, a person in black, of student-like appearance,  entered theroom, and sat down; he laughed aloud at the telling points, andapplauded  quite at the proper time.\"\\nThis was a very unusualspectator for me, and I felt anxious  to know who he was.\"\\nI heardthat he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in  Copenhagen, whohad been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces.Punctually  at eight o\\'clock my performance closed, for children mustgo early to bed, and a manager  must also consult the convenience ofthe public.\"\\n \"At nine o\\'clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and hisexperiments, and then I  formed a part of his audience.\"\\nIt waswonderful both to hear and to see.\"\\nThe greater  part of it was beyondmy comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can acquire  somuch, we must surely be intended to last longer than the little spanwhich extends  only to the time when we are hidden away under theearth.\"\\nHis experiments were quite  miracles on a small scale, and yetthe explanations flowed as naturally as water from  his lips.\"\\nAt thetime of Moses and the prophets, such a man would have been placedamong  the sages of the land; in the middle ages they would haveburnt him at the stake.\"\\n \"All night long I could not sleep; and the next evening when Igave another performance  and the lecturer was present, I was in one ofmy best moods.\"\\n \"I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the part of alover, always thought  of one particular lady in the audience; heonly played for her, and forgot all the  rest of the house, and now thePolytechnic lecturer was my she, my only auditor, for  whom alone Iplayed.\"\\n \"When the performance was over, and the puppets removed behind thecurtain, the  Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his room to take aglass of wine.\"\\nHe talked of  my comedies, and I of his science, and Ibelieve we were both equally pleased.\"\\nBut  I had the best of it, forthere was much in what he did that he could not always explain  tome.\"\\nFor instance, why a piece of iron which is rubbed on a cylinder,should become  magnetic.\"\\nHow does this happen?\"\\nThe magnetic sparks cometo it,- but how?\"\\nIt is the  same with people in the world; they arerubbed about on this spherical globe till the  electric spark comesupon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or a Luther, or some one  ofthe kind.\"\\n \"\\'The whole world is but a series of miracles,\\' said the lecturer,\\'but we are so  accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters.\\'And he went on explaining  things to me till my skull seemed liftedfrom my brain, and I declared that were I  not such an old fellow, Iwould at once become a member of the Polytechnic Institution,  that Imight learn to look at the bright side of everything, although I wasone of the  happiest of men.\"\\n \"\\'One of the happiest!\\' said the lecturer, as if the ideapleased him; \\'are you really  happy?\\'  \"\\'Yes,\\' I replied; \\'for I am welcomed in every town, when I arrivewith my company;  but I certainly have one wish which sometimesweighs upon my cheerful temper like a  mountain of lead.\"\\nI shouldlike to become the manager of a real theatre, and the  director of areal troupe of men and women.\\'  \"\\'I understand,\\' he said; \\'you would like to have life breathedinto your puppets,  so that they might be living actors, and youtheir director.\"\\nAnd would you then be  quite happy?\\'  \"I said I believed so.\"\\nBut he did not; and we talked it over inall manner of ways,  yet could not agree on the subject.\"\\nHowever, thewine was excellent, and we clanked  our glasses together as we drank.There must have been magic in it, or I should most  certainly becometipsy; but that did not happen, for my mind seemed quite clear;  and,indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the room, and beamed from the eyesof the  Polytechnic lecturer.\"\\nIt made me think of the old storieswhen the gods, in their  immortal youth, wandered upon this earth,and paid visits to mankind.\"\\nI said so to  him, and he smiled; and Icould have sworn that he was one of these ancient deities  in disguise,or, at all events, that he belonged to the race of the gods.\"\\nTheresult  seemed to prove I was right in my suspicions; for it wasarranged that my highest wish  should be granted, that my puppetswere to be gifted with life, and that I was to be  the manager of areal company.\"\\nWe drank to my success, and clanked our glasses.\"\\nThen  hepacked all my dolls into the box, and fastened it on my back, and Ifelt as if I  were spinning round in a circle, and presently foundmyself lying on the floor.\"\\nI  remember that quite well.\"\\nAnd then thewhole company sprang from the box.\"\\nThe spirit  had come upon us all;the puppets had become distinguished actors- at least, so they  saidthemselves- and I was their director.\"\\n \"When all was ready for the first representation, the wholecompany requested  permission to speak to me before appearing inpublic.\"\\nThe dancing lady said the house  could not be supportedunless she stood on one leg; for she was a great genius, and  begged tobe treated as such.\"\\nThe lady who acted the part of the queenexpected to be  treated as a queen off the stage, as well as on it,or else she said she should get  out of practice.\"\\nThe man whose duty itwas to deliver a letter gave himself as many  airs as he who took thepart of first lover in the piece; he declared that the  inferiorparts were as important as the great ones, and deserving equalconsideration,  as parts of an artistic whole.\"\\nThe hero of the piecewould only play in a part containing  points likely to bring down theapplause of the house.\"\\nThe \\'prima donna\\' would only  act when thelights were red, for she declared that a blue light did not suit  hercomplexion.\"\\nIt was like a company of flies in a bottle, and I was inthe bottle  with them; for I was their director.\"\\nMy breath was takenaway, my head whirled, and  I was as miserable as a man could be.\"\\nItwas quite a novel, strange set of beings among  whom I now foundmyself.\"\\nI only wished I had them all in my box again, and that I hadnever  been their director.\"\\nSo I told them roundly that, after all,they were nothing but  puppets; and then they killed me.\"\\nAfter awhile I found myself lying on my bed in my  room; but how I gotthere, or how I got away at all from the Polytechnic professor,  he mayperhaps know, I don\\'t.\"\\nThe moon shone upon the floor, the box layopen, and the  dolls were all scattered about in great confusion; but Iwas not idle.\"\\nI jumped off  the bed, and into the box they all had togo, some on their heads, some on their feet.\"\\n Then I shut down the lid,and seated myself upon the box.\"\\n\\'Now you\\'ll have to stay,\\'  said I,\\'and I shall be cautious how I wish you flesh and blood again.\\'  \"I felt quite light, my cheerfulness had returned, and I was thehappiest of mortals.\"\\n The Polytechnic professor had fully cured me.\"\\nIwas as happy as a king, and went to  sleep on the box.\"\\nNext morning-correctly speaking, it was noon, for I slept remarkably  late that day-I found myself still sitting there, in happy consciousness that myformer  wish had been a foolish one.\"\\nI inquired for the Polytechnicprofessor; but he had  disappeared like the Greek and Roman gods;from that time I have been the happiest  man in the world.\"\\nI am a happydirector; for none of my company ever grumble, nor the  publiceither, for I always make them merry.\"\\nI can arrange my pieces justas I please.\"\\n I choose out of every comedy what I like best, and no oneis offended.\"\\nPlays that are  neglected now-a-days by the great publicwere ran after thirty years ago, and listened  to till the tears randown the cheeks of the audience.\"\\nThese are the pieces I bring  forward.I place them before the little ones, who cry over them as papa andmamma used  to cry thirty years ago.\"\\nBut I make them shorter, for theyoungsters don\\'t like long  speeches; and if they have anythingmournful, they like it to be over quickly.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE RACES  by Hans Christian Andersen  A PRIZE, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, hadbeen awarded for the  greatest swiftness in running,- not in a singlerace, but for the whole year.\"\\n \"I obtained the first prize,\" said the hare.\"\\n\"Justice must stillbe carried out, even  when one has relations and good friends among theprize committee; but that the snail  should have received the secondprize, I consider almost an insult to myself\"  \"No,\" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at thedistribution of prizes; \"there  should be some consideration forindustry and perseverance.\"\\nI have heard many  respectable people sayso, and I can quite understand it.\"\\nThe snail certainly took  half ayear to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself,and broke  his collar-bone by the haste he made.\"\\nHe gave himself upentirely to the race, and  ran with his house on his back, which wasall, of course, very praiseworthy; and  therefore he obtained thesecond prize.\"\\n  \"I think I ought to have had some consideration too,\" said theswallow.\"\\n\"I should  imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flightthan I am; and how far I have been!\"\\n far, far away.\"\\n  \"Yes, that is your misfortune,\" said the fence-rail; \"you are sofickle, so unsettled;  you must always be travelling about into foreignlands when the cold commences here.\"\\n You have no love of fatherlandin you.\"\\nThere can be no consideration for you.\"\\n  \"But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor,\" saidthe swallow, \"and  suppose I slept the whole time, would that betaken into account?\"\\n  \"Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,\" said he, \"that youhave slept away half  your time in fatherland; then you will be treatedwith some consideration.\"\\n  \"I deserved the first prize, and not the second,\" said thesnail.\"\\n\"I know so much,  at least, that the hare only ran fromcowardice, and because he thought there was danger  in delay.\"\\nI, on theother hand, made running the business of my life, and have become  acripple in the service.\"\\nIf any one had a first prize, it ought to havebeen myself.\"\\n But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on thecontrary, I despise it.\"\\n And  the snail spat at them with contempt.\"\\n \"I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize- at least,those for which  I voted- was given with just and properconsideration,\" said the old boundary post  in the wood, who was amember of the committee of judges.\"\\n\"I always act with due  order,consideration, and calculation.\"\\nSeven times have I already had thehonor to be  present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote;but to-day is the first time  I have been able to carry out my will.I always reckon the first prize by going through  the alphabet from thebeginning, and the second by going through from the end.\"\\nBe so  kind asto give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon fromthe  beginning.\"\\nThe eighth letter from A is H, and there we have Hfor hare; therefore I  awarded to the hare the first prize.\"\\nTheeighth letter from the end of the alphabet  is S, and therefore thesnail received the second prize.\"\\nNext year, the letter I will  have itsturn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second.\"\\n  \"I should really have voted for myself,\" said the mule, \"if Ihad not been one of the  judges on the committee.\"\\nNot only the rapiditywith which advance is made, but every  other quality should have dueconsideration; as, for instance, how much weight a  candidate is ableto draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor  thesagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which hesuddenly springs  aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track,thinking he has concealed himself.\"\\n No; there is something else onwhich more stress should be laid, and which ought not  be leftunnoticed.\"\\nI mean that which mankind call the beautiful.\"\\nIt is onthe beautiful  that I particularly fix my eyes.\"\\nI observed thewell-grown ears of the hare; it is  a pleasure to me to observe howlong they are.\"\\nIt seemed as if I saw myself again in  the days of mychildhood; and so I voted for the hare.\"\\n  \"Buz,\" said the fly; \"there, I\\'m not going to make a longspeech; but I wish to say  something about hares.\"\\nI have reallyovertaken more than one hare, when I have been  seated on the engine infront of a railway train.\"\\nI often do so.\"\\nOne can then so  easilyjudge of one\\'s own swiftness.\"\\nNot long ago, I crushed the hind legs ofa young  hare.\"\\nHe had been running a long time before the engine;

but I do not want the prize.\"\\n  \"It really seems to me,\" thought the wild rose, though she did notexpress her opinion  aloud- it is not in her nature to do so,- thoughit would have been quite as well if  she had; \"it certainly seems to methat the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of  receiving the firstprize.\"\\nThe sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the  immeasurablepath from the sun to us.\"\\nIt arrives in such strength, that allnature  awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhalefragrance in its presence.\"\\n Our worshipful judges don\\'t appear tohave noticed this at all.\"\\nWere I the sunbeam,  I would give each one ofthem a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and  they are madenough already.\"\\nI only hope,\" continued the rose, \"that peace mayreign  in the wood.\"\\nIt is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and tolive; to live in story  and in song.\"\\nThe sunbeam will outlive us all.\"\\n  \"What is the first prize?\"\\n asked the earthworm, who hadoverslept the time, and only  now came up.\"\\n \"It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,\" replied themule.\"\\n\"I proposed that  as one of the prizes.\"\\nThe hare most decidedlymust have it;

shesat down and made,  as well as she could, a pair of little shoes out ofsome old pieces of red cloth.\"\\nThey  were clumsy, but she meant well,for they were intended for the little girl, whose  name was Karen.\"\\n Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on theday of her mother\\'s  funeral.\"\\nThey were certainly not suitable formourning; but she had no others, and  so she put her bare feet intothem and walked behind the humble coffin.\"\\n Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady;she looked at the  little girl, and taking pity on her, said to theclergyman, \"Look here, if you will  give me the little girl, I willtake care of her.\"\\n  Karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes,but the old lady thought  them hideous, and so they were burnt.\"\\nKarenherself was dressed very neatly and cleanly;  she was taught to readand to sew, and people said that she was pretty.\"\\nBut the mirror  toldher, \"You are more than pretty- you are beautiful.\"\\n  One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the country,and had her little  daughter, who was a princess, with her.\"\\nAll thepeople, amongst them Karen too,  streamed towards the castle, where thelittle princess, in fine white clothes, stood  before the window andallowed herself to be stared at.\"\\nShe wore neither a train nor  a goldencrown, but beautiful red morocco shoes; they were indeed much finerthan those  which the shoemaker\\'s wife had sewn for little Karen.\"\\nThereis really nothing in the  world that can be compared to red shoes!\"\\n Karen was now old enough to be confirmed; she received some newclothes, and she was  also to have some new shoes.\"\\nThe rich shoemakerin the town took the measure of her  little foot in his own room, inwhich there stood great glass cases full of pretty  shoes and whiteslippers.\"\\nIt all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not seevery  well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it.Amongst the shoes stood a  pair of red ones, like those which theprincess had worn.\"\\nHow beautiful they were!\"\\n and the shoemaker saidthat they had been made for a count\\'s daughter, but that they  hadnot fitted her.\"\\n \"I suppose they are of shiny leather?\"\\n asked the old lady.\"\\n\"Theyshine so.\"\\n  \"Yes, they do shine,\" said Karen.\"\\nThey fitted her, and werebought.\"\\nBut the old lady  knew nothing of their being red, for shewould never have allowed Karen to be confirmed  in red shoes, as shewas now to be.\"\\n Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from thechurch door to the  choir it seemed to her as if even the ancientfigures on the monuments, in their stiff  collars and long black robes,had their eyes fixed on her red shoes.\"\\nIt was only of  these that shethought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke ofthe  holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and told her that shewas now to be a grown-up  Christian.\"\\nThe organ pealed forth solemnly,and the sweet children\\'s voices mingled  with that of their old leader;but Karen thought only of her red shoes.\"\\nIn the afternoon  the old ladyheard from everybody that Karen had worn red shoes.\"\\nShe said that itwas  a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and thatKaren was always to go  to church in future in black shoes, even ifthey were old.\"\\n On the following Sunday there was Communion.\"\\nKaren looked first atthe black shoes,  then at the red ones- looked at the red ones again,and put them on.\"\\n The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady wentalong the footpath  through the corn, where it was rather dusty.\"\\n At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on acrutch; he had a  wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and hebowed down to the ground and asked  the old lady whether he mightwipe her shoes.\"\\nThen Karen put out her little foot too.\"\\n \"Dear me, whatpretty dancing-shoes!\"\\n said the soldier.\"\\n\"Sit fast, when you  dance,\"said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.\"\\n The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went withKaren into the church.\"\\n And all the people inside looked at Karen\\'s red shoes, and all thefigures gazed at  them; when Karen knelt before the altar and put thegolden goblet to her mouth, she  thought only of the red shoes.\"\\nItseemed to her as though they were swimming about  in the goblet, andshe forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the \"Lord\\'s Prayer.\"\\n  Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped intoher carriage.\"\\nBut just  as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too,the old soldier said: \"Dear me, what  pretty dancing shoes!\"\\n andKaren could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few  steps; andwhen she had once begun, her legs continued to dance.\"\\nIt seemed asif the  shoes had got power over them.\"\\nShe danced round the churchcorner, for she could not  stop; the coachman had to run after herand seize her.\"\\nHe lifted her into the carriage,  but her feet continuedto dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently.\"\\nAt  last theytook off her shoes, and her legs were at rest.\"\\n At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen couldnot help looking at them.\"\\n Now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would not risefrom her bed again.\"\\n She had to be nursed and waited upon, and this wasno one\\'s duty more than Karen\\'s.\"\\n But there was a grand ball in thetown, and Karen was invited.\"\\nShe looked at the red  shoes, saying toherself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes  on,thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to theball; and  commenced to dance.\"\\n But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to theleft, and when she  wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danceddown the room, down the stairs through  the street, and out through thegates of the town.\"\\nShe danced, and was obliged to dance,  far outinto the dark wood.\"\\nSuddenly something shone up among the trees, andshe  believed it was the moon, for it was a face.\"\\nBut it was the oldsoldier with the red  beard; he sat there nodding his head and said:\"Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!\"\\n  She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; butthey stuck fast.\"\\nShe  tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grownfast to her feet.\"\\nShe danced and was  obliged to go on dancing overfield and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and  by day- but bynight it was most horrible.\"\\n She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead there didnot dance.\"\\nThey had  something better to do than that.\"\\nShe wanted tosit down on the pauper\\'s grave where  the bitter fern grows; but forher there was neither peace nor rest.\"\\nAnd as she danced  past theopen church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, withwings reaching  from his shoulders down to the earth; his face wasstern and grave, and in his hand  he held a broad shining sword.\"\\n \"Dance you shall,\" said he, \"dance in your red shoes till youare pale and cold, till  your skin shrivels up and you are askeleton!\"\\nDance you shall, from door to door, and  where proud andwicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you andfear  you!\"\\nDance you shall, dance- !\"\\n  \"Mercy!\"\\n cried Karen.\"\\nBut she did not hear what the angelanswered, for the shoes  carried her through the gate into thefields, along highways and byways, and  unceasingly she had to dance.\"\\n One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; they weresinging a psalm inside,  and a coffin was being carried out coveredwith flowers.\"\\nThen she knew that she was  forsaken by every one anddamned by the angel of God.\"\\n She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the darknight.\"\\nThe shoes bore  her away over thorns and stumps till she was alltorn and bleeding; she danced away  over the heath to a lonely littlehouse.\"\\nHere, she knew, lived the executioner; and  she tapped withher finger at the window and said:  \"Come out, come out!\"\\nI cannot come in, for I must dance.\"\\n  And the executioner said: \"I don\\'t suppose you know who I am.\"\\nIstrike off the heads  of the wicked, and I notice that my axe istingling to do so.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t cut off my head!\"\\n said Karen, \"for then I could notrepent of my sin.\"\\nBut cut  off my feet with the red shoes.\"\\n  And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck offher feet with the  red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the littlefeet across the field into the  deep forest.\"\\n And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, andtaught her a psalm which  is always sung by sinners; she kissed thehand that guided the axe, and went away over  the heath.\"\\n \"Now, I have suffered enough for the red shoes,\" she said; \"I willgo to church, so  that people can see me.\"\\n And she went quickly up tothe church-door; but when she came  there, the red shoes were dancingbefore her, and she was frightened, and turned back.\"\\n During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears,but when Sunday came  again she said: \"Now I have suffered andstriven enough.\"\\nI believe I am quite as good  as many of those whosit in church and give themselves airs.\"\\n And so she went boldly  on;but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she sawthe red shoes  dancing along before her.\"\\nThen she became terrified, andturned back and repented right  heartily of her sin.\"\\n She went to the parsonage, and begged that she might be taken intoservice there.\"\\nShe  would be industrious, she said, and do everythingthat she could; she did not mind  about the wages as long as she hada roof over her, and was with good people.\"\\nThe  pastor\\'s wife hadpity on her, and took her into service.\"\\nAnd she was industrious  andthoughtful.\"\\nShe sat quiet and listened when the pastor read aloud fromthe Bible  in the evening.\"\\nAll the children liked her very much, butwhen they spoke about dress  and grandeur and beauty she would shakeher head.\"\\n On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was askedwhether she wished  to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, shelooked sadly at her crutches.\"\\nAnd then  the others went to hear God\\'sWord, but she went alone into her little room; this was  only largeenough to hold the bed and a chair.\"\\nHere she sat down with herhymn-book,  and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the windcarried the notes of the organ  over to her from the church, and intears she lifted up her face and said: \"O God!\"\\n help me!\"\\n  Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood anangel of God in white  robes; it was the same one whom she had seenthat night at the church-door.\"\\nHe no longer  carried the sharp sword,but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he  touchedthe ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched itthere shone  a golden star.\"\\nHe touched the walls, which opened wideapart, and she saw the organ  which was pealing forth; she saw thepictures of the old pastors and their wives, and  the congregationsitting in the polished chairs and singing from their hymn-books.The  church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or theroom had gone to  the church.\"\\nShe sat in the pew with the rest of thepastor\\'s household, and when they  had finished the hymn and looked up,they nodded and said, \"It was right of you to  come, Karen.\"\\n  \"It was mercy,\" said she.\"\\n The organ played and the children\\'s voices in the choir soundedsoft and lovely.\"\\nThe  bright warm sunshine streamed through thewindow into the pew where Karen sat, and  her heart became so filledwith it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke.\"\\nHer  soul flew onthe sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked after the RedShoes.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SAUCY BOY  by Hans Christian Andersen  ONCE upon a time there was an old poet, one of those right goodold poets.\"\\n One evening, as he was sitting at home, there was a terrible stormgoing on outside;  the rain was pouring down, but the old poet satcomfortably in his chimney-corner,  where the fire was burning andthe apples were roasting.\"\\n \"There will not be a dry thread left on the poor people who areout in this weather,\"  he said.\"\\n \"Oh, open the door!\"\\nI am so cold and wet through,\" called a littlechild outside.\"\\nIt  was crying and knocking at the door, whilst the rainwas pouring down and the wind  was rattling all the windows.\"\\n \"Poor creature!\"\\n said the poet, and got up and opened the door.Before him stood a  little boy; he was naked, and the water flowed fromhis long fair locks.\"\\nHe was  shivering with cold; if he had not beenlet in, he would certainly have perished in  the storm.\"\\n \"Poor little thing!\"\\n said the poet, and took him by the hand.\"\\nCome to me; I will soon  warm you.\"\\nYou shall have some wine and anapple, for you are such a pretty boy.\"\\n  And he was, too.\"\\nHis eyes sparkled like two bright stars, andalthough the water flowed  down from his fair locks, they stillcurled quite beautifully.\"\\n He looked like a little angel, but was pale with cold, andtrembling all over.\"\\nIn his  hand he held a splendid bow, but it hadbeen entirely spoilt by the rain, and the colours  of the pretty arrowshad run into one another by getting wet.\"\\n The old man sat down by the fire, and taking the little boy on hisknee, wrung the  water out of his locks and warmed his hands in hisown.\"\\n He then made him some hot spiced wine, which quickly revivedhim; so that with reddening  cheeks, he sprang upon the floor anddanced around the old man.\"\\n \"You are a merry boy,\" said the latter.\"\\n\"What is your name?\"\\n  \"My name is Cupid,\" he answered.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you know me?\"\\nThere lies mybow.\"\\nI shoot with  that, you know.\"\\nLook, the weather is getting fineagain- the moon is shining.\"\\n  \"But your bow is spoilt,\" said the old poet.\"\\n \"That would be unfortunate,\" said the little boy, taking it up andlooking at it.\"\\n\"Oh,  it\\'s quite dry and isn\\'t damaged at all.\"\\nThestring is quite tight; I\\'ll try it.\"\\n So,  drawing it back, he took anarrow, aimed, and shot the good old poet right in the heart.\"\\n \"Do yousee now that my bow was not spoilt?\"\\n he said, and, loudly laughing,ran away.\"\\n What a naughty boy to shoot the old poet like that, whohad taken him into his warm  room, had been so good to him, and hadgiven him the nicest wine and the best apple!\"\\n The good old man lay upon the floor crying; he was really shotin the heart.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n  he cried, \"what a naughty boy this Cupid is!\"\\nIshall tell all the good children about  this, so that they take carenever to play with him, lest he hurt them.\"\\n  And all good children, both girls and boys, whom he told aboutthis, were on their  guard against wicked Cupid; but he deceives themall the same, for he is very deep.\"\\n When the students come out ofclass, he walks beside them with a book under his arm,  and wearing ablack coat.\"\\nThey cannot recognize him.\"\\nAnd then, if they take him bythe  arm, believing him to be a student too, he sticks an arrow intotheir chest.\"\\nAnd when  the girls go to church to be confirmed, he isamongst them too.\"\\nIn fact, he is always  after people.\"\\nHe sits in thelarge chandelier in the theatre and blazes away, so that  peoplethink it is a lamp; but they soon find out their mistake.\"\\nHe walksabout in the  castle garden and on the promenades.\"\\nYes, once he shotyour father and your mother  in the heart too.\"\\nJust ask them, and youwill hear what they say.\"\\nOh!\"\\nhe is a bad boy,  this Cupid, and you mustnever have anything to do with him, for he is after every  one.\"\\nJustthink, he even shot an arrow at old grandmother; but that was a longtime  ago.\"\\nThe wound has long been healed, but such things are neverforgotten.\"\\n Now you know what a bad boy this wicked Cupid is.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SHADOW  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN very hot climates, where the heat of the sun has great power,people are usually  as brown as mahogany; and in the hottestcountries they are negroes, with black skins.\"\\n A learned man oncetravelled into one of these warm climates, from the cold regions  ofthe north, and thought he would roam about as he did at home; but hesoon had to  change his opinion.\"\\nHe found that, like all sensiblepeople, he must remain in the  house during the whole day, with everywindow and door closed, so that it looked as  if all in the housewere asleep or absent.\"\\nThe houses of the narrow street in which  helived were so lofty that the sun shone upon them from morning tillevening, and it  became quite unbearable.\"\\nThis learned man from thecold regions was young as well as  clever; but it seemed to him as ifhe were sitting in an oven, and he became quite  exhausted and weak,and grew so thin that his shadow shrivelled up, and became  muchsmaller than it had been at home.\"\\nThe sun took away even what was leftof it, and  he saw nothing of it till the evening, after sunset.\"\\nIt wasreally a pleasure, as soon  as the lights were brought into the room,to see the shadow stretch itself against  the wall, even to theceiling, so tall was it; and it really wanted a good stretch  torecover its strength.\"\\nThe learned man would sometimes go out intothe balcony to  stretch himself also; and as soon as the stars cameforth in the clear, beautiful sky,  he felt revived.\"\\nPeople at thishour began to make their appearance in all the balconies  in thestreet; for in warm climates every window has a balcony, in which theycan breathe  the fresh evening air, which is very necessary, even tothose who are used to a heat  that makes them as brown as mahogany;so that the street presented a very lively  appearance.\"\\nHere wereshoemakers, and tailors, and all sorts of people sitting.\"\\nIn  thestreet beneath, they brought out tables and chairs, lighted candles byhundreds,  talked and sang, and were very merry.\"\\nThere were peoplewalking, carriages driving,  and mules trotting along, with their bellson the harness, \"tingle, tingle,\" as they  went.\"\\nThen the dead werecarried to the grave with the sound of solemn music, and the  tollingof the church bells.\"\\nIt was indeed a scene of varied life in thestreet.\"\\nOne  house only, which was just opposite to the one in whichthe foreign learned man lived,  formed a contrast to all this, for itwas quite still; and yet somebody dwelt there,  for flowers stood inthe balcony, blooming beautifully in the hot sun; and this could  nothave been unless they had been watered carefully.\"\\nTherefore some onemust be in  the house to do this.\"\\nThe doors leading to the balcony werehalf opened in the evening;  and although in the front room all wasdark, music could be heard from the interior  of the house.\"\\nThe foreignlearned man considered this music very delightful; but  perhaps hefancied it; for everything in these warm countries pleased him,excepting  the heat of the sun.\"\\nThe foreign landlord said he did notknow who had taken the opposite  house- nobody was to be seen there;and as to the music, he thought it seemed very  tedious, to him mostuncommonly so.\"\\n \"It is just as if some one was practising a piece that he couldnot manage; it is always  the same piece.\"\\nHe thinks, I suppose, that hewill be able to manage it at last; but  I do not think so, however longhe may play it.\"\\n  Once the foreigner woke in the night.\"\\nHe slept with the dooropen which led to the  balcony; the wind had raised the curtainbefore it, and there appeared a wonderful  brightness over all in thebalcony of the opposite house.\"\\nThe flowers seemed like  flames of themost gorgeous colors, and among the flowers stood a beautifulslender  maiden.\"\\nIt was to him as if light streamed from her, anddazzled his eyes; but then  he had only just opened them, as he awokefrom his sleep.\"\\nWith one spring he was out  of bed, and crept softlybehind the curtain.\"\\nBut she was gone- the brightness  haddisappeared; the flowers no longer appeared like flames, althoughstill as  beautiful as ever.\"\\nThe door stood ajar, and from an innerroom sounded music so sweet  and so lovely, that it produced the mostenchanting thoughts, and acted on the senses  with magic power.\"\\nWhocould live there?\"\\nWhere was the real entrance?\"\\nfor, both in the  streetand in the lane at the side, the whole ground floor was a continuationof shops;  and people could not always be passing through them.\"\\n One evening the foreigner sat in the balcony.\"\\nA light wasburning in his own room,  just behind him.\"\\nIt was quite natural,therefore, that his shadow should fall on the  wall of the oppositehouse; so that, as he sat amongst the flowers on his balcony,  whenhe moved, his shadow moved also.\"\\n \"I think my shadow is the only living thing to be seenopposite,\" said the learned  man; \"see how pleasantly it sits among theflowers.\"\\nThe door is only ajar; the shadow  ought to be clever enoughto step in and look about him, and then to come back and  tell mewhat he has seen.\"\\nYou could make yourself useful in this way,\" saidhe, jokingly;  \"be so good as to step in now, will you?\"\\n and then henodded to the shadow, and the  shadow nodded in return.\"\\n\"Now go, butdon\\'t stay away altogether.\"\\n  Then the foreigner stood up, and the shadow on the oppositebalcony stood up also;  the foreigner turned round, the shadowturned; and if any one had observed, they might  have seen it gostraight into the half-opened door of the opposite balcony, as  thelearned man re-entered his own room, and let the curtain fall.\"\\nThenext morning  he went out to take his coffee and read the newspapers.\"\\n \"How is this?\"\\n he exclaimed, as he stood in the sunshine.\"\\n\"Ihave lost my shadow.\"\\nSo  it really did go away yesterday evening, andit has not returned.\"\\nThis is very  annoying.\"\\n  And it certainly did vex him, not so much because the shadow wasgone, but because  he knew there was a story of a man without a shadow.All the people at home, in his  country, knew this story; and when hereturned, and related his own adventures, they  would say it was onlyan imitation; and he had no desire for such things to be said  ofhim.\"\\nSo he decided not to speak of it at all, which was a verysensible determination.\"\\n In the evening he went out again on his balcony, taking care toplace the light behind  him; for he knew that a shadow always wants hismaster for a screen; but he could not  entice him out.\"\\nHe madehimself little, and he made himself tall; but there was no  shadow, andno shadow came.\"\\nHe said, \"Hem, a-hem;\" but it was all useless.\"\\nThatwas  very vexatious; but in warm countries everything grows veryquickly; and, after a week  had passed, he saw, to his great joy,that a new shadow was growing from his feet,  when he walked in thesunshine; so that the root must have remained.\"\\nAfter three weeks,  hehad quite a respectable shadow, which, during his return journey tonorthern lands,  continued to grow, and became at last so large that hemight very well have spared  half of it.\"\\nWhen this learned manarrived at home, he wrote books about the true, the  good, and thebeautiful, which are to be found in this world; and so days andyears  passed- many, many years.\"\\n One evening, as he sat in his study, a very gentle tap was heardat the door.\"\\n\"Come  in,\" said he; but no one came.\"\\nHe opened thedoor, and there stood before him a man  so remarkably thin that he feltseriously troubled at his appearance.\"\\nHe was, however,  very welldressed, and looked like a gentleman.\"\\n\"To whom have I the honor ofspeaking?\"\\n  said he.\"\\n \"Ah, I hoped you would recognize me,\" said the elegant stranger;\"I have gained so  much that I have a body of flesh, and clothes towear.\"\\nYou never expected to see me  in such a condition.\"\\nDo you notrecognize your old shadow?\"\\nAh, you never expected that  I should returnto you again.\"\\nAll has been prosperous with me since I was with youlast;  I have become rich in every way, and, were I inclined topurchase my freedom from  service, I could easily do so.\"\\n And as hespoke he rattled between his fingers a number  of costly trinkets whichhung to a thick gold watch-chain he wore round his neck.\"\\n Diamond ringssparkled on his fingers, and it was all real.\"\\n \"I cannot recover from my astonishment,\" said the learned man.\"\\nWhat does all this  mean?\"\\n  \"Something rather unusual,\" said the shadow; \"but you are yourselfan uncommon man,  and you know very well that I have followed in yourfootsteps ever since your childhood.\"\\n As soon as you found that Ihave travelled enough to be trusted alone, I went my own  way, and I amnow in the most brilliant circumstances.\"\\nBut I felt a kind oflonging  to see you once more before you die, and I wanted to seethis place again, for there  is always a clinging to the land ofone\\'s birth.\"\\nI know that you have now another shadow;  do I owe youanything?\"\\nIf so, have the goodness to say what it is.\"\\n  \"No!\"\\nIs it really you?\"\\n said the learned man.\"\\n\"Well, this ismost remarkable; I never  supposed it possible that a man\\'s oldshadow could become a human being.\"\\n  \"Just tell me what I owe you,\" said the shadow, \"for I do not liketo be in debt to  any man.\"\\n  \"How can you talk in that manner?\"\\n said the learned man.\"\\n\"Whatquestion of debt can  there be between us?\"\\nYou are as free as anyone.\"\\nI rejoice exceedingly to hear of your  good fortune.\"\\nSit down, oldfriend, and tell me a little of how it happened, and what  you saw inthe house opposite to me while we were in those hot climates.\"\\n  \"Yes, I will tell you all about it,\" said the shadow, sittingdown; \"but then you must  promise me never to tell in this city,wherever you may meet me, that I have been your  shadow.\"\\nI amthinking of being married, for I have more than sufficient tosupport a  family.\"\\n  \"Make yourself quite easy,\" said the learned man; \"I will tellno one who you really  are.\"\\nHere is my hand,- I promise, and a wordis sufficient between man and man.\"\\n  \"Between man and a shadow,\" said the shadow; for he could not helpsaying so.\"\\n It was really most remarkable how very much he had become a man inappearance.\"\\nHe was  dressed in a suit of the very finest black cloth,polished boots, and an opera crush  hat, which could be folded togetherso that nothing could be seen but the crown and  the rim, besides thetrinkets, the gold chain, and the diamond rings already spoken  of.\"\\nTheshadow was, in fact, very well dressed, and this made a man of him.\"\\nNow I will  relate to you what you wish to know,\" said the shadow,placing his foot with the  polished leather boot as firmly aspossible on the arm of the new shadow of the learned  man, which lay athis feet like a poodle dog.\"\\nThis was done, it might be from pride,or  perhaps that the new shadow might cling to him, but the prostrateshadow remained quite  quiet and at rest, in order that it mightlisten, for it wanted to know how a shadow  could be sent away by itsmaster, and become a man itself.\"\\n\"Do you know,\" said the  shadow, \"thatin the house opposite to you lived the most glorious creature in theworld?\"\\n It was poetry.\"\\nI remained there three weeks, and it was morelike three thousand years,  for I read all that has ever been writtenin poetry or prose; and I may say, in truth,  that I saw and learnteverything.\"\\n  \"Poetry!\"\\n exclaimed the learned man.\"\\n\"Yes, she lives as a hermitin great cities.\"\\n Poetry!\"\\nWell, I saw her once for a very short moment,while sleep weighed down my  eyelids.\"\\nShe flashed upon me from thebalcony like the radiant aurora borealis,  surrounded with flowers likeflames of fire.\"\\nTell me, you were on the balcony that  evening; youwent through the door, and what did you see?\"\\n  \"I found myself in an ante-room,\" said the shadow.\"\\n\"You stillsat opposite to me,  looking into the room.\"\\nThere was no light, or atleast it seemed in partial darkness,  for the door of a whole suiteof rooms stood open, and they were brilliantly lighted.\"\\n The blaze oflight would have killed me, had I approached too near the maidenmyself,  but I was cautious, and took time, which is what every oneought to do.\"\\n  \"And what didst thou see?\"\\n asked the learned man.\"\\n \"I saw everything, as you shall hear.\"\\nBut- it really is notpride on my part, as a  free man and possessing the knowledge that Ido, besides my position, not to speak  of my wealth- I wish you wouldsay you to me instead of thou.\"\\n  \"I beg your pardon,\" said the learned man; \"it is an old habit,which it is difficult  to break.\"\\nYou are quite right; I will try tothink of it.\"\\nBut now tell me everything  that you saw.\"\\n  \"Everything,\" said the shadow; \"for I saw and know everything.\"\\n  \"What was the appearance of the inner rooms?\"\\n asked the scholar.\"\\nWas it there like  a cool grove, or like a holy temple?\"\\nWere thechambers like a starry sky seen from  the top of a high mountain?\"\\n  \"It was all that you describe,\" said the shadow; \"but I did not goquite in- I remained  in the twilight of the ante-room- but I was ina very good position,- I could see and  hear all that was going on inthe court of poetry.\"\\n  \"But what did you see?\"\\nDid the gods of ancient times passthrough the rooms?\"\\nDid old  heroes fight their battles over again?\"\\nWerethere lovely children at play, who related  their dreams?\"\\n  \"I tell you I have been there, and therefore you may be surethat I saw everything  that was to be seen.\"\\nIf you had gone there,you would not have remained a human being,  whereas I became one; andat the same moment I became aware of my inner being, my  inbornaffinity to the nature of poetry.\"\\nIt is true I did not think muchabout it while  I was with you, but you will remember that I was alwaysmuch larger at sunrise and  sunset, and in the moonlight even morevisible than yourself, but I did not then  understand my innerexistence.\"\\nIn the ante-room it was revealed to me.\"\\nI became a man;  Icame out in full maturity.\"\\nBut you had left the warm countries.\"\\nAs aman, I felt ashamed  to go about without boots or clothes, and thatexterior finish by which man is known.\"\\n So I went my own way; I cantell you, for you will not put it in a book.\"\\nI hid myself  under thecloak of a cake woman, but she little thought who she concealed.\"\\nItwas not  till evening that I ventured out.\"\\nI ran about the streets inthe moonlight.\"\\nI drew  myself up to my full height upon the walls,which tickled my back very pleasantly.\"\\n I ran here and there, lookedthrough the highest windows into the rooms, and over the  roofs.\"\\nIlooked in, and saw what nobody else could see, or indeed ought to see;in fact,  it is a bad world, and I would not care to be a man, but thatmen are of some importance.\"\\n I saw the most miserable things going onbetween husbands and wives, parents and  children,- sweet, incomparablechildren.\"\\nI have seen what no human being has the power  of knowing,although they would all be very glad to know- the evil conduct oftheir  neighbors.\"\\nHad I written a newspaper, how eagerly it wouldhave been read!\"\\nInstead  of which, I wrote directly to the personsthemselves, and great alarm arose in all  the town I visited.\"\\nTheyhad so much fear of me, and yet how dearly they loved me.\"\\n Theprofessor made me a professor.\"\\nThe tailor gave me new clothes; I amwell provided  for in that way.\"\\nThe overseer of the mint struck coinsfor me.\"\\nThe women declared that  I was handsome, and so I became theman you now see me.\"\\nAnd now I must say adieu.\"\\nHere  is my card.\"\\nIlive on the sunny side of the street, and always stay at home in  rainyweather.\"\\n And the shadow departed.\"\\n \"This is all very remarkable,\" said the learned man.\"\\n Years passed, days and years went by, and the shadow came again.\"\\nHow are you going  on now?\"\\n he asked.\"\\n \"Ah!\"\\n said the learned man; \"I am writing about the true, thebeautiful, and the good;  but no one cares to hear anything about it.\"\\nIam quite in despair, for I take it to  heart very much.\"\\n  \"That is what I never do,\" said the shadow; \"I am growing quitefat and stout, which  every one ought to be.\"\\nYou do not understandthe world; you will make yourself ill  about it; you ought to travel; Iam going on a journey in the summer, will you go with  me?\"\\nI shouldlike a travelling companion; will you travel with me as my shadow?It would  give me great pleasure, and I will pay all expenses.\"\\n  \"Are you going to travel far?\"\\n asked the learned man.\"\\n \"That is a matter of opinion,\" replied the shadow.\"\\n\"At all events,a journey will do  you good, and if you will be my shadow, then allyour journey shall be paid.\"\\n  \"It appears to me very absurd,\" said the learned man.\"\\n \"But it is the way of the world,\" replied the shadow, \"andalways will be.\"\\n Then he  went away.\"\\n Everything went wrong with the learned man.\"\\nSorrow and troublepursued him, and what  he said about the good, the beautiful, and thetrue, was of as much value to most people  as a nutmeg would be to acow.\"\\nAt length he fell ill.\"\\n\"You really look like a shadow,\"  peoplesaid to him, and then a cold shudder would pass over him, for he hadhis own  thoughts on the subject.\"\\n \"You really ought to go to some watering-place,\" said the shadowon his next visit.\"\\n \"There is no other chance for you.\"\\nI will takeyou with me, for the sake of old  acquaintance.\"\\nI will pay the expensesof your journey, and you shall write a  description of it to amuse usby the way.\"\\nI should like to go to a watering-place;  my beard does notgrow as it ought, which is from weakness, and I must have a beard.\"\\n Nowdo be sensible and accept my proposal; we shall travel as intimatefriends.\"\\n  And at last they started together.\"\\nThe shadow was master now,and the master became  the shadow.\"\\nThey drove together, and rode andwalked in company with each other, side  by side, or one in front andthe other behind, according to the position of the sun.\"\\n The shadowalways knew when to take the place of honor, but the learned mantook no  notice of it, for he had a good heart, and was exceedinglymild and friendly.\"\\n One day the master said to the shadow, \"We have grown uptogether from our childhood,  and now that we have become travellingcompanions, shall we not drink to our good  fellowship, and say theeand thou to each other?\"\\n  \"What you say is very straightforward and kindly meant,\" saidthe shadow, who was now  really master.\"\\n\"I will be equally kind andstraightforward.\"\\nYou are a learned man,  and know how wonderful humannature is.\"\\nThere are some men who cannot endure the smell  of brownpaper; it makes them ill.\"\\nOthers will feel a shuddering sensation totheir  very marrow, if a nail is scratched on a pane of glass.\"\\nI myselfhave a similar kind  of feeling when I hear any one say thou to me.\"\\nIfeel crushed by it, as I used to feel  in my former position withyou.\"\\nYou will perceive that this is a matter of feeling,  not pride.I cannot allow you to say thou to me; I will gladly say it to you,  andtherefore your wish will be half fulfilled.\"\\n Then the shadow addressedhis former  master as thou.\"\\n \"It is going rather too far,\" said the latter, \"that I am to sayyou when I speak to  him, and he is to say thou to me.\"\\n However, he wasobliged to submit.\"\\n They arrived at length at the baths, where there were manystrangers, and among them  a beautiful princess, whose real diseaseconsisted in being too sharp-sighted, which  made every one veryuneasy.\"\\nShe saw at once that the new comer was very different to  everyone else.\"\\n\"They say he is here to make his beard grow,\" she thought;\"but I know  the real cause, he is unable to cast a shadow.\"\\n Then shebecame very curious on the  matter, and one day, while on thepromenade, she entered into conversation with the  strange gentleman.Being a princess, she was not obliged to stand upon much ceremony,so  she said to him without hesitation, \"Your illness consists in notbeing able to cast  a shadow.\"\\n  \"Your royal highness must be on the high road to recovery fromyour illness,\" said  he.\"\\n\"I know your complaint arose from being toosharp-sighted, and in this case it  has entirely failed.\"\\nI happen tohave a most unusual shadow.\"\\nHave you not seen a person  who is alwaysat my side?\"\\nPersons often give their servants finer cloth for  theirliveries than for their own clothes, and so I have dressed out myshadow like  a man; nay, you may observe that I have even given him ashadow of his own; it is rather  expensive, but I like to have thingsabout me that are peculiar.\"\\n  \"How is this?\"\\n thought the princess; \"am I really cured?\"\\nThis mustbe the best  watering-place in existence.\"\\nWater in our times hascertainly wonderful power.\"\\nBut  I will not leave this place yet, justas it begins to be amusing.\"\\nThis foreign prince\\ufffefor he must be aprince- pleases me above all things.\"\\nI only hope his beard won\\'t grow,or  he will leave at once.\"\\n  In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in thelarge assembly rooms.\"\\n She was light, but he was lighter still; she hadnever seen such a dancer before.\"\\nShe  told him from what country shehad come, and found he knew it and had been there, but  not while shewas at home.\"\\nHe had looked into the windows of her father\\'s palace,both  the upper and the lower windows; he had seen many things, andcould therefore answer  the princess, and make allusions which quiteastonished her.\"\\nShe thought he must be  the cleverest man in all theworld, and felt the greatest respect for his knowledge.\"\\n When shedanced with him again she fell in love with him, which the shadowquickly  discovered, for she had with her eyes looked him through andthrough.\"\\nThey danced once  more, and she was nearly telling him, butshe had some discretion; she thought of her  country, her kingdom,and the number of people over whom she would one day have to  rule.\"\\n\"Heis a clever man,\" she thought to herself, \"which is a good thing,and he dances  admirably, which is also good.\"\\nBut has hewell-grounded knowledge?\"\\nthat is an important  question, and I must tryhim.\"\\n Then she asked him a most difficult question, she  herselfcould not have answered it, and the shadow made a most unaccountablegrimace.\"\\n \"You cannot answer that,\" said the princess.\"\\n \"I learnt something about it in my childhood,\" he replied; \"andbelieve that even my  very shadow, standing over there by the door,could answer it.\"\\n  \"Your shadow,\" said the princess; \"indeed that would be veryremarkable.\"\\n  \"I do not say so positively,\" observed the shadow; \"but I aminclined to believe that  he can do so.\"\\nHe has followed me for somany years, and has heard so much from me,  that I think it is verylikely.\"\\nBut your royal highness must allow me to observe, that  he isvery proud of being considered a man, and to put him in a goodhumor, so that  he may answer correctly, he must be treated as a man.\"\\n  \"I shall be very pleased to do so,\" said the princess.\"\\nSo shewalked up to the learned  man, who stood in the doorway, and spoke tohim of the sun, and the moon, of the green  forests, and of people nearhome and far off; and the learned man conversed with her  pleasantlyand sensibly.\"\\n \"What a wonderful man he must be, to have such a clever shadow!\"\\nthought she.\"\\n\"If I  were to choose him it would be a real blessing tomy country and my subjects, and I  will do it.\"\\n So the princess and theshadow were soon engaged to each other, but no  one was to be told aword about it, till she returned to her kingdom.\"\\n \"No one shall know,\" said the shadow; \"not even my own shadow;\"and he had very  particular reasons for saying so.\"\\n After a time, the princess returned to the land over which shereigned, and the shadow  accompanied her.\"\\n \"Listen my friend,\" said the shadow to the learned man; \"nowthat I am as fortunate  and as powerful as any man can be, I will dosomething unusually good for you.\"\\nYou  shall live in my palace, drivewith me in the royal carriage, and have a hundred  thousand dollars ayear; but you must allow every one to call you a shadow, and  neverventure to say that you have been a man.\"\\nAnd once a year, when I sitin my balcony  in the sunshine, you must lie at my feet as becomes ashadow to do; for I must tell  you I am going to marry the princess,and our wedding will take place this evening.\"\\n  \"Now, really, this is too ridiculous,\" said the learned man.\"\\n\"Icannot, and will not,  submit to such folly.\"\\nIt would be cheating thewhole country, and the princess also.\"\\n I will disclose everything,and say that I am the man, and that you are only a shadow  dressed upin men\\'s clothes.\"\\n  \"No one would believe you,\" said the shadow; \"be reasonable,now, or I will call the  guards.\"\\n  \"I will go straight to the princess,\" said the learned man.\"\\n \"But I shall be there first,\" replied the shadow, \"and you will besent to prison.\"\\n  And so it turned out, for the guards readily obeyedhim, as they knew he was going  to marry the king\\'s daughter.\"\\n \"You tremble,\" said the princess, when the shadow appearedbefore her.\"\\n\"Has anything  happened?\"\\nYou must not be ill to-day, forthis evening our wedding will take place.\"\\n  \"I have gone through the most terrible affair that couldpossibly happen,\" said the  shadow; \"only imagine, my shadow has gonemad; I suppose such a poor, shallow brain,  could not bear much; hefancies that he has become a real man, and that I am his shadow.\"\\n  \"How very terrible,\" cried the princess; \"is he locked up?\"\\n  \"Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never recover.\"\\n  \"Poor shadow!\"\\n said the princess; \"it is very unfortunate for him;it would really  be a good deed to free him from his frail existence;and, indeed, when I think how  often people take the part of thelower class against the higher, in these days, it  would be policy toput him out of the way quietly.\"\\n  \"It is certainly rather hard upon him, for he was a faithfulservant,\" said the shadow;  and he pretended to sigh.\"\\n \"Yours is a noble character,\" said the princess, and bowed herselfbefore him.\"\\n In the evening the whole town was illuminated, and cannons fired\"boom,\" and the  soldiers presented arms.\"\\nIt was indeed a grandwedding.\"\\nThe princess and the shadow  stepped out on the balcony toshow themselves, and to receive one cheer more.\"\\nBut the  learned manheard nothing of all these festivities, for he had already beenexecuted.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SHEPHERDESS AND THE SHEEP  by Hans Christian Andersen  HAVE you ever seen an old wooden cupboard quite black with age,and ornamented with  carved foliage and curious figures?\"\\nWell, justsuch a cupboard stood in a parlor, and  had been left to the familyas a legacy by the great-grandmother.\"\\nIt was covered from  top tobottom with carved roses and tulips; the most curious scrolls weredrawn upon  it, and out of them peeped little stags\\' heads, withantlers.\"\\nIn the middle of the  cupboard door was the carved figure of aman most ridiculous to look at.\"\\nHe grinned  at you, for no one couldcall it laughing.\"\\nHe had goat\\'s legs, little horns on his  head, anda long beard; the children in the room always called him,  \"Majorgeneral-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\\'s-legs.\"\\n It wascertainly a very  difficult name to pronounce, and there are very fewwho ever receive such a title,  but then it seemed wonderful how hecame to be carved at all; yet there he was, always  looking at thetable under the looking-glass, where stood a very pretty  littleshepherdess made of china.\"\\nHer shoes were gilt, and her dress had ared rose  or an ornament.\"\\nShe wore a hat, and carried a crook, thatwere both gilded, and looked  very bright and pretty.\"\\nClose by her sidestood a little chimney-sweep, as black as  coal, and also made ofchina.\"\\nHe was, however, quite as clean and neat as any other  chinafigure; he only represented a black chimney-sweep, and the chinaworkers might  just as well have made him a prince, had they feltinclined to do so.\"\\nHe stood holding  his ladder quite handily, andhis face was as fair and rosy as a girl\\'s; indeed, that  was rather amistake, it should have had some black marks on it.\"\\nHe and theshepherdess  had been placed close together, side by side; and, beingso placed, they became engaged  to each other, for they were verywell suited, being both made of the same sort of  china, and beingequally fragile.\"\\nClose to them stood another figure, three times  aslarge as they were, and also made of china.\"\\nHe was an old Chinaman,who could nod  his head, and used to pretend that he was thegrandfather of the shepherdess, although  he could not prove it.\"\\nHehowever assumed authority over her, and therefore  when\"Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\\'s-legs\" asked forthe little  shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head to show thathe consented.\"\\n\"You will  have a husband,\" said the old Chinaman to her,\"who I really believe is made of mahogany.\"\\n He will make you a ladyof Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\\'s-legs.\"\\n He hasthe whole cupboard full of silver plate, which he keeps locked up insecret  drawers.\"\\n  \"I won\\'t go into the dark cupboard,\" said the littleshepherdess.\"\\n\"I have heard that  he has eleven china wives therealready.\"\\n  \"Then you shall be the twelfth,\" said the old Chinaman.\"\\nTo-night as soon as you hear  a rattling in the old cupboard, youshall be married, as true as I am a Chinaman;\"  and then he noddedhis head and fell asleep.\"\\n Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart,the china  chimney-sweep.\"\\n\"I must entreat you,\" said she, \"to go outwith me into the wide world,  for we cannot stay here.\"\\n  \"I will do whatever you wish,\" said the little chimney-sweep; \"letus go immediately:  I think I shall be able to maintain you with myprofession.\"\\n  \"If we were but safely down from the table!\"\\n said she; \"I shallnot be happy till we  are really out in the world.\"\\n  Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her little footon the carved edge  and gilt-leaf ornaments of the table.\"\\nHe broughthis little ladder to help her, and  so they contrived to reach thefloor.\"\\nBut when they looked at the old cupboard, they  saw it was allin an uproar.\"\\nThe carved stags pushed out their heads, raised  theirantlers, and twisted their necks.\"\\nThe major-general sprung up in theair; and  cried out to the old Chinaman, \"They are running away!\"\\ntheyare running away!\"\\n The  two were rather frightened at this, so theyjumped into the drawer of the window-seat.\"\\n Here were three or fourpacks of cards not quite complete, and a doll\\'s theatre, which  hadbeen built up very neatly.\"\\nA comedy was being performed in it, and allthe queens  of diamonds, clubs, and hearts,, and spades, sat in thefirst row fanning themselves  with tulips, and behind them stood allthe knaves, showing that they had heads above  and below as playingcards generally have.\"\\nThe play was about two lovers, who were  notallowed to marry, and the shepherdess wept because it was so likeher own story.\"\\n \"I cannot bear it,\" said she, \"I must get out of thedrawer;\" but when they reached  the floor, and cast their eyes on thetable, there was the old Chinaman awake and  shaking his whole body,till all at once down he came on the floor, \"plump.\"\\n \"The old  Chinamanis coming,\" cried the little shepherdess in a fright, and down shefell on  one knee.\"\\n \"I have thought of something,\" said the chimney-sweep; \"let us getinto the great  pot-pourri jar which stands in the corner; there we canlie on rose-leaves and lavender,  and throw salt in his eyes if hecomes near us.\"\\n  \"No, that will never do,\" said she, \"because I know that theChinaman and the pot-pourri  jar were lovers once, and there alwaysremains behind a feeling of good-will between  those who have been sointimate as that.\"\\nNo, there is nothing left for us but to go  outinto the wide world.\"\\n  \"Have you really courage enough to go out into the wide world withme?\"\\n said the  chimney-sweep; \"have you thought how large it is, andthat we can never come back here  again?\"\\n  \"Yes, I have,\" she replied.\"\\n When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he said, \"Myway is through the  stove and up the chimney.\"\\nHave you courage to creepwith me through the fire-box, and  the iron pipe?\"\\nWhen we get to thechimney I shall know how to manage very well.\"\\nWe  shall soon climbtoo high for any one to reach us, and we shall come through a holein  the top out into the wide world.\"\\n So he led her to the door ofthe stove.\"\\n \"It looks very dark,\" said she; still she went in with him throughthe stove and through  the pipe, where it was as dark as pitch.\"\\n \"Now we are in the chimney,\" said he; \"and look, there is abeautiful star shining  above it.\"\\n It was a real star shining down uponthem as if it would show them the way.\"\\n So they clambered, and crepton, and a frightful steep place it was; but the  chimney-sweep helpedher and supported her, till they got higher and higher.\"\\nHe  showedher the best places on which to set her little china foot, so atlast they reached  the top of the chimney, and sat themselves down, forthey were very tired, as may be  supposed.\"\\nThe sky, with all its stars,was over their heads, and below were the roofs  of the town.\"\\nThey couldsee for a very long distance out into the wide world, and the  poorlittle shepherdess leaned her head on her chimney-sweep\\'s shoulder,and wept till  she washed the gilt off her sash; the world was sodifferent to what she expected.\"\\n \"This is too much,\" she said; \"Icannot bear it, the world is too large.\"\\nOh, I wish  I were safe back onthe table.\"\\nagain, under the looking glass; I shall never be happy  tillI am safe back again.\"\\nNow I have followed you out into the wide world,you will  take me back, if you love me.\"\\n  Then the chimney-sweep tried to reason with her, and spoke ofthe old Chinaman, and  of the Major-general-field-sergeant-commanderBilly-goat\\'s legs; but she sobbed so  bitterly, and kissed her littlechimney-sweep till he was obliged to do all she asked,  foolish as itwas.\"\\nAnd so, with a great deal of trouble, they climbed down thechimney,  and then crept through the pipe and stove, which werecertainly not very pleasant  places.\"\\nThen they stood in the darkfire-box, and listened behind the door, to hear  what was going on inthe room.\"\\nAs it was all quiet, they peeped out.\"\\nAlas!\"\\nthere lay  theold Chinaman on the floor; he had fallen down from the table as heattempted to  run after them, and was broken into three pieces; hisback had separated entirely,  and his head had rolled into a cornerof the room.\"\\nThe major-general stood in his old  place, and appearedlost in thought.\"\\n \"This is terrible,\" said the little shepherdess.\"\\n\"My poor oldgrandfather is broken  to pieces, and it is our fault.\"\\nI shall neverlive after this;\" and she wrung her little  hands.\"\\n \"He can be riveted,\" said the chimney-sweep; \"he can be riveted.Do not be so hasty.\"\\n If they cement his back, and put a good rivet init, he will be as good as new, and  be able to say as many disagreeablethings to us as ever.\"\\n  \"Do you think so?\"\\n said she; and then they climbed up to thetable, and stood in their  old places.\"\\n \"As we have done no good,\" said the chimney-sweep, \"we might aswell have remained  here, instead of taking so much trouble.\"\\n  \"I wish grandfather was riveted,\" said the shepherdess.\"\\n\"Will itcost much, I wonder?\"\\n  And she had her wish.\"\\nThe family had the Chinaman\\'s back mended,and a strong rivet  put through his neck; he looked as good as new, buthe could no longer nod his head.\"\\n \"You have become proud since your fall broke you to pieces,\"said  Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\\'s-legs.\"\\n\"Youhave no reason to  give yourself such airs.\"\\nAm I to have her or not?\"\\n  The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked piteously atthe old Chinaman,  for they were afraid he might nod; but he was notable: besides, it was so tiresome  to be always telling strangers hehad a rivet in the back of his neck.\"\\n And so the little china people remained together, and were glad ofthe grandfather\\'s  rivet, and continued to love each other till theywere broken to pieces.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  THE SHEPHERD\\'S STORY OF THE BOND OF FRIENDSHIP  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE little dwelling in which we lived was of clay, but thedoor-posts were columns  of fluted marble, found near the spot on whichit stood.\"\\nThe roof sloped nearly to  the ground.\"\\nIt was at this timedark, brown, and ugly, but had originally been formed  of bloomingolive and laurel branches, brought from beyond the mountains.\"\\nThehouse  was situated in a narrow gorge, whose rocky walls rose to aperpendicular height, naked  and black, while round their summitsclouds often hung, looking like white living  figures.\"\\nNot a singingbird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to the sound  of thepipe.\"\\nThe spot was one sacred to olden times; even its name recalled amemory  of the days when it was called \"Delphi.\"\\n Then the summits ofthe dark, sacred mountains  were covered with snow, and the highest,mount Parnassus, glowed longest in the red  evening light.\"\\nThe brookwhich rolled from it near our house, was also sacred.\"\\nHow  well I canremember every spot in that deep, sacred solitude!\"\\nA fire had beenkindled  in the midst of the hut, and while the hot ashes lay there redand glowing, the bread  was baked in them.\"\\nAt times the snow would bepiled so high around our hut as almost  to hide it, and then mymother appeared most cheerful.\"\\nShe would hold my head between  herhands, and sing the songs she never sang at other times, for theTurks, our masters,  would not allow it.\"\\nShe sang,-  \"On the summit of mount Olympus, in a forest of dwarf firs, lay anold stag.\"\\nHis eyes  were heavy with tears, and glittering with colorslike dewdrops; and there came by  a roebuck, and said, \\'What ailestthee, that thou weepest blue and red tears?\\' And  the stag answered,\\'The Turk has come to our city; he has wild dogs for the chase,  agoodly pack.\\' \\'I will drive them away across the islands!\\' cried theyoung roebuck;  \\'I will drive them away across the islands into thedeep sea.\\' But before evening the  roebuck was slain, and beforenight the hunted stag was dead.\"\\n  And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist; andon the long eyelashes  were tears, but she concealed them and watchedthe black bread baking in the ashes.\"\\n Then I would clench my fist,and cry, \"We will kill these Turks!\"\\n But she repeated  the words of thesong, \"I will drive them across the islands to the deep sea; butbefore  evening came the roebuck was slain, and before the night thehunted stag was dead.\"\\n  We had been lonely in our hut for several days and nights whenmy father came home.\"\\n I knew he would bring me some shells from thegulf of Lepanto, or perhaps a knife with  a shining blade.\"\\nThis time hebrought, under his sheep-skin cloak, a little child,  a littlehalf-naked girl.\"\\nShe was wrapped in a fur; but when this was takenoff, and  she lay in my mother\\'s lap, three silver coins were foundfastened in her dark hair;  they were all her possessions.\"\\nMy fathertold us that the child\\'s parents had been  killed by the Turks, andhe talked so much about them that I dreamed of Turks all night.\"\\n Hehimself had been wounded, and my mother bound up his arm.\"\\nIt was adeep wound, and  the thick sheep-skin cloak was stiff with congealedblood.\"\\nThe little maiden was to  be my sister.\"\\nHow pretty and brightshe looked: even my mother\\'s eyes were not more  gentle than hers.Anastasia, as she was called, was to be my sister, because herfather  had been united to mine by an old custom, which we stillfollow.\"\\nThey had sworn  brotherhood in their youth, and the mostbeautiful and virtuous maiden in the  neighborhood was chosen toperform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship.\"\\n So nowthis little girl was my sister.\"\\nShe sat in my lap, and I brought herflowers,  and feathers from the birds of the mountain.\"\\nWe dranktogether of the waters of  Parnassus, and dwelt for many yearsbeneath the laurel roof of the hut, while, winter  after winter, mymother sang her song of the stag who shed red tears.\"\\nBut as yet Idid  not understand that the sorrows of my own countrymen were mirroredin those tears.\"\\n One day there came to our hut Franks, men from a far country,whose dress was different  to ours.\"\\nThey had tents and beds withthem, carried by horses; and they were accompanied  by more than twentyTurks, all armed with swords and muskets.\"\\nThese Franks were friends  ofthe Pacha, and had letters from him, commanding an escort for them.They only came  to see our mountain, to ascend Parnassus amid thesnow and clouds, and to look at the  strange black rocks which raisedtheir steep sides near our hut.\"\\nThey could not find  room in the hut,nor endure the smoke that rolled along the ceiling till it found itsway  out at the low door; so they pitched their tents on a smallspace outside our dwelling.\"\\n Roasted lambs and birds were broughtforth, and strong, sweet wine, of which the Turks  are forbidden topartake.\"\\n When they departed, I accompanied them for some distance, carryingmy little sister  Anastasia, wrapped in a goat-skin, on my back.\"\\nOne ofthe Frankish gentlemen made me  stand in front of a rock, and drew usboth as we stood there, so that we looked like  one creature.\"\\nI did notthink of it then, but Anastasia and I were really one.\"\\nShe  wasalways sitting on my lap, or riding in the goat-skin on my back; andin my dreams  she always appeared to me.\"\\n Two nights after this, other men, armed with knives and muskets,came into our tent.\"\\n They were Albanians, brave men, my mother told me.They only stayed a short time.\"\\nMy  sister Anastasia sat on the kneeof one of them; and when they were gone, she had not  three, but twosilver coins in her hair- one had disappeared.\"\\nThey wrapped tobacco  instrips of paper, and smoked it; and I remember they were uncertainas to the road  they ought to take.\"\\nBut they were obliged to go atlast, and my father went with them.\"\\n Soon after, we heard the soundof firing.\"\\nThe noise continued, and presently soldiers  rushed into ourhut, and took my mother and myself and Anastasia prisoners.\"\\n Theydeclared that we had entertained robbers, and that my father had actedas their  guide, and therefore we must now go with them.\"\\nThe corpses ofthe robbers, and my  father\\'s corpse, were brought into the hut.\"\\nIsaw my poor dead father, and cried till  I fell asleep.\"\\nWhen I awoke, Ifound myself in a prison; but the room was not worse  than our own inthe hut.\"\\nThey gave me onions and musty wine from a tarred cask; but  wewere not accustomed to much better fare at home.\"\\nHow long we were keptin prison,  I do not know; but many days and nights passed by.\"\\nWewere set free about Easter-time.\"\\n I carried Anastasia on my back, andwe walked very slowly; for my mother was very weak,  and it is a longway to the sea, to the Gulf of Lepanto.\"\\n On our arrival, we entered a church, in which there were beautifulpictures in golden  frames.\"\\nThey were pictures of angels, fair andbright; and yet our little Anastasia  looked equally beautiful, as itseemed to me.\"\\nIn the centre of the floor stood a coffin  filled withroses.\"\\nMy mother told me it was the Lord Jesus Christ who wasrepresented  by these roses.\"\\nThen the priest announced, \"Christ isrisen,\" and all the people  greeted each other.\"\\nEach one carried aburning taper in his hand, and one was given  to me, as well as tolittle Anastasia.\"\\nThe music sounded, and the people left the  churchhand-in-hand, with joy and gladness.\"\\nOutside, the women wereroasting the  paschal lamb.\"\\nWe were invited to partake; and as I sat bythe fire, a boy, older than  myself, put his arms round my neck, andkissed me, and said, \"Christ is risen.\"\\n And  thus it was that for thefirst time I met Aphtanides.\"\\n My mother could make fishermen\\'s nets, for which there was a greatdemand here in the  bay; and we lived a long time by the side of thesea, the beautiful sea, that had a  taste like tears, and in its colorsreminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for  sometimes itswaters were red, and sometimes green or blue.\"\\nAphtanides knew how  tomanage our boat, and I often sat in it, with my little Anastasia,while it glided  on through the water, swift as a bird flying throughthe air.\"\\nThen, when the sun set,  how beautifully, deeply blue, wouldbe the tint on the mountains, one rising above  the other in the fardistance, and the summit of mount Parnassus rising above them  all likea glorious crown.\"\\nIts top glittered in the evening rays like moltengold, and  it seemed as if the light came from within it; for longafter the sun had sunk beneath  the horizon, the mountain-top wouldglow in the clear, blue sky.\"\\nThe white aquatic  birds skimmed thesurface of the water in their flight, and all was calm and still  asamid the black rocks at Delphi.\"\\nI lay on my back in the boat,Anastasia leaned against  me, while the stars above us glittered morebrightly than the lamps in our church.\"\\n They were the same stars, andin the same position over me as when I used to sit in  front of our hutat Delphi, and I had almost begun to fancy I was still there,  whensuddenly there was a splash in the water- Anastasia had fallen in; butin a moment  Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holdingher up to me.\"\\nWe dried her  clothes as well as we were able, andremained on the water till they were dry; for  we did not wish it to beknown what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our  littleadopted sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now a part.\"\\n The summer came, and the burning heat of the sun tinted the leavesof the trees with  lines of gold.\"\\nI thought of our coolmountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed  near it; my mother,too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home.\"\\n Howpeaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wildthyme, still  fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves.\"\\nNot asingle herdsman did we meet,  not a solitary hut did we pass;everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a  shooting star showedthat in the heavens there was yet life.\"\\nI know not whether theclear,  blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if theradiance came from the stars;  but we could distinguish quite plainlythe outline of the mountains.\"\\nMy mother lighted  a fire, and roastedsome roots she had brought with her, and I and my little sisterslept  among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki, fromwhose throat issues fire,  or of the wolf and the jackal; for my mothersat by us, and I considered her presence  sufficient protection.\"\\n We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and wehad to build a new one.\"\\n With the aid of some neighbors, chiefly women,the walls were in a few days erected,  and very soon covered with aroof of olive-branches.\"\\nMy mother obtained a living by  makingbottle-cases of bark and skins, and I kept the sheep belonging tothe priests,  who were sometimes peasants, while I had for myplayfellows Anastasia and the turtles.\"\\n Once our beloved Aphtanides paid us a visit.\"\\nHe said he had beenlonging to see us  so much; and he remained with us two whole happydays.\"\\nA month afterwards he came again  to wish us good-bye, andbrought with him a large fish for my mother.\"\\nHe told us he  was goingin a ship to Corfu and Patras, and could relate a great manystories, not  only about the fishermen who lived near the gulf ofLepanto, but also of kings and  heroes who had once possessed Greece,just as the Turks possess it now.\"\\n I have seen a bud on a rose-bush gradually, in the course of a fewweeks, unfold its  leaves till it became a rose in all its beauty; and,before I was aware of it, I beheld  it blooming in rosy loveliness.\"\\nThesame thing had happened to Anastasia.\"\\nUnnoticed  by me, she hadgradually become a beautiful maiden, and I was now also a stout,strong  youth.\"\\nThe wolf-skins that covered the bed in which my motherand Anastasia slept,  had been taken from wolves which I had myselfshot.\"\\n Years had gone by when, one evening, Aphtanides came in.\"\\nHe hadgrown tall and slender  as a reed, with strong limbs, and a dark, brownskin.\"\\nHe kissed us all, and had so  much to tell of what he had seen ofthe great ocean, of the fortifications at Malta,  and of the marvelloussepulchres of Egypt, that I looked up to him with a kind  ofveneration.\"\\nHis stories were as strange as the legends of thepriests of olden times.\"\\n \"How much you know!\"\\n I exclaimed, \"and what wonders you canrelate?\"\\n  \"I think what you once told me, the finest of all,\" he replied;\"you told me of a thing  that has never been out of my thoughts- of thegood old custom of \\'the bond of  friendship,\\'- a custom I should liketo follow.\"\\nBrother, let you and I go to church,  as your father andAnastasia\\'s father once did.\"\\nYour sister Anastasia is the  mostbeautiful and most innocent of maidens, and she shall consecrate thedeed.\"\\nNo  people have such grand old customs as we Greeks.\"\\n  Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissedAphtanides.\"\\n At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on the hillis sheltered by a  few scattered trees, stood the little church, with asilver lamp hanging before the  altar.\"\\nI put on my best clothes, andthe white tunic fell in graceful folds over my  hips.\"\\nThe red jacketfitted tight and close, the tassel on my Fez cap was of silver,  and inmy girdle glittered a knife and my pistols.\"\\nAphtanides was clad in theblue dress  worn by the Greek sailors; on his breast hung a silvermedal with the figure of the  Virgin Mary, and his scarf was ascostly as those worn by rich lords.\"\\nEvery one could  see that we wereabout to perform a solemn ceremony.\"\\nWhen we entered the  little,unpretending church, the evening sunlight streamed through the opendoor on  the burning lamp, and glittered on the golden pictureframes.\"\\nWe knelt down together  on the altar steps, and Anastasiadrew near and stood beside us.\"\\nA long, white garment  fell ingraceful folds over her delicate form, and on her white neck and bosomhung  a chain entwined with old and new coins, forming a kind ofcollar.\"\\nHer black hair was  fastened into a knot, and confined by aheaddress formed of gold and silver coins which  had been found in anancient temple.\"\\nNo Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than  these.Her countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars.\"\\nWe all threeoffered  a silent prayer, and then she said to us, \"Will you be friendsin life and in death?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" we replied.\"\\n \"Will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, \\'My brotheris a part of myself;  his secret is my secret, my happiness is his;self-sacrifice, patience, everything  belongs to me as they do tohim?\\'\"  And we again answered, \"Yes.\"\\n Then she joined out hands and kissedus on the forehead,  and we again prayed silently.\"\\nAfter this apriest came through a door near the altar,  and blessed us all three.Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the altar-screen,  andthe bond of eternal friendship was confirmed.\"\\nWhen we arose, I sawmy mother  standing by the church door, weeping.\"\\n How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage by theDelphian springs!\"\\nOn  the evening before his departure, Aphtanidessat thoughtfully beside me on the slopes  of the mountain.\"\\nHis armwas flung around me, and mine was round his neck.\"\\nWe spoke  of thesorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country who could be trusted.Every  thought of our souls lay clear before us.\"\\nPresently I seized hishand: \"Aphtanides,\"  I exclaimed, \"there is one thing still that youmust know,- one thing that till now  has been a secret between myselfand Heaven.\"\\nMy whole soul is filled with love,- with  a love strongerthan the love I bear to my mother and to thee.\"\\n \"And whom do you love?\"\\n asked Aphtanides.\"\\nAnd his face and neckgrew red as fire.\"\\n \"I love Anastasia,\" I replied.\"\\n Then his hand trembled in mine, and he became pale as a corpse.I saw it, I understood  the cause, and I believe my hand trembledtoo.\"\\nI bent towards him, I kissed his forehead,  and whispered, \"I havenever spoken of this to her, and perhaps she does not love  me.Brother, think of this; I have seen her daily, she has grown up besideme, and has  become a part of my soul.\"\\n  \"And she shall be thine,\" he exclaimed; \"thine!\"\\nI may not wrongthee, nor will I do  so.\"\\nI also love her, but tomorrow I depart.\"\\nIn ayear we will see each other again,  but then you will be married; shallit not be so?\"\\nI have a little gold of my own, it  shall be yours.\"\\nYoumust and shall take it.\"\\n  We wandered silently homeward across the mountains.\"\\nIt was late inthe evening when  we reached my mother\\'s door.\"\\nAnastasia held thelamp as we entered; my mother was not  there.\"\\nShe looked atAphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her  face.\"\\nTo-morrow you are going to leave us,\" she said.\"\\n\"I am very sorry.\"\\n  \"Sorry!\"\\n he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a griefas deep as my own.\"\\nI  could not speak; but he seized her hand and said,\"Our brother yonder loves you, and  is he not dear to you?\"\\nHis verysilence now proves his affection.\"\\n  Anastasia trembled, and burst into tears.\"\\nThen I saw no one,thought of none, but her.\"\\n I threw my arms round her, and pressed mylips to hers.\"\\nAs she flung her arms round  my neck, the lamp fell tothe ground, and we were in darkness, dark as the heart of  poorAphtanides.\"\\n Before daybreak he rose, kissed us all, and said \"Farewell,\" andwent away.\"\\nHe had  given all his money to my mother for us.\"\\nAnastasiawas betrothed to me, and in a few  days afterwards she became my wife.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SHIRT-COLLAR  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other things aboot-jack and a  hair-brush; but he had also the finest shirt-collar inthe world, and of this collar  we are about to hear a story.\"\\nThe collarhad become so old that he began to think about  getting married; andone day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as  agarter.\"\\n\"Upon my word,\" said the shirt-collar, \"I have never seenanything so slim  and delicate, so neat and soft before.\"\\nMay Iventure to ask your name?\"\\n  \"I shall not tell you,\" replied the garter.\"\\n \"Where do you reside when you are at home?\"\\n asked theshirt-collar.\"\\nBut the garter  was naturally shy, and did not know howto answer such a question.\"\\n \"I presume you are a girdle,\" said the shirt-collar, \"a sort ofunder girdle.\"\\nI see  that you are useful, as well as ornamental, mylittle lady.\"\\n  \"You must not speak to me,\" said the garter; \"I do not think Ihave given you any  encouragement to do so.\"\\n  \"Oh, when any one is as beautiful as you are,\" said theshirt-collar, \"is not that  encouragement enough?\"\\n  \"Get away; don\\'t come so near me,\" said the garter, \"you appear tome quite like a  man.\"\\n  \"I am a fine gentleman certainly,\" said the shirt-collar, \"Ipossess a boot-jack and  a hair-brush.\"\\n This was not true, for thesethings belonged to his master; but he was  a boaster.\"\\n \"Don\\'t come so near me,\" said the garter; \"I am not accustomedto it.\"\\n  \"Affectation!\"\\n said the shirt-collar.\"\\n Then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hungover a chair in the  sunshine, and then laid on the ironing-board.And now came the glowing iron.\"\\n\"Mistress  widow,\" said theshirt-collar, \"little mistress widow, I feel quite warm.\"\\nI amchanging,  I am losing all my creases.\"\\nYou are burning a hole in me.Ugh!\"\\nI propose to you.\"\\n  \"You old rag,\" said the flat-iron, driving proudly over thecollar, for she fancied  herself a steam-engine, which rolls over therailway and draws carriages.\"\\n\"You old  rag!\"\\n said she.\"\\n The edges of the shirt-collar were a little frayed, so thescissors were brought to  cut them smooth.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n exclaimed theshirt-collar, \"what a first-rate dancer you would  make; you canstretch out your leg so well.\"\\nI never saw anything so charming; I amsure  no human being could do the same.\"\\n  \"I should think not,\" replied the scissors.\"\\n \"You ought to be a countess,\" said the shirt collar;

\"Iam engaged to the  boot-jack.\"\\n  \"Engaged!\"\\n cried the shirt collar, \"now there is no one left topropose to;\" and then  he pretended to despise all love-making.\"\\n A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a bag to thepaper-mill.\"\\nHere  was a large company of rags, the fine ones lying bythemselves, separated from the  coarser, as it ought to be.\"\\nThey hadall many things to relate, especially the shirt  collar, who was aterrible boaster.\"\\n\"I have had an immense number of love affairs,\"  saidthe shirt collar, \"no one left me any peace.\"\\nIt is true I was a veryfine gentleman;

well, it must go on its travels with  me now!\"\\nand the shilling jumped and rattled for joy, when it was put backagain into  the purse.\"\\n Here it lay among a number of foreign companions, who werealways coming and going,  one taking the place of another, but theshilling from home was always put back, and  had to remain in thepurse, which was certainly a mark of distinction.\"\\nMany weeks  passed,during which the shilling had travelled a long distance in thepurse, without  in the least knowing where he was.\"\\nHe had found outthat the other coins were French  and Italian; and one coin said theywere in this town, and another said they were in  that, but theshilling was unable to make out or imagine what they meant.\"\\nA mancertainly  cannot see much of the world if he is tied up in a bag,and this was really the shilling\\'s  fate.\"\\nBut one day, as he waslying in the purse, he noticed that it was not quite closed,  and so heslipped near to the opening to have a little peep into society.\"\\nHecertainly  had not the least idea of what would follow, but he wascurious, and curiosity often  brings its own punishment.\"\\nIn hiseagerness, he came so near the edge of the purse  that he slipped outinto the pocket of the trousers; and when, in the evening, the  pursewas taken out, the shilling was left behind in the corner to whichit had fallen.\"\\n As the clothes were being carried into the hall, theshilling fell out on the floor,  unheard and unnoticed by any one.The next morning the clothes were taken back to the  room, thegentleman put them on, and started on his journey again; but theshilling  remained behind on the floor.\"\\nAfter a time it was found,and being considered a good  coin, was placed with three other coins.\"\\nAh,\" thought the shilling, \"this is pleasant;  I shall now see theworld, become acquainted with other people, and learn other  customs.\"\\n  \"Do you call that a shilling?\"\\n said some one the next moment.\"\\nThat is not a genuine  coin of the country,- it is false; it is goodfor nothing.\"\\n  Now begins the story as it was afterwards related by theshilling himself.\"\\n \"\\'False!\"\\ngood for nothing!\\' said he.\"\\nThat remark went throughand through me like a  dagger.\"\\nI knew that I had a true ring, andthat mine was a genuine stamp.\"\\nThese people  must at all events bewrong, or they could not mean me.\"\\nBut yes, I was the one they  called\\'false, and good for nothing.\\'  \"\\'Then I must pay it away in the dark,\\' said the man who hadreceived me.\"\\nSo I was  to be got rid of in the darkness, and be againinsulted in broad daylight.\"\\n \"\\'False!\"\\ngood for nothing!\\' Oh, I must contrive to get lost,thought I.\"\\nAnd I trembled  between the fingers of the people every timethey tried to pass me off slyly as a coin  of the country.\"\\nAh!unhappy shilling that I was!\"\\nOf what use were my silver, my stamp,  andmy real value here, where all these qualities were worthless.\"\\nIn theeyes of the  world, a man is valued just according to the opinionformed of him.\"\\nIt must be a shocking  thing to have a guiltyconscience, and to be sneaking about on account of wicked deeds.\"\\n Asfor me, innocent as I was, I could not help shuddering before theireyes whenever  they brought me out, for I knew I should be thrownback again up the table as a false  pretender.\"\\nAt length I was paidaway to a poor old woman, who received me as wages  for a hard day\\'swork.\"\\nBut she could not again get rid of me; no one would take me.\"\\n Iwas to the woman a most unlucky shilling.\"\\n\\'I am positively obligedto pass this  shilling to somebody,\\' said she; \\'I cannot, with the bestintentions, lay by a bad  shilling.\"\\nThe rich baker shall have it,- hecan bear the loss better than I can.\"\\nBut,  after all, it is not a rightthing to do.\\'  \"\\'Ah!\\' sighed I to myself, \\'am I also to be a burden on theconscience of this poor  woman?\"\\nAm I then in my old days socompletely changed?\\' The woman offered me to the  rich baker, but heknew the current money too well, and as soon as he received me hethrew  me almost in the woman\\'s face.\"\\nShe could get no bread for me,and I felt quite grieved  to the heart that I should be cause of somuch trouble to another, and be treated as  a cast-off coin.\"\\nI who,in my young days, felt so joyful in the certainty of my own  value, andknew so well that I bore a genuine stamp.\"\\nI was as sorrowful now asa poor  shilling can be when nobody will have him.\"\\nThe woman took mehome again with her, and  looking at me very earnestly, she said,\\'No, I will not try to deceive any one with  thee again.\"\\nI will borea hole through thee, that everyone may know that thou art a  falseand worthless thing; and yet, why should I do that?\"\\nVery likely thouart a lucky  shilling.\"\\nA thought has just struck me that it is so,and I believe it.\"\\nYes, I will  make a hole in the shilling,\\' saidshe, \\'and run a string through it, and then give  it to my neighbor\\'slittle one to hang round her neck, as a lucky shilling.\\' So  shedrilled a hole through me.\"\\n \"It is really not at all pleasant to have a hole bored throughone, but we can submit  to a great deal when it is done with a goodintention.\"\\nA string was drawn through the  hole, and I became a kind ofmedal.\"\\nThey hung me round the neck of a little child,  and the childlaughed at me and kissed me, and I rested for one whole night on thewarm,  innocent breast of a child.\"\\n \"In the morning the child\\'s mother took me between her fingers,and had certain  thoughts about me, which I very soon found out.\"\\nFirst,she looked for a pair of scissors,  and cut the string.\"\\n \"\\'Lucky shilling!\\' said she, \\'certainly this is what I mean totry.\\' Then she laid  me in vinegar till I became quite green, and afterthat she filled up the hole with  cement, rubbed me a little tobrighten me up, and went out in the twilight hour to  the lotterycollector, to buy herself a ticket, with a shilling that shouldbring luck.\"\\n How everything seemed to cause me trouble.\"\\nThe lotterycollector pressed me so hard  that I thought I should crack.\"\\nI had beencalled false, I had been thrown away,- that  I knew; and there weremany shillings and coins with inscriptions and stamps of all  kindslying about.\"\\nI well knew how proud they were, so I avoided them fromvery shame.\"\\n With the collector were several men who seemed to have agreat deal to do, so I fell  unnoticed into a chest, among severalother coins.\"\\n \"Whether the lottery ticket gained a prize, I know not; but this Iknow, that in a  very few days after, I was recognized as a badshilling, and laid aside.\"\\nEverything  that happened seemed always toadd to my sorrow.\"\\nEven if a man has a good character,  it is of nouse for him to deny what is said of him, for he is not considered animpartial  judge of himself.\"\\n \"A year passed, and in this way I had been changed from hand tohand; always abused,  always looked at with displeasure, and trusted byno one; but I trusted in myself,  and had no confidence in the world.Yes, that was a very dark time.\"\\n \"At length one day I was passed to a traveller, a foreigner, thevery same who had  brought me away from home; and he was simple andtrue-hearted enough to take me for  current coin.\"\\nBut would he alsoattempt to pass me?\"\\nand should I again hear the outcry,  \\'False!good-for-nothing!\\' The traveller examined me attentively, \\'I took theefor  good coin,\\' said he; then suddenly a smile spread all over hisface.\"\\nI have never seen  such a smile on any other face as on his.\"\\n\\'Nowthis is singular,\\' said he, \\'it is a  coin from my own country; a good,true, shilling from home.\"\\nSome one has bored a hole  through it, andpeople have no doubt called it false.\"\\nHow curious that it shouldcome  into my hands.\"\\nI will take it home with me to my own house.\\'  \\'Joy thrilled through me when I heard this.\"\\nI had been once morecalled a good, honest  shilling, and I was to go back to my own home,where each and all would recognize me,  and know that I was made ofgood silver, and bore a true, genuine stamp.\"\\nI should have  been gladin my joy to throw out sparks of fire, but it has never at any timebeen my  nature to sparkle.\"\\nSteel can do so, but not silver.\"\\nI waswrapped up in fine, white  paper, that I might not mix with the othercoins and be lost; and on special occasions,  when people from my owncountry happened to be present, I was brought forward and spoken  ofvery kindly.\"\\nThey said I was very interesting, and it was really quiteworth while  to notice that those who are interesting have often nota single word to say for  themselves.\"\\n \"At length I reached home.\"\\nAll my cares were at an end.\"\\nJoyagain overwhelmed me; for  was I not good silver, and had I not agenuine stamp?\"\\nI had no more insults or  disappointments to endure;although, indeed, there was a hole through me, as if I were  false; butsuspicions are nothing when a man is really true, and every one  shouldpersevere in acting honestly, for an will be made right in time.That is my firm  belief,\" said the shilling.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SNAIL AND THE ROSE-TREE  by Hans Christian Andersen  ROUND about the garden ran a hedge of hazel-bushes; beyond thehedge were fields and  meadows with cows and sheep; but in the middleof the garden stood a Rose-tree in bloom,  under which sat a Snail,whose shell contained a great deal- that is, himself.\"\\n \"Only wait till my time comes,\" he said; \"I shall do more thangrow roses, bear nuts,  or give milk, like the hazel-bush, the cows andthe sheep.\"\\n  \"I expect a great deal from you,\" said the rose-tree.\"\\n\"May I askwhen it will appear?\"\\n  \"I take my time,\" said the snail.\"\\n\"You\\'re always in such ahurry.\"\\nThat does not excite  expectation.\"\\n  The following year the snail lay in almost the same spot, in thesunshine under the  rose-tree, which was again budding and bearingroses as fresh and beautiful as ever.\"\\n The snail crept half out ofhis shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in again.\"\\n \"Everything is just as it was last year!\"\\nNo progress at all; therose-tree sticks to  its roses and gets no farther.\"\\n  The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses andbuds till the snow fell  and the weather became raw and wet; then itbent down its head, and the snail crept  into the ground.\"\\n A new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the snailmade his too.\"\\n \"You are an old rose-tree now,\" said the snail.\"\\n\"You must makehaste and die.\"\\nYou have  given the world all that you had in you;whether it was of much importance is a question  that I have not hadtime to think about.\"\\nBut this much is clear and plain, that you  havenot done the least for your inner development, or you would haveproduced something  else.\"\\nHave you anything to say in defence?\"\\nYou willnow soon be nothing but a stick.\"\\n Do you understand what I say?\"\\n  \"You frighten me,\" said the rose- tree.\"\\n\"I have never thought ofthat.\"\\n  \"No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all.\"\\nHave youever given yourself  an account why you bloomed, and how yourblooming comes about- why just in that way  and in no other?\"\\n  \"No,\" said the rose-tree.\"\\n\"I bloom in gladness, because I cannotdo otherwise.\"\\nThe  sun shone and warmed me, and the air refreshed me; Idrank the clear dew and the  invigorating rain.\"\\nI breathed and I lived!Out of the earth there arose a power within  me, whilst from above Ialso received strength; I felt an ever-renewed and  ever-increasinghappiness, and therefore I was obliged to go on blooming.\"\\nThat wasmy  life; I could not do otherwise.\"\\n  \"You have led a very easy life,\" remarked the snail.\"\\n \"Certainly.\"\\nEverything was given me,\" said the rose-tree.\"\\n\"Butstill more was given  to you.\"\\nYours is one of those deep-thinkingnatures, one of those highly gifted minds  that astonishes the world.\"\\n  \"I have not the slightest intention of doing so,\" said thesnail.\"\\n\"The world is nothing  to me.\"\\nWhat have I to do with theworld?\"\\nI have enough to do with myself, and enough  in myself\"  \"But must we not all here on earth give up our best parts toothers, and offer as much  as lies in our power?\"\\nIt is true, I haveonly given roses.\"\\nBut you- you who are so  richly endowed- what haveyou given to the world?\"\\nWhat will you give it?\"\\n  \"What have I given?\"\\nWhat am I going to give?\"\\nI spit at it; it\\'sgood for nothing, and  does not concern me.\"\\nFor my part, you may goon bearing roses; you cannot do anything  else.\"\\nLet the hazel bush bearnuts, and the cows and sheep give milk; they have each  their public.\"\\nIhave mine in myself.\"\\nI retire within myself and there I stop.\"\\nTheworld  is nothing to me.\"\\n  With this the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up theentrance.\"\\n \"That\\'s very sad,\" said the rose tree.\"\\n\"I cannot creep intomyself, however much I  might wish to do so; I have to go on bearingroses.\"\\nThen they drop their leaves, which  are blown away by thewind.\"\\nBut I once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress\\'shymn-book,  and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom of ayoung beautiful girl, and how  another was kissed by the lips of achild in the glad joy of life.\"\\nThat did me good;  it was a realblessing.\"\\nThose are my recollections, my life.\"\\n  And the rose tree went on blooming in innocence, while the snaillay idling in his  house- the world was nothing to him.\"\\n Years passed by.\"\\n The snail had turned to earth in the earth, and the rose tree too.Even the souvenir  rose in the hymn-book was faded, but in the gardenthere were other rose trees and  other snails.\"\\nThe latter crept intotheir houses and spat at the world, for it did  not concern them.\"\\n Shall we read the story all over again?\"\\nIt will be just the same.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SNOW MAN  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"IT is so delightfully cold,\" said the Snow Man, \"that it makes mywhole body crackle.\"\\n This is just the kind of wind to blow life intoone.\"\\nHow that great red thing up there  is staring at me!\"\\n He meant thesun, who was just setting.\"\\n\"It shall not make me wink.\"\\n I shallmanage to keep the pieces.\"\\n  He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes;his mouth was made  of an old broken rake, and was, of course,furnished with teeth.\"\\nHe had been brought  into existence amidst thejoyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and  theslashing of whips.\"\\nThe sun went down, and the full moon rose, large,round, and  clear, shining in the deep blue.\"\\n \"There it comes again, from the other side,\" said the Snow Man,who supposed the sun  was showing himself once more.\"\\n\"Ah, I havecured him of staring, though; now he may  hang up there, and shine,that I may see myself.\"\\nIf I only knew how to manage to move  awayfrom this place,- I should so like to move.\"\\nIf I could, I wouldslide along yonder  on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I don\\'tunderstand how; I don\\'t even know  how to run.\"\\n  \"Away, away,\" barked the old yard-dog.\"\\nHe was quite hoarse, andcould not pronounce  \"Bow wow\" properly.\"\\nHe had once been an indoordog, and lay by the fire, and he had  been hoarse ever since.\"\\n\"Thesun will make you run some day.\"\\nI saw him, last winter,  make yourpredecessor run, and his predecessor before him.\"\\nAway, away, theyall have  to go.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t understand you, comrade,\" said the Snow Man.\"\\n\"Is thatthing up yonder to teach  me to run?\"\\nI saw it running itself a littlewhile ago, and now it has come creeping  up from the other side.\"\\n \"You know nothing at all,\" replied the yard-dog; \"but then, you\\'veonly lately been  patched up.\"\\nWhat you see yonder is the moon, andthe one before it was the sun.\"\\nIt  will come again to-morrow, andmost likely teach you to run down into the ditch by  the well; for Ithink the weather is going to change.\"\\nI can feel such pricks and stabsin  my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t understand him,\" said the Snow Man to himself; \"but Ihave a feeling that  he is talking of something very disagreeable.The one who stared so just now, and whom  he calls the sun, is not myfriend; I can feel that too.\"\\n  \"Away, away,\" barked the yard-dog, and then he turned roundthree times, and crept  into his kennel to sleep.\"\\n There was really a change in the weather.\"\\nTowards morning, a thickfog covered the  whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so thatthe cold seemed to freeze one\\'s  bones; but when the sun rose, thesight was splendid.\"\\nTrees and bushes were covered  with hoar frost, andlooked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig  glitteredfrozen dew-drops.\"\\nThe many delicate forms concealed in summer byluxuriant  foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked likeglittering lace-work.\"\\nFrom every  twig glistened a white radiance.The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life,  like trees insummer; and its appearance was wondrously beautiful.\"\\nAnd where the  sunshone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust hadbeen strewn  about; while the snowy carpet of the earth appeared asif covered with diamonds, from  which countless lights gleamed,whiter than even the snow itself.\"\\n \"This is really beautiful,\" said a young girl, who had come intothe garden with a  young man; and they both stood still near the SnowMan, and contemplated the glittering  scene.\"\\n\"Summer cannot show a morebeautiful sight,\" she exclaimed, while her eyes  sparkled.\"\\n \"And we can\\'t have such a fellow as this in the summer time,\"replied the young man,  pointing to the Snow Man; \"he is capital.\"\\n  The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then trippedaway over the snow with  her friend.\"\\nThe snow creaked and crackledbeneath her feet, as if she had been treading  on starch.\"\\n \"Who are these two?\"\\n asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog.\"\\n\"You havebeen here longer  than I have; do you know them?\"\\n  \"Of course I know them,\" replied the yard-dog; \"she has stroked myback many times,  and he has given me a bone of meat.\"\\nI never bitethose two.\"\\n  \"But what are they?\"\\n asked the Snow Man.\"\\n \"They are lovers,\" he replied; \"they will go and live in thesame kennel by-and-by,  and gnaw at the same bone.\"\\nAway, away!\"\\n  \"Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?\"\\n asked the SnowMan.\"\\n \"Well, they belong to the same master,\" retorted the yard-dog.\"\\nCertainly people who  were only born yesterday know very little.\"\\nI cansee that in you.\"\\nI have age and  experience.\"\\nI know every one here inthe house, and I know there was once a time when  I did not lie outhere in the cold, fastened to a chain.\"\\nAway, away!\"\\n  \"The cold is delightful,\" said the Snow Man; \"but do tell metell me; only you must  not clank your chain so; for it jars allthrough me when you do that.\"\\n  \"Away, away!\"\\n barked the yard-dog; \"I\\'ll tell you; they said I wasa pretty little  fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-coveredchair, up at the master\\'s house,  and sit in the mistress\\'s lap.\"\\nTheyused to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an  embroideredhandkerchief, and I was called \\'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.\\' But after awhile  I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to thehousekeeper\\'s room; so I came  to live on the lower story.\"\\nYou can lookinto the room from where you stand, and see  where I was master once;for I was indeed master to the housekeeper.\"\\nIt was certainly  a smallerroom than those up stairs; but I was more comfortable; for I was notbeing  continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children asI had been.\"\\nI received  quite as good food, or even better.\"\\nI had myown cushion, and there was a stove- it  is the finest thing in theworld at this season of the year.\"\\nI used to go under the  stove, andlie down quite beneath it.\"\\nAh, I still dream of that stove.\"\\nAway,away!\"\\n  \"Does a stove look beautiful?\"\\n asked the Snow Man, \"is it at alllike me?\"\\n  \"It is just the reverse of you,\\' said the dog; \"it\\'s as black as acrow, and has a  long neck and a brass knob; it eats firewood, sothat fire spurts out of its mouth.\"\\n We should keep on one side, orunder it, to be comfortable.\"\\nYou can see it through  the window, fromwhere you stand.\"\\n  Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with abrazen knob, and fire  gleaming from the lower part of it.\"\\nThe Snow Manfelt quite a strange sensation come  over him; it was very odd, he knewnot what it meant, and he could not account for  it.\"\\nBut there arepeople who are not men of snow, who understand what it is.\"\\n\"\\'And  whydid you leave her?\"\\n asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him thatthe stove must  be of the female sex.\"\\n\"How could you give up such acomfortable place?\"\\n  \"I was obliged,\" replied the yard-dog.\"\\n\"They turned me out ofdoors, and chained me  up here.\"\\nI had bitten the youngest of mymaster\\'s sons in the leg, because he kicked  away the bone I wasgnawing.\"\\n\\'Bone for bone,\\' I thought; but they were so angry, andfrom  that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone.Don\\'t you hear how hoarse  I am.\"\\nAway, away!\"\\nI can\\'t talk any more likeother dogs.\"\\nAway, away, that is the end  of it all.\"\\n  But the Snow Man was no longer listening.\"\\nHe was looking intothe housekeeper\\'s room  on the lower storey; where the stove stood onits four iron legs, looking about the  same size as the Snow Manhimself.\"\\n\"What a strange crackling I feel within me,\" he  said.\"\\nShall I ever get in there?\"\\nIt is an innocent wish, and innocentwishes are sure  to be fulfilled.\"\\nI must go in there and lean againsther, even if I have to break the  window.\"\\n  \"You must never go in there,\" said the yard-dog, \"for if youapproach the stove, you\\'ll  melt away, away.\"\\n  \"I might as well go,\" said the Snow Man, \"for I think I ambreaking up as it is.\"\\n  During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through thewindow, and in the  twilight hour the room became still moreinviting, for from the stove came a gentle  glow, not like the sun orthe moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove  whenit has been well fed.\"\\nWhen the door of the stove was opened, theflames darted  out of its mouth; this is customary with all stoves.\"\\nThelight of the flames fell  directly on the face and breast of the SnowMan with a ruddy gleam.\"\\n\"I can endure it  no longer,\" said he; \"howbeautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?\"\\n  The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, whostood there enjoying  his own reflections, and crackling with the cold.In the morning, the window-panes  of the housekeeper\\'s room werecovered with ice.\"\\nThey were the most beautiful  ice-flowers any SnowMan could desire, but they concealed the stove.\"\\nThese  window-paneswould not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which hepictured  to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being.\"\\nThesnow crackled and the wind  whistled around him; it was just the kindof frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly  enjoy.\"\\nBut he did notenjoy it; how, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was  \"stovesick?\"\\n  \"That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,\" said the yard-dog; \"Ihave suffered from  it myself, but I got over it.\"\\nAway, away,\" hebarked and then he added, \"the weather  is going to change.\"\\n And theweather did change; it began to thaw.\"\\nAs the warmth  increased, theSnow Man decreased.\"\\nHe said nothing and made no complaint, which isa  sure sign.\"\\nOne morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and,behold, where he had  stood, something like a broomstick remainedsticking up in the ground.\"\\nIt was the pole  round which the boys hadbuilt him up.\"\\n\"Ah, now I understand why he had such a great  longingfor the stove,\" said the yard-dog.\"\\n\"Why, there\\'s the shovel that isused for  cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole.\"\\n The Snow Manhad a stove scraper in  his body; that was what moved him so.\"\\n\"But it\\'sall over now.\"\\nAway, away.\"\\n And soon  the winter passed.\"\\n\"Away, away,\"barked the hoarse yard-dog.\"\\nBut the girls in the house  sang,  \"Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;  Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree;  The months are bringing the sweet spring-time,  When the lark in the sky sings joyfully.\"\\n Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings,  And I\\'ll mock his note in my wanderings.\"\\n  And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SNOW QUEEN  IN SEVEN STORIES  by Hans Christian Andersen  STORY THE FIRST  WHICH describes a looking-glass and the broken fragments.\"\\n You must attend to the commencement of this story, for when we getto the end we shall  know more than we do now about a very wickedhobgoblin; he was one of the very worst,  for he was a real demon.One day, when he was in a merry mood, he made a looking-glass  whichhad the power of making everything good or beautiful that wasreflected in it  almost shrink to nothing, while everything that wasworthless and bad looked increased  in size and worse than ever.\"\\nThemost lovely landscapes appeared like boiled spinach,  and the peoplebecame hideous, and looked as if they stood on their heads and hadno  bodies.\"\\nTheir countenances were so distorted that no one couldrecognize them, and  even one freckle on the face appeared to spreadover the whole of the nose and mouth.\"\\n The demon said this was veryamusing.\"\\nWhen a good or pious thought passed through the  mind of anyone it was misrepresented in the glass; and then how the demon laughedat  his cunning invention.\"\\nAll who went to the demon\\'s school- for hekept a school- talked  everywhere of the wonders they had seen, anddeclared that people could now, for the  first time, see what the worldand mankind were really like.\"\\nThey carried the glass  about everywhere,till at last there was not a land nor a people who had not been  lookedat through this distorted mirror.\"\\nThey wanted even to fly with it upto heaven  to see the angels, but the higher they flew the moreslippery the glass became, and  they could scarcely hold it, till atlast it slipped from their hands, fell to the  earth, and was brokeninto millions of pieces.\"\\nBut now the looking-glass caused  moreunhappiness than ever, for some of the fragments were not so largeas a grain of  sand, and they flew about the world into everycountry.\"\\nWhen one of these tiny atoms  flew into a person\\'s eye, itstuck there unknown to him, and from that moment he saw  everythingthrough a distorted medium, or could see only the worst side of whathe  looked at, for even the smallest fragment retained the same powerwhich had belonged  to the whole mirror.\"\\nSome few persons even got afragment of the looking-glass in their  hearts, and this was veryterrible, for their hearts became cold like a lump of ice.\"\\n A few ofthe pieces were so large that they could be used as window-panes; itwould  have been a sad thing to look at our friends through them.\"\\nOtherpieces were made into  spectacles; this was dreadful for those who worethem, for they could see nothing  either rightly or justly.\"\\nAt all thisthe wicked demon laughed till his sides shook\\ufffeit tickled him so tosee the mischief he had done.\"\\nThere were still a number of  theselittle fragments of glass floating about in the air, and now you shallhear what  happened with one of them.\"\\n SECOND STORY  A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL  In a large town, full of houses and people, there is not roomfor everybody to have  even a little garden, therefore they are obligedto be satisfied with a few flowers  in flower-pots.\"\\nIn one of theselarge towns lived two poor children who had a garden  somethinglarger and better than a few flower-pots.\"\\nThey were not brother andsister,  but they loved each other almost as much as if they hadbeen.\"\\nTheir parents lived  opposite to each other in two garrets, wherethe roofs of neighboring houses projected  out towards each other andthe water-pipe ran between them.\"\\nIn each house was a little  window, sothat any one could step across the gutter from one window to theother.\"\\nThe  parents of these children had each a large wooden box inwhich they cultivated kitchen  herbs for their own use, and a littlerose-bush in each box, which grew splendidly.\"\\n Now after a while theparents decided to place these two boxes across the water-pipe,  sothat they reached from one window to the other and looked like twobanks of flowers.\"\\n Sweet-peas drooped over the boxes, and therose-bushes shot forth long branches, which  were trained round thewindows and clustered together almost like a triumphal arch  ofleaves and flowers.\"\\nThe boxes were very high, and the children knewthey must not  climb upon them, without permission, but they wereoften, however, allowed to step  out together and sit upon their littlestools under the rose-bushes, or play quietly.\"\\n In winter all thispleasure came to an end, for the windows were sometimes quite  frozenover.\"\\nBut then they would warm copper pennies on the stove, and holdthe warm  pennies against the frozen pane; there would be very soon alittle round hole through  which they could peep, and the soft brighteyes of the little boy and girl would beam  through the hole at eachwindow as they looked at each other.\"\\nTheir names were Kay  and Gerda.In summer they could be together with one jump from the window, but inwinter  they had to go up and down the long staircase, and outthrough the snow before they  could meet.\"\\n \"See there are the white bees swarming,\" said Kay\\'s oldgrandmother one day when it  was snowing.\"\\n \"Have they a queen bee?\"\\n asked the little boy, for he knew thatthe real bees had a  queen.\"\\n \"To be sure they have,\" said the grandmother.\"\\n\"She is flying therewhere the swarm  is thickest.\"\\nShe is the largest of them all, and neverremains on the earth, but flies  up to the dark clouds.\"\\nOften atmidnight she flies through the streets of the town,  and looks in atthe windows, then the ice freezes on the panes into wonderfulshapes,  that look like flowers and castles.\"\\n  \"Yes, I have seen them,\" said both the children, and they knewit must be true.\"\\n \"Can the Snow Queen come in here?\"\\n asked the little girl.\"\\n \"Only let her come,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ll set her on the stoveand then she\\'ll melt.\"\\n  Then the grandmother smoothed his hair and told him some moretales.\"\\nOne evening, when  little Kay was at home, half undressed, heclimbed on a chair by the window and peeped  out through the littlehole.\"\\nA few flakes of snow were falling, and one of them,  ratherlarger than the rest, alighted on the edge of one of the flower boxes.This  snow-flake grew larger and larger, till at last it became thefigure of a woman, dressed  in garments of white gauze, which lookedlike millions of starry snow-flakes linked  together.\"\\nShe was fairand beautiful, but made of ice- shining and glittering ice.\"\\n Stillshe was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there wasneither peace  nor rest in their glance.\"\\nShe nodded towards thewindow and waved her hand.\"\\nThe little  boy was frightened and sprangfrom the chair; at the same moment it seemed as if a  large bird flewby the window.\"\\nOn the following day there was a clear frost, andvery  soon came the spring.\"\\nThe sun shone; the young green leaves burstforth; the swallows  built their nests; windows were opened, and thechildren sat once more in the garden  on the roof, high above all theother rooms.\"\\nHow beautiful the roses blossomed this  summer.\"\\nThe littlegirl had learnt a hymn in which roses were spoken of, and then  shethought of their own roses, and she sang the hymn to the little boy,and he sang  too:-  \"Roses bloom and cease to be,  But we shall the Christ-child see.\"\\nThen the little ones held each other by the  hand, and kissed theroses, and looked at the bright sunshine, and spoke to it as if  theChrist-child were there.\"\\nThose were splendid summer days.\"\\nHowbeautiful and fresh  it was out among the rose-bushes, which seemedas if they would never leave off blooming.\"\\n One day Kay and Gerda satlooking at a book full of pictures of animals and birds,  and then justas the clock in the church tower struck twelve, Kay said, \"Oh,something  has struck my heart!\"\\n and soon after, \"There is something inmy eye.\"\\n  The little girl put her arm round his neck, and looked into hiseye, but she could  see nothing.\"\\n \"I think it is gone,\" he said.\"\\nBut it was not gone; it was oneof those bits of the  looking-glass- that magic mirror, of which wehave spoken- the ugly glass which made  everything great and goodappear small and ugly, while all that was wicked and bad  became morevisible, and every little fault could be plainly seen.\"\\nPoor little Kayhad  also received a small grain in his heart, which very quicklyturned to a lump of ice.\"\\n He felt no more pain, but the glass was therestill.\"\\n\"Why do you cry?\"\\n said he at last;  \"it makes you look ugly.There is nothing the matter with me now.\"\\nOh, see!\"\\n he  criedsuddenly, \"that rose is worm-eaten, and this one is quite crooked.After all they  are ugly roses, just like the box in which they stand,\"and then he kicked the boxes  with his foot, and pulled off the tworoses.\"\\n \"Kay, what are you doing?\"\\n cried the little girl; and then, whenhe saw how frightened  she was, he tore off another rose, and jumpedthrough his own window away from little  Gerda.\"\\n When she afterwards brought out the picture book, he said, \"It wasonly fit for babies  in long clothes,\" and when grandmother told anystories, he would interrupt her with  \"but;\" or, when he could manageit, he would get behind her chair, put on a pair of  spectacles, andimitate her very cleverly, to make people laugh.\"\\nBy-and-by he began  tomimic the speech and gait of persons in the street.\"\\nAll that waspeculiar or  disagreeable in a person he would imitate directly, andpeople said, \"That boy will  be very clever; he has a remarkablegenius.\"\\n But it was the piece of glass in his eye,  and the coldness inhis heart, that made him act like this.\"\\nHe would even tease  littleGerda, who loved him with all her heart.\"\\nHis games, too, were quitedifferent;  they were not so childish.\"\\nOne winter\\'s day, when itsnowed, he brought out a  burning-glass, then he held out the tail ofhis blue coat, and let the snow-flakes  fall upon it.\"\\n\"Look in thisglass, Gerda,\" said he; and she saw how every flake of  snow wasmagnified, and looked like a beautiful flower or a glittering star.\"\\nIs it  not clever?\"\\n said Kay, \"and much more interesting thanlooking at real flowers.\"\\nThere  is not a single fault in it, and thesnow-flakes are quite perfect till they begin  to melt.\"\\n  Soon after Kay made his appearance in large thick gloves, and withhis sledge at his  back.\"\\nHe called up stairs to Gerda, \"I\\'ve got toleave to go into the great square,  where the other boys play andride.\"\\n And away he went.\"\\n In the great square, the boldest among the boys would often tietheir sledges to the  country people\\'s carts, and go with them a goodway.\"\\nThis was capital.\"\\nBut while they  were all amusing themselves, andKay with them, a great sledge came by; it was painted  white, and in itsat some one wrapped in a rough white fur, and wearing a white cap.The  sledge drove twice round the square, and Kay fastened his ownlittle sledge to it,  so that when it went away, he followed with it.It went faster and faster right through  the next street, and thenthe person who drove turned round and nodded pleasantly to  Kay, justas if they were acquainted with each other, but whenever Kay wished toloosen  his little sledge the driver nodded again, so Kay sat still,and they drove out through  the town gate.\"\\nThen the snow began tofall so heavily that the little boy could not  see a hand\\'s breadthbefore him, but still they drove on; then he suddenly loosened  thecord so that the large sled might go on without him, but it was ofno use, his little  carriage held fast, and away they went like thewind.\"\\nThen he called out loudly, but  nobody heard him, while thesnow beat upon him, and the sledge flew onwards.\"\\nEvery  now and then itgave a jump as if it were going over hedges and ditches.\"\\nThe boy  wasfrightened, and tried to say a prayer, but he could remember nothingbut the  multiplication table.\"\\n The snow-flakes became larger and larger, till they appearedlike great white chickens.\"\\n All at once they sprang on one side, thegreat sledge stopped, and the person who had  driven it rose up.\"\\nThefur and the cap, which were made entirely of snow, fell off,  and hesaw a lady, tall and white, it was the Snow Queen.\"\\n \"We have driven well,\" said she, \"but why do you tremble?\"\\nhere,creep into my warm  fur.\"\\n Then she seated him beside her in the sledge,and as she wrapped the fur round  him he felt as if he were sinkinginto a snow drift.\"\\n \"Are you still cold,\" she asked, as she kissed him on theforehead.\"\\nThe kiss was colder  than ice; it went quite through to hisheart, which was already almost a lump of ice;  he felt as if he weregoing to die, but only for a moment; he soon seemed quite wellagain,  and did not notice the cold around him.\"\\n \"My sledge!\"\\ndon\\'t forget my sledge,\" was his first thought, andthen he looked and  saw that it was bound fast to one of the whitechickens, which flew behind him with  the sledge at its back.\"\\nTheSnow Queen kissed little Kay again, and by this time he  hadforgotten little Gerda, his grandmother, and all at home.\"\\n \"Now you must have no more kisses,\" she said, \"or I should kissyou to death.\"\\n  Kay looked at her, and saw that she was so beautiful, he could notimagine a more lovely  and intelligent face; she did not now seem to bemade of ice, as when he had seen her  through his window, and she hadnodded to him.\"\\nIn his eyes she was perfect, and she  did not feel atall afraid.\"\\nHe told her he could do mental arithmetic, as far  asfractions, and that he knew the number of square miles and thenumber of inhabitants  in the country.\"\\nAnd she always smiled so that hethought he did not know enough yet,  and she looked round the vastexpanse as she flew higher and higher with him upon a  black cloud,while the storm blew and howled as if it were singing old songs.They flew  over woods and lakes, over sea and land; below them roaredthe wild wind; the wolves  howled and the snow crackled; over them flewthe black screaming crows, and above all  shone the moon, clear andbright,- and so Kay passed through the long winter\\'s night,  and by dayhe slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.\"\\n THIRD STORY  THE FLOWER GARDEN OF THE WOMAN  WHO COULD CONJURE  But how fared little Gerda during Kay\\'s absence?\"\\nWhat had becomeof him, no one knew,  nor could any one give the slightest information,excepting the boys, who said that  he had tied his sledge to anothervery large one, which had driven through the street,  and out at thetown gate.\"\\nNobody knew where it went; many tears were shed for him,and  little Gerda wept bitterly for a long time.\"\\nShe said she knew hemust be dead; that  he was drowned in the river which flowed close bythe school.\"\\nOh, indeed those long  winter days were very dreary.\"\\nBut atlast spring came, with warm sunshine.\"\\n\"Kay is  dead and gone,\" saidlittle Gerda.\"\\n \"I don\\'t believe it,\" said the sunshine.\"\\n \"He is dead and gone,\" she said to the sparrows.\"\\n \"We don\\'t believe it,\" they replied; and at last little Gerdabegan to doubt it herself.\"\\n \"I will put on my new red shoes,\" shesaid one morning, \"those that Kay has never seen,  and then I will godown to the river, and ask for him.\"\\n It was quite early when shekissed  her old grandmother, who was still asleep; then she put onher red shoes, and went  quite alone out of the town gates toward theriver.\"\\n\"Is it true that you have taken  my little playmate away fromme?\"\\n said she to the river.\"\\n\"I will give you my red shoes  if youwill give him back to me.\"\\n And it seemed as if the waves nodded to herin a strange  manner.\"\\nThen she took off her red shoes, which sheliked better than anything else,  and threw them both into the river,but they fell near the bank, and the little waves  carried them back tothe land, just as if the river would not take from her what sheloved  best, because they could not give her back little Kay.\"\\nBut shethought the shoes had  not been thrown out far enough.\"\\nThen she creptinto a boat that lay among the reeds,  and threw the shoes again fromthe farther end of the boat into the water, but it was  not fastened.And her movement sent it gliding away from the land.\"\\nWhen she saw thisshe  hastened to reach the end of the boat, but before she could soit was more than a yard  from the bank, and drifting away faster thanever.\"\\nThen little Gerda was very much  frightened, and began to cry,but no one heard her except the sparrows, and they could  not carry herto land, but they flew along by the shore, and sang, as if tocomfort  her, \"Here we are!\"\\nHere we are!\"\\n The boat floated with thestream; little Gerda sat  quite still with only her stockings on herfeet; the red shoes floated after her, but  she could not reach thembecause the boat kept so much in advance.\"\\nThe banks on each  side ofthe river were very pretty.\"\\nThere were beautiful flowers, old trees,sloping  fields, in which cows and sheep were grazing, but not a man tobe seen.\"\\nPerhaps the  river will carry me to little Kay, thought Gerda,and then she became more cheerful,  and raised her head, and lookedat the beautiful green banks; and so the boat sailed  on for hours.At length she came to a large cherry orchard, in which stood a smallred  house with strange red and blue windows.\"\\nIt had also a thatchedroof, and outside were  two wooden soldiers, that presented arms to heras she sailed past.\"\\nGerda called out  to them, for she thought theywere alive, but of course they did not answer; and as  the boat driftednearer to the shore, she saw what they really were.\"\\nThen Gerdacalled  still louder, and there came a very old woman out of the house,leaning on a crutch.\"\\n She wore a large hat to shade her from the sun,and on it were painted all sorts of  pretty flowers.\"\\n\"You poor littlechild,\" said the old woman, \"how did you manage to  come all thisdistance into the wide world on such a rapid rolling stream?\"\\n And thenthe  old woman walked in the water, seized the boat with her crutch,drew it to land, and  lifted Gerda out.\"\\nAnd Gerda was glad to feelherself on dry ground, although she was  rather afraid of the strangeold woman.\"\\n\"Come and tell me who you are,\" said she, \"and  how came youhere.\"\\n  Then Gerda told her everything, while the old woman shook herhead, and said,  \"Hem-hem;\" and when she had finished, Gerda asked ifshe had not seen little Kay, and  the old woman told her he had notpassed by that way, but he very likely would come.\"\\n So she told Gerdanot to be sorrowful, but to taste the cherries and look at theflowers;  they were better than any picture-book, for each of themcould tell a story.\"\\nThen she  took Gerda by the hand and led her intothe little house, and the old woman closed  the door.\"\\nThe windowswere very high, and as the panes were red, blue, and yellow,  thedaylight shone through them in all sorts of singular colors.\"\\nOn thetable stood  beautiful cherries, and Gerda had permission to eat asmany as she would.\"\\nWhile she  was eating them the old woman combedout her long flaxen ringlets with a golden comb,  and the glossycurls hung down on each side of the little round pleasant face,which  looked fresh and blooming as a rose.\"\\n\"I have long been wishingfor a dear little maiden  like you,\" said the old woman, \"and now youmust stay with me, and see how happily  we shall live together.\"\\n Andwhile she went on combing little Gerda\\'s hair, she thought  less andless about her adopted brother Kay, for the old woman could conjure,although  she was not a wicked witch; she conjured only a little forher own amusement, and now,  because she wanted to keep Gerda.Therefore she went into the garden, and stretched  out her crutchtowards all the rose-trees, beautiful though they were; and  theyimmediately sunk into the dark earth, so that no one could tellwhere they had  once stood.\"\\nThe old woman was afraid that if littleGerda saw roses she would think  of those at home, and then rememberlittle Kay, and run away.\"\\nThen she took Gerda into  theflower-garden.\"\\nHow fragrant and beautiful it was!\"\\nEvery flower thatcould be  thought of for every season of the year was here in fullbloom; no picture-book could  have more beautiful colors.\"\\nGerdajumped for joy, and played till the sun went down  behind the tallcherry-trees; then she slept in an elegant bed with red silkpillows,  embroidered with colored violets; and then she dreamed aspleasantly as a queen on  her wedding day.\"\\nThe next day, and for manydays after, Gerda played with the flowers  in the warm sunshine.\"\\nSheknew every flower, and yet, although there were so many of  them, itseemed as if one were missing, but which it was she could not tell.One day,  however, as she sat looking at the old woman\\'s hat with thepainted flowers on it,  she saw that the prettiest of them all was arose.\"\\nThe old woman had forgotten to take  it from her hat when shemade all the roses sink into the earth.\"\\nBut it is difficult  to keepthe thoughts together in everything; one little mistake upsets all  ourarrangements.\"\\n \"What, are there no roses here?\"\\n cried Gerda; and she ran out intothe garden, and  examined all the beds, and searched and searched.There was not one to be found.\"\\nThen  she sat down and wept, and hertears fell just on the place where one of the rose-trees  had sunkdown.\"\\nThe warm tears moistened the earth, and the rose-tree sproutedup at  once, as blooming as when it had sunk; and Gerda embraced it andkissed the roses,  and thought of the beautiful roses at home, and,with them, of little Kay.\"\\n \"Oh, how I have been detained!\"\\n said the little maiden, \"Iwanted to seek for little  Kay.\"\\nDo you know where he is?\"\\n she asked theroses; \"do you think he is dead?\"\\n  And the roses answered, \"No, he is not dead.\"\\nWe have been in theground where all the  dead lie; but Kay is not there.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said little Gerda, and then she went to the otherflowers, and looked  into their little cups, and asked, \"Do you knowwhere little Kay is?\"\\n But each flower,  as it stood in the sunshine,dreamed only of its own little fairy tale of history.\"\\n Not one knewanything of Kay.\"\\nGerda heard many stories from the flowers, as sheasked  them one after another about him.\"\\n And what, said the tiger-lily?\"\\n\"Hark, do you hear the drum?\"\\n-\\'turn, turn,\\'- there  are only two notes, always, \\'turn, turn.\\'Listen to the women\\'s song of mourning!\"\\nHear  the cry of the priest!\"\\nInher long red robe stands the Hindoo widow by the funeral  pile.\"\\nTheflames rise around her as she places herself on the dead body of herhusband;  but the Hindoo woman is thinking of the living one in thatcircle; of him, her son,  who lighted those flames.\"\\nThose shiningeyes trouble her heart more painfully than  the flames which willsoon consume her body to ashes.\"\\nCan the fire of the heart  beextinguished in the flames of the funeral pile?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t understand that at all,\" said little Gerda.\"\\n \"That is my story,\" said the tiger-lily.\"\\n What, says the convolvulus?\"\\n\"Near yonder narrow road stands an oldknight\\'s castle;  thick ivy creeps over the old ruined walls, leaf overleaf, even to the balcony, in  which stands a beautiful maiden.\"\\nShebends over the balustrades, and looks up the road.\"\\n No rose on its stemis fresher than she; no apple-blossom, wafted by the wind, floats  morelightly than she moves.\"\\nHer rich silk rustles as she bends over andexclaims, \\'Will  he not come?\\'  \"Is it Kay you mean?\"\\n asked Gerda.\"\\n \"I am only speaking of a story of my dream,\" replied the flower.\"\\n What, said the little snow-drop?\"\\n\"Between two trees a rope ishanging; there is a piece  of board upon it; it is a swing.\"\\nTwopretty little girls, in dresses white as snow,  and with long greenribbons fluttering from their hats, are sitting upon it  swinging.Their brother who is taller than they are, stands in the swing; he hasone  arm round the rope, to steady himself; in one hand he holds alittle bowl, and in the  other a clay pipe; he is blowing bubbles.\"\\nAsthe swing goes on, the bubbles fly upward,  reflecting the mostbeautiful varying colors.\"\\nThe last still hangs from the bowl of  thepipe, and sways in the wind.\"\\nOn goes the swing; and then a littleblack dog comes  running up.\"\\nHe is almost as light as the bubble, andhe raises himself on his hind  legs, and wants to be taken into theswing; but it does not stop, and the dog falls;  then he barks and getsangry.\"\\nThe children stoop towards him, and the bubble bursts.\"\\n Aswinging plank, a light sparkling foam picture,- that is my story.\"\\n  \"It may be all very pretty what you are telling me,\" said littleGerda, \"but you speak  so mournfully, and you do not mention little Kayat all.\"\\n  What do the hyacinths say?\"\\n\"There were three beautiful sisters,fair and delicate.\"\\n The dress of one was red, of the second blue, andof the third pure white.\"\\nHand in  hand they danced in the brightmoonlight, by the calm lake; but they were human beings,  not fairyelves.\"\\nThe sweet fragrance attracted them, and they disappeared in thewood;  here the fragrance became stronger.\"\\nThree coffins, in whichlay the three beautiful  maidens, glided from the thickest part ofthe forest across the lake.\"\\nThe fire-flies  flew lightly over them,like little floating torches.\"\\nDo the dancing maidens sleep,  or arethey dead?\"\\nThe scent of the flower says that they are corpses.\"\\nTheevening bell  tolls their knell.\"\\n  \"You make me quite sorrowful,\" said little Gerda; \"your perfume isso strong, you make  me think of the dead maidens.\"\\nAh!\"\\nis little Kayreally dead then?\"\\nThe roses have been  in the earth, and they say no.\"\\n  \"Cling, clang,\" tolled the hyacinth bells.\"\\n\"We are not tolling forlittle Kay; we do  not know him.\"\\nWe sing our song, the only one weknow.\"\\n  Then Gerda went to the buttercups that were glittering amongst thebright green leaves.\"\\n \"You are little bright suns,\" said Gerda; \"tell me if you knowwhere I can find my  play-fellow.\"\\n  And the buttercups sparkled gayly, and looked again at Gerda.\"\\nWhatsong could the  buttercups sing?\"\\nIt was not about Kay.\"\\n \"The bright warm sun shone on a little court, on the first warmday of spring.\"\\nHis  bright beams rested on the white walls of theneighboring house; and close by bloomed  the first yellow flower of theseason, glittering like gold in the sun\\'s warm ray.\"\\n An old woman satin her arm chair at the house door, and her granddaughter, a poorand  pretty servant-maid came to see her for a short visit.\"\\nWhen shekissed her grandmother  there was gold everywhere: the gold of theheart in that holy kiss; it was a golden  morning; there was gold inthe beaming sunlight, gold in the leaves of the lowly flower,  and onthe lips of the maiden.\"\\nThere, that is my story,\" said the buttercup.\"\\n \"My poor old grandmother!\"\\n sighed Gerda; \"she is longing to seeme, and grieving for  me as she did for little Kay; but I shall soon gohome now, and take little Kay with  me.\"\\nIt is no use asking theflowers; they know only their own songs, and can give me  noinformation.\"\\n  And then she tucked up her little dress, that she might runfaster, but the narcissus  caught her by the leg as she was jumpingover it; so she stopped and looked at the  tall yellow flower, andsaid, \"Perhaps you may know something.\"\\n  Then she stooped down quite close to the flower, and listened; andwhat did he say?\"\\n \"I can see myself, I can see myself,\" said the narcissus.\"\\n\"Oh, howsweet is my perfume!\"\\n Up in a little room with a bow window, stands alittle dancing girl, half undressed;  she stands sometimes on oneleg, and sometimes on both, and looks as if she would tread  thewhole world under her feet.\"\\nShe is nothing but a delusion.\"\\nShe ispouring water  out of a tea-pot on a piece of stuff which she holdsin her hand; it is her bodice.\"\\n \\'Cleanliness is a good thing,\\' shesays.\"\\nHer white dress hangs on a peg; it has also  been washed in thetea-pot, and dried on the roof.\"\\nShe puts it on, and ties  asaffron-colored handkerchief round her neck, which makes the dresslook whiter.\"\\nSee  how she stretches out her legs, as if she wereshowing off on a stem.\"\\nI can see myself,  I can see myself.\"\\n  \"What do I care for all that,\" said Gerda, \"you need not tell mesuch stuff.\"\\n And then  she ran to the other end of the garden.\"\\nThe doorwas fastened, but she pressed against  the rusty latch, and it gaveway.\"\\nThe door sprang open, and little Gerda ran out with  bare feetinto the wide world.\"\\nShe looked back three times, but no one seemed tobe  following her.\"\\nAt last she could run no longer, so she sat downto rest on a great  stone, and when she looked round she saw that thesummer was over, and autumn very  far advanced.\"\\nShe had known nothingof this in the beautiful garden, where the sun  shone and the flowersgrew all the year round.\"\\n \"Oh, how I have wasted my time?\"\\n said little Gerda; \"it is autumn.I must not rest  any longer,\" and she rose up to go on.\"\\nBut herlittle feet were wounded and sore, and  everything around her looked socold and bleak.\"\\nThe long willow-leaves were quite  yellow.\"\\nThedew-drops fell like water, leaf after leaf dropped from the trees,  thesloe-thorn alone still bore fruit, but the sloes were sour, and setthe teeth on  edge.\"\\nOh, how dark and weary the whole world appeared!\"\\n FOURTH STORY  THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS  Gerda was obliged to rest again, and just opposite the place whereshe sat, she saw  a great crow come hopping across the snow toward her.He stood looking at her for some  time, and then he wagged his head andsaid, \"Caw, caw; good-day, good-day.\"\\n He  pronounced the words asplainly as he could, because he meant to be kind to the little  girl;and then he asked her where she was going all alone in the wide world.\"\\n The word alone Gerda understood very well, and knew how much itexpressed.\"\\nSo then  she told the crow the whole story of her life andadventures, and asked him if he had  seen little Kay.\"\\n The crow nodded his head very gravely, and said, \"Perhaps Ihave- it may be.\"\\n  \"No!\"\\nDo you think you have?\"\\n cried little Gerda, and she kissedthe crow, and hugged  him almost to death with joy.\"\\n \"Gently, gently,\" said the crow.\"\\n\"I believe I know.\"\\nI think it maybe little Kay; but  he has certainly forgotten you by this time for theprincess.\"\\n  \"Does he live with a princess?\"\\n asked Gerda.\"\\n \"Yes, listen,\" replied the crow, \"but it is so difficult tospeak your language.\"\\nIf  you understand the crows\\' language then Ican explain it better.\"\\nDo you?\"\\n  \"No, I have never learnt it,\" said Gerda, but my grandmotherunderstands it, and used  to speak it to me.\"\\nI wish I had learnt it.\"\\n  \"It does not matter,\" answered the crow; \"I will explain as wellas I can, although  it will be very badly done;\" and he told her whathe had heard.\"\\n\"In this kingdom where  we now are,\" said he, \"therelives a princess, who is so wonderfully clever that she  has read allthe newspapers in the world, and forgotten them too, although she isso  clever.\"\\nA short time ago, as she was sitting on her throne, whichpeople say is not  such an agreeable seat as is often supposed, shebegan to sing a song which commences  in these words:  \\'Why should I not be married?\\'\\'Why not indeed?\\' said she, and so she determined  to marry if shecould find a husband who knew what to say when he was spoken to, andnot  one who could only look grand, for that was so tiresome.\"\\nThenshe assembled all her  court ladies together at the beat of the drum,and when they heard of her intentions  they were very much pleased.\"\\n\\'Weare so glad to hear it,\\' said they, we were talking  about it ourselvesthe other day.\\' You may believe that every word I tell you is  true,\"said the crow, \"for I have a tame sweetheart who goes freely about thepalace,  and she told me all this.\"\\n  Of course his sweetheart was a crow, for \"birds of a feather flocktogether,\" and one  crow always chooses another crow.\"\\n \"Newspapers were published immediately, with a border of hearts,and the initials of  the princess among them.\"\\nThey gave notice thatevery young man who was handsome was  free to visit the castle andspeak with the princess; and those who could reply loud  enough to beheard when spoken to, were to make themselves quite at home at thepalace;  but the one who spoke best would be chosen as a husband forthe princess.\"\\nYes, yes,  you may believe me, it is all as true as I sithere,\" said the crow.\"\\n\"The people came  in crowds.\"\\nThere was a greatdeal of crushing and running about, but no one succeeded  either on thefirst or second day.\"\\nThey could all speak very well while they wereoutside  in the streets, but when they entered the palace gates, andsaw the guards in silver  uniforms, and the footmen in their goldenlivery on the staircase, and the great halls  lighted up, they becamequite confused.\"\\nAnd when they stood before the throne on which  theprincess sat, they could do nothing but repeat the last words shehad said; and  she had no particular wish to hear her own words overagain.\"\\nIt was just as if they  had all taken something to make themsleepy while they were in the palace, for they  did not recoverthemselves nor speak till they got back again into the street.\"\\nTherewas  quite a long line of them reaching from the town-gate to thepalace.\"\\nI went myself  to see them,\" said the crow.\"\\n\"They were hungryand thirsty, for at the palace they  did not get even a glass of water.Some of the wisest had taken a few slices of bread  and butter withthem, but they did not share it with their neighbors; they thoughtif  they went in to the princess looking hungry, there would be abetter chance for  themselves.\"\\n  \"But Kay!\"\\ntell me about little Kay!\"\\n said Gerda, \"was he amongstthe crowd?\"\\n  \"Stop a bit, we are just coming to him.\"\\nIt was on the third day,there came marching  cheerfully along to the palace a little personage,without horses or carriage, his  eyes sparkling like yours; he hadbeautiful long hair, but his clothes were very poor.\"\\n  \"That was Kay!\"\\n said Gerda joyfully.\"\\n\"Oh, then I have foundhim;\" and she clapped her  hands.\"\\n \"He had a little knapsack on his back,\" added the crow.\"\\n \"No, it must have been his sledge,\" said Gerda; \"for he wentaway with it.\"\\n  \"It may have been so,\" said the crow; \"I did not look at it veryclosely.\"\\nBut I know  from my tame sweetheart that he passed through thepalace gates, saw the guards in  their silver uniform, and the servantsin their liveries of gold on the stairs, but  he was not in the leastembarrassed.\"\\n\\'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs,\\'  hesaid.\"\\n\\'I prefer to go in.\"\\n The rooms were blazing with light.Councillors and  ambassadors walked about with bare feet, carryinggolden vessels; it was enough to  make any one feel serious.\"\\nHisboots creaked loudly as he walked, and yet he was not  at all uneasy.\"\\n  \"It must be Kay,\" said Gerda, \"I know he had new boots on, Ihave heard them creak  in grandmother\\'s room.\"\\n  \"They really did creak,\" said the crow, \"yet he went boldly upto the princess herself,  who was sitting on a pearl as large as aspinning wheel, and all the ladies of the  court were present withtheir maids, and all the cavaliers with their servants; and  each ofthe maids had another maid to wait upon her, and the cavaliers\\'servants had  their own servants, as well as a page each.\"\\nThey allstood in circles round the princess,  and the nearer they stood tothe door, the prouder they looked.\"\\nThe servants\\' pages,  who alwayswore slippers, could hardly be looked at, they held themselves up soproudly  by the door.\"\\n  \"It must be quite awful,\" said little Gerda, \"but did Kay winthe princess?\"\\n  \"If I had not been a crow,\" said he, \"I would have married hermyself, although I am  engaged.\"\\nHe spoke just as well as I do, when Ispeak the crows\\' language, so I heard  from my tame sweetheart.\"\\nHewas quite free and agreeable and said he had not come to  woo theprincess, but to hear her wisdom; and he was as pleased with her asshe was  with him.\"\\n  \"Oh, certainly that was Kay,\" said Gerda, \"he was so clever; hecould work mental  arithmetic and fractions.\"\\nOh, will you take me tothe palace?\"\\n  \"It is very easy to ask that,\" replied the crow, \"but how are weto manage it?\"\\nHowever,  I will speak about it to my tame sweetheart,and ask her advice; for I must tell you  it will be very difficult togain permission for a little girl like you to enter the  palace.\"\\n  \"Oh, yes; but I shall gain permission easily,\" said Gerda, \"forwhen Kay hears that  I am here, he will come out and fetch me inimmediately.\"\\n  \"Wait for me here by the palings,\" said the crow, wagging his headas he flew away.\"\\n It was late in the evening before the crow returned.\"\\n\"Caw, caw,\"he said, she sends  you greeting, and here is a little roll which shetook from the kitchen for you; there  is plenty of bread there, and shethinks you must be hungry.\"\\nIt is not possible for  you to enter thepalace by the front entrance.\"\\nThe guards in silver uniform and  theservants in gold livery would not allow it.\"\\nBut do not cry, we willmanage to get  you in; my sweetheart knows a little back-staircase thatleads to the sleeping  apartments, and she knows where to find thekey.\"\\n  Then they went into the garden through the great avenue, where theleaves were falling  one after another, and they could see the light inthe palace being put out in the  same manner.\"\\nAnd the crow led littleGerda to the back door, which stood ajar.\"\\nOh!\"\\n how little Gerda\\'s heartbeat with anxiety and longing; it was just as if she were  going todo something wrong, and yet she only wanted to know where little Kaywas.\"\\n\"It  must be he,\" she thought, \"with those clear eyes, and thatlong hair.\"\\n She could fancy  she saw him smiling at her, as he usedto at home, when they sat among the roses.\"\\nHe  would certainly beglad to see her, and to hear what a long distance she had come for  hissake, and to know how sorry they had been at home because he did notcome back.\"\\n Oh what joy and yet fear she felt!\"\\nThey were now on thestairs, and in a small closet  at the top a lamp was burning.\"\\nIn themiddle of the floor stood the tame crow, turning  her head from side toside, and gazing at Gerda, who curtseyed as her grandmother had  taughther to do.\"\\n \"My betrothed has spoken so very highly of you, my little lady,\"said the tame crow,  \"your life-history, Vita, as it may be called,is very touching.\"\\nIf you will take the  lamp I will walk before you.\"\\nWewill go straight along this way, then we shall meet  no one.\"\\n  \"It seems to me as if somebody were behind us,\" said Gerda, assomething rushed by  her like a shadow on the wall, and then horseswith flying manes and thin legs, hunters,  ladies and gentlemen onhorseback, glided by her, like shadows on the wall.\"\\n \"They are only dreams,\" said the crow, \"they are coming to fetchthe thoughts of the  great people out hunting.\"\\n  \"All the better, for we shall be able to look at them in theirbeds more safely.\"\\nI  hope that when you rise to honor and favor, youwill show a grateful heart.\"\\n  \"You may be quite sure of that,\" said the crow from the forest.\"\\n They now came into the first hall, the walls of which were hungwith rose-colored satin,  embroidered with artificial flowers.\"\\nHere thedreams again flitted by them but so  quickly that Gerda could notdistinguish the royal persons.\"\\nEach hall appeared more  splendid thanthe last, it was enought to bewilder any one.\"\\nAt length they reached  abedroom.\"\\nThe ceiling was like a great palm-tree, with glass leavesof the most costly  crystal, and over the centre of the floor two beds,each resembling a lily, hung from  a stem of gold.\"\\nOne, in which theprincess lay, was white, the other was red; and in  this Gerda had toseek for little Kay.\"\\nShe pushed one of the red leaves aside, and  saw alittle brown neck.\"\\nOh, that must be Kay!\"\\nShe called his name out quiteloud, and  held the lamp over him.\"\\nThe dreams rushed back into the roomon horseback.\"\\nHe woke,  and turned his head round, it was not littleKay!\"\\nThe prince was only like him in the  neck, still he was youngand pretty.\"\\nThen the princess peeped out of her white-lily  bed, andasked what was the matter.\"\\nThen little Gerda wept and told herstory, and all  that the crows had done to help her.\"\\n \"You poor child,\" said the prince and princess; then theypraised the crows, and said  they were not angry for what they haddone, but that it must not happen again, and  this time they shouldbe rewarded.\"\\n \"Would you like to have your freedom?\"\\n asked the princess, \"orwould you prefer to  be raised to the position of court crows, with allthat is left in the kitchen for  yourselves?\"\\n  Then both the crows bowed, and begged to have a fixed appointment,for they thought  of their old age, and said it would be so comfortableto feel that they had provision  for their old days, as they called it.And then the prince got out of his bed, and  gave it up to Gerda,- hecould do no more; and she lay down.\"\\nShe folded her little  hands, andthought, \"How good everyone is to me, men and animals too;\" then sheclosed  her eyes and fell into a sweet sleep.\"\\nAll the dreams cameflying back again to her,  and they looked like angels, and one of themdrew a little sledge, on which sat Kay,  and nodded to her.\"\\nBut allthis was only a dream, and vanished as soon as she awoke.\"\\n The following day she was dressed from head to foot in silk andvelvet, and they invited  her to stay at the palace for a few days, andenjoy herself, but she only begged for  a pair of boots, and a littlecarriage, and a horse to draw it, so that she might go  into the wideworld to seek for Kay.\"\\nAnd she obtained, not only boots, but also amuff,  and she was neatly dressed; and when she was ready to go, there,at the door, she found  a coach made of pure gold, with thecoat-of-arms of the prince and princess shining  upon it like a star,and the coachman, footman, and outriders all wearing golden  crownson their heads.\"\\nThe prince and princess themselves helped her into thecoach,  and wished her success.\"\\nThe forest crow, who was now married,accompanied her for the  first three miles; he sat by Gerda\\'s side,as he could not bear riding backwards.\"\\nThe  tame crow stood in thedoor-way flapping her wings.\"\\nShe could not go with them, because  shehad been suffering from headache ever since the new appointment, nodoubt from  eating too much.\"\\nThe coach was well stored with sweetcakes, and under the seat were  fruit and gingerbread nuts.\"\\nFarewell, farewell,\" cried the prince and princess, and  littleGerda wept, and the crow wept; and then, after a few miles, the crowalso said  \"Farewell,\" and this was the saddest parting.\"\\nHowever, heflew to a tree, and stood  flapping his black wings as long as he couldsee the coach, which glittered in the  bright sunshine.\"\\n FIFTH STORY  LITTLE ROBBER-GIRL  The coach drove on through a thick forest, where it lighted up theway like a torch,  and dazzled the eyes of some robbers, who couldnot bear to let it pass them unmolested.\"\\n \"It is gold!\"\\nit is gold!\"\\n cried they, rushing forward, and seizingthe horses.\"\\nThen  they struck the little jockeys, the coachman, and thefootman dead, and pulled little  Gerda out of the carriage.\"\\n \"She is fat and pretty, and she has been fed with the kernels ofnuts,\" said the old  robber-woman, who had a long beard and eyebrowsthat hung over her eyes.\"\\n\"She is as  good as a little lamb; how niceshe will taste!\"\\n and as she said this, she drew forth  a shining knife,that glittered horribly.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n screamed the old woman the same  moment;for her own daughter, who held her back, had bitten her in the ear.She was  a wild and naughty girl, and the mother called her an uglything, and had not time  to kill Gerda.\"\\n \"She shall play with me,\" said the little robber-girl; \"sheshall give me her muff  and her pretty dress, and sleep with me in mybed.\"\\n And then she bit her mother again,  and made her spring in theair, and jump about; and all the robbers laughed, and said,  \"See howshe is dancing with her young cub.\"\\n  \"I will have a ride in the coach,\" said the little robber-girl;and she would have  her own way; for she was so self-willed andobstinate.\"\\n She and Gerda seated themselves in the coach, and drove away, overstumps and stones,  into the depths of the forest.\"\\nThe littlerobber-girl was about the same size as Gerda,  but stronger; she hadbroader shoulders and a darker skin; her eyes were quite black,  andshe had a mournful look.\"\\nShe clasped little Gerda round the waist, andsaid,-  \"They shall not kill you as long as you don\\'t make us vexed withyou.\"\\nI suppose you  are a princess.\"\\n  \"No,\" said Gerda; and then she told her all her history, and howfond she was of little  Kay.\"\\n The robber-girl looked earnestly at her, nodded her head slightly,and said, \"They  sha\\'nt kill you, even if I do get angry with you;for I will do it myself.\"\\n And then  she wiped Gerda\\'s eyes, and stuckher own hands in the beautiful muff which was so  soft and warm.\"\\n The coach stopped in the courtyard of a robber\\'s castle, the wallsof which were cracked  from top to bottom.\"\\nRavens and crows flew in andout of the holes and crevices, while  great bulldogs, either of whichlooked as if it could swallow a man, were jumping about;  but they werenot allowed to bark.\"\\nIn the large and smoky hall a bright fire wasburning  on the stone floor.\"\\nThere was no chimney; so the smoke went upto the ceiling, and  found a way out for itself.\"\\nSoup was boiling ina large cauldron, and hares and rabbits  were roasting on the spit.\"\\n \"You shall sleep with me and all my little animals to-night,\" saidthe robber-girl,  after they had had something to eat and drink.\"\\nSo shetook Gerda to a corner of the  hall, where some straw and carpetswere laid down.\"\\nAbove them, on laths and perches,  were more than ahundred pigeons, who all seemed to be asleep, although they  movedslightly when the two little girls came near them.\"\\n\"These all belongto me,\" said  the robber-girl; and she seized the nearest to her,held it by the feet, and shook  it till it flapped its wings.\"\\n\"Kissit,\" cried she, flapping it in Gerda\\'s face.\"\\n\"There  sit thewood-pigeons,\" continued she, pointing to a number of laths and a cagewhich  had been fixed into the walls, near one of the openings.\"\\n\"Bothrascals would fly away  directly, if they were not closely locked up.And here is my old sweetheart \\'Ba;\\' and  she dragged out a reindeerby the horn; he wore a bright copper ring round his neck,  and was tiedup.\"\\n\"We are obliged to hold him tight too, or else he would run awayfrom  us also.\"\\nI tickle his neck every evening with my sharp knife,which frightens him very  much.\"\\n And then the robber-girl drew a longknife from a chink in the wall, and let  it slide gently over thereindeer\\'s neck.\"\\nThe poor animal began to kick, and the  littlerobber-girl laughed, and pulled down Gerda into bed with her.\"\\n \"Will you have that knife with you while you are asleep?\"\\n askedGerda, looking at it  in great fright.\"\\n \"I always sleep with the knife by me,\" said the robber-girl.\"\\n\"Noone knows what may  happen.\"\\nBut now tell me again all about little Kay,and why you went out into the world.\"\\n  Then Gerda repeated her story over again, while the wood-pigeonsin the cage over her  cooed, and the other pigeons slept.\"\\nThe littlerobber-girl put one arm across Gerda\\'s  neck, and held the knife in theother, and was soon fast asleep and snoring.\"\\nBut Gerda  could not closeher eyes at all; she knew not whether she was to live or die.\"\\nTherobbers  sat round the fire, singing and drinking, and the old womanstumbled about.\"\\nIt was  a terrible sight for a little girl to witness.\"\\n Then the wood-pigeons said, \"Coo, coo; we have seen little Kay.A white fowl carried  his sledge, and he sat in the carriage of theSnow Queen, which drove through the wood  while we were lying in ournest.\"\\nShe blew upon us, and all the young ones died excepting  ustwo.\"\\nCoo, coo.\"\\n  \"What are you saying up there?\"\\n cried Gerda.\"\\n\"Where was the SnowQueen going?\"\\nDo you  know anything about it?\"\\n  \"She was most likely travelling to Lapland, where there isalways snow and ice.\"\\nAsk  the reindeer that is fastened up there with arope.\"\\n  \"Yes, there is always snow and ice,\" said the reindeer; \"and it isa glorious place;  you can leap and run about freely on the sparklingice plains.\"\\nThe Snow Queen has her  summer tent there, but her strongcastle is at the North Pole, on an island called  Spitzbergen.\"\\n  \"Oh, Kay, little Kay!\"\\n sighed Gerda.\"\\n \"Lie still,\" said the robber-girl, \"or I shall run my knife intoyour body.\"\\n  In the morning Gerda told her all that the wood-pigeons hadsaid; and the little  robber-girl looked quite serious, and noddedher head, and said, \"That is all talk,  that is all talk.\"\\nDo you knowwhere Lapland is?\"\\n she asked the reindeer.\"\\n \"Who should know better than I do?\"\\n said the animal, while hiseyes sparkled.\"\\n\"I was  born and brought up there, and used to run aboutthe snow-covered plains.\"\\n  \"Now listen,\" said the robber-girl; \"all our men are gone away,-only mother is here,  and here she will stay; but at noon she alwaysdrinks out of a great bottle, and  afterwards sleeps for a littlewhile; and then, I\\'ll do something for you.\"\\n Then she  jumped out ofbed, clasped her mother round the neck, and pulled her by the beard,crying,  \"My own little nanny goat, good morning.\"\\n Then her motherfilliped her nose till it  was quite red; yet she did it all for love.\"\\n When the mother had drunk out of the bottle, and was gone tosleep, the little  robber-maiden went to the reindeer, and said, \"Ishould like very much to tickle your  neck a few times more with myknife, for it makes you look so funny; but never mind,-  I will untieyour cord, and set you free, so that you may run away to Lapland;but you  must make good use of your legs, and carry this littlemaiden to the castle of the  Snow Queen, where her play-fellow is.You have heard what she told me, for she spoke  loud enough, and youwere listening.\"\\n  Then the reindeer jumped for joy; and the little robber-girllifted Gerda on his back,  and had the forethought to tie her on, andeven to give her her own little cushion  to sit on.\"\\n \"Here are your fur boots for you,\" said she; \"for it will bevery cold; but I must  keep the muff; it is so pretty.\"\\nHowever, youshall not be frozen for the want of it;  here are my mother\\'s largewarm mittens; they will reach up to your elbows.\"\\nLet me  put them on.There, now your hands look just like my mother\\'s.\"\\n  But Gerda wept for joy.\"\\n \"I don\\'t like to see you fret,\" said the little robber-girl;\"you ought to look quite  happy now; and here are two loaves and a ham,so that you need not starve.\"\\n These were  fastened on the reindeer, andthen the little robber-maiden opened the door, coaxed  in all the greatdogs, and then cut the string with which the reindeer was fastened,with  her sharp knife, and said, \"Now run, but mind you take goodcare of the little girl.\"\\n  And then Gerda stretched out her hand,with the great mitten on it, towards the little  robber-girl, and said,\"Farewell,\" and away flew the reindeer, over stumps and  stones,through the great forest, over marshes and plains, as quickly as hecould.\"\\nThe  wolves howled, and the ravens screamed; while up in the skyquivered red lights like  flames of fire.\"\\n\"There are my old northernlights,\" said the reindeer; \"see how they  flash.\"\\n And he ran on dayand night still faster and faster, but the loaves and the  ham were alleaten by the time they reached Lapland.\"\\n SIXTH STORY  THE LAPLAND WOMAN AND  THE FINLAND WOMAN  They stopped at a little hut; it was very mean looking; the roofsloped nearly down  to the ground, and the door was so low that thefamily had to creep in on their hands  and knees, when they went in andout.\"\\nThere was no one at home but an old Lapland woman,  who wascooking fish by the light of a train-oil lamp.\"\\nThe reindeer told herall about  Gerda\\'s story, after having first told his own, which seemedto him the most important,  but Gerda was so pinched with the cold thatshe could not speak.\"\\n\"Oh, you poor things,\"  said the Lapland woman,\"you have a long way to go yet.\"\\nYou must travel more than a  hundredmiles farther, to Finland.\"\\nThe Snow Queen lives there now, and sheburns Bengal  lights every evening.\"\\nI will write a few words on a driedstock-fish, for I have no  paper, and you can take it from me to theFinland woman who lives there; she can give  you better informationthan I can.\"\\n So when Gerda was warmed, and had taken something  toeat and drink, the woman wrote a few words on the dried fish, and toldGerda to take  great care of it.\"\\nThen she tied her again on thereindeer, and he set off at full speed.\"\\n Flash, flash, went thebeautiful blue northern lights in the air the whole night long.\"\\n And atlength they reached Finland, and knocked at the chimney of the Finlandwoman\\'s  hut, for it had no door above the ground.\"\\nThey crept in, butit was so terribly hot  inside that that woman wore scarcely anyclothes; she was small and very dirty looking.\"\\n She loosened littleGerda\\'s dress, and took off the fur boots and the mittens, or  Gerdawould have been unable to bear the heat; and then she placed a pieceof ice on  the reindeer\\'s head, and read what was written on thedried fish.\"\\nAfter she had read  it three times, she knew it by heart,so she popped the fish into the soup saucepan,  as she knew it was goodto eat, and she never wasted anything.\"\\nThe reindeer told his  own storyfirst, and then little Gerda\\'s, and the Finlander twinkled with herclever  eyes, but she said nothing.\"\\n\"You are so clever,\" said thereindeer; \"I know you can  tie all the winds of the world with apiece of twine.\"\\nIf a sailor unties one knot,  he has a fair wind;when he unties the second, it blows hard; but if the third andfourth  are loosened, then comes a storm, which will root up wholeforests.\"\\nCannot you give  this little maiden something which willmake her as strong as twelve men, to overcome  the Snow Queen?\"\\n  \"The Power of twelve men!\"\\n said the Finland woman; \"that wouldbe of very little use.\"\\n  But she went to a shelf and took down andunrolled a large skin, on which were inscribed  wonderful characters,and she read till the perspiration ran down from her forehead.\"\\n But thereindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked at theFinland woman  with such beseeching tearful eyes, that her own eyesbegan to twinkle again; so she  drew the reindeer into a corner, andwhispered to him while she laid a fresh piece  of ice on his head,\"Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen, but he finds  everythingthere so much to his taste and his liking, that he believes it isthe finest  place in the world; but this is because he has a piece ofbroken glass in his heart,  and a little piece of glass in his eye.These must be taken out, or he will never be  a human being again,and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.\"\\n  \"But can you not give little Gerda something to help her toconquer this power?\"\\n  \"I can give her no greater power than she has already,\" said thewoman; \"don\\'t you  see how strong that is?\"\\nHow men and animals areobliged to serve her, and how well  she has got through the world,barefooted as she is.\"\\nShe cannot receive any power from  me greaterthan she now has, which consists in her own purity and innocence ofheart.\"\\n If she cannot herself obtain access to the Snow Queen, andremove the glass fragments  from little Kay, we can do nothing tohelp her.\"\\nTwo miles from here the Snow Queen\\'s  garden begins; youcan carry the little girl so far, and set her down by the large  bushwhich stands in the snow, covered with red berries.\"\\nDo not staygossiping, but  come back here as quickly as you can.\"\\n Then the Finlandwoman lifted little Gerda upon  the reindeer, and he ran away withher as quickly as he could.\"\\n \"Oh, I have forgotten my boots and my mittens,\" cried littleGerda, as soon as she  felt the cutting cold, but the reindeer darednot stop, so he ran on till he reached  the bush with the redberries; here he set Gerda down, and he kissed her, and the  greatbright tears trickled over the animal\\'s cheeks; then he left her andran back  as fast as he could.\"\\n There stood poor Gerda, without shoes, without gloves, in themidst of cold, dreary,  ice-bound Finland.\"\\nShe ran forwards asquickly as she could, when a whole regiment  of snow-flakes cameround her; they did not, however, fall from the sky, which was  quiteclear and glittering with the northern lights.\"\\nThe snow-flakes ranalong the  ground, and the nearer they came to her, the larger theyappeared.\"\\nGerda remembered  how large and beautiful they looked throughthe burning-glass.\"\\nBut these were really  larger, and much moreterrible, for they were alive, and were the guards of the  SnowQueen, and had the strangest shapes.\"\\nSome were like greatporcupines, others like  twisted serpents with their heads stretchingout, and some few were like little fat  bears with their hair bristled;but all were dazzlingly white, and all were living  snow-flakes.\"\\nThenlittle Gerda repeated the Lord\\'s Prayer, and the cold was so  greatthat she could see her own breath come out of her mouth like steamas she uttered  the words.\"\\nThe steam appeared to increase, as shecontinued her prayer, till it took  the shape of little angels who grewlarger the moment they touched the earth.\"\\nThey  all wore helmets ontheir heads, and carried spears and shields.\"\\nTheir number continued  toincrease more and more; and by the time Gerda had finished herprayers, a whole legion  stood round her.\"\\nThey thrust their spears intothe terrible snow-flakes, so that they  shivered into a hundred pieces,and little Gerda could go forward with courage and  safety.\"\\nTheangels stroked her hands and feet, so that she felt the cold less, andshe  hastened on to the Snow Queen\\'s castle.\"\\n But now we must see what Kay is doing.\"\\nIn truth he thought notof little Gerda, and  never supposed she could be standing in the frontof the palace.\"\\n SEVENTH STORY  OF THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN  AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT LAST  The walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow, and thewindows and doors of the  cutting winds.\"\\nThere were more than a hundredrooms in it, all as if they had been  formed with snow blowntogether.\"\\nThe largest of them extended for several miles; they  wereall lighted up by the vivid light of the aurora, and they were solarge and empty,  so icy cold and glittering!\"\\nThere were noamusements here, not even a little bear\\'s  ball, when the storm mighthave been the music, and the bears could have danced on  their hindlegs, and shown their good manners.\"\\nThere were no pleasant games  ofsnap-dragon, or touch, or even a gossip over the tea-table, for theyoung-lady foxes.\"\\n Empty, vast, and cold were the halls of the SnowQueen.\"\\nThe flickering flame of the  northern lights could be plainlyseen, whether they rose high or low in the heavens,  from every part ofthe castle.\"\\nIn the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was  afrozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each pieceresembled another,  from being in itself perfect as a work of art,and in the centre of this lake sat the  Snow Queen, when she was athome.\"\\nShe called the lake \"The Mirror of Reason,\" and said  that it wasthe best, and indeed the only one in the world.\"\\n Little Kay was quite blue with cold, indeed almost black, but hedid not feel it; for  the Snow Queen had kissed away the icyshiverings, and his heart was already a lump  of ice.\"\\nHe dragged somesharp, flat pieces of ice to and fro, and placed them together  inall kinds of positions, as if he wished to make something out of them;just as we  try to form various figures with little tablets of woodwhich we call \"a Chinese  puzzle.\"\\n Kay\\'s fingers were very artistic; itwas the icy game of reason at which he  played, and in his eyes thefigures were very remarkable, and of the highest importance;  thisopinion was owing to the piece of glass still sticking in his eye.He composed  many complete figures, forming different words, butthere was one word he never could  manage to form, although he wishedit very much.\"\\nIt was the word \"Eternity.\"\\n The Snow  Queen had said tohim, \"When you can find out this, you shall be your own master, andI  will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates.\"\\n But hecould not accomplish  it.\"\\n \"Now I must hasten away to warmer countries,\" said the Snow Queen.\"\\nI will go and look  into the black craters of the tops of theburning mountains, Etna and Vesuvius, as  they are called,- I shallmake them look white, which will be good for them, and for  thelemons and the grapes.\"\\n And away flew the Snow Queen, leaving littleKay quite alone  in the great hall which was so many miles in length;so he sat and looked at his pieces  of ice, and was thinking so deeply,and sat so still, that any one might have supposed  he was frozen.\"\\n Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through thegreat door of the  castle.\"\\nCutting winds were raging around her, butshe offered up a prayer and the winds  sank down as if they weregoing to sleep; and she went on till she came to the large  empty hall,and caught sight of Kay; she knew him directly; she flew to him andthrew  her arms round his neck, and held him fast, while she exclaimed,\"Kay, dear little  Kay, I have found you at last.\"\\n  But he sat quite still, stiff and cold.\"\\n Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell on his breast, andpenetrated into his  heart, and thawed the lump of ice, and washed awaythe little piece of glass which  had stuck there.\"\\nThen he looked ather, and she sang-  \"Roses bloom and cease to be,  But we shall the Christ-child see.\"\\n  Then Kay burst into tears, and he wept so that the splinter ofglass swam out of his  eye.\"\\nThen he recognized Gerda, and said,joyfully, \"Gerda, dear little Gerda, where  have you been all thistime, and where have I been?\"\\n And he looked all around him,  andsaid, \"How cold it is, and how large and empty it all looks,\" and heclung to Gerda,  and she laughed and wept for joy.\"\\nIt was so pleasingto see them that the pieces of  ice even danced about; and when theywere tired and went to lie down, they formed  themselves into theletters of the word which the Snow Queen had said he must find  outbefore he could be his own master, and have the whole world and a pairof new skates.\"\\n Then Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became blooming;and she kissed his eyes, and  they shone like her own; she kissed hishands and his feet, and then he became quite  healthy and cheerful.\"\\nTheSnow Queen might come home now when she pleased, for there  stood hiscertainty of freedom, in the word she wanted, written in shiningletters of  ice.\"\\n Then they took each other by the hand, and went forth from thegreat palace of ice.\"\\n They spoke of the grandmother, and of the roseson the roof, and as they went on the  winds were at rest, and the sunburst forth.\"\\nWhen they arrived at the bush with red  berries, therestood the reindeer waiting for them, and he had brought anotheryoung  reindeer with him, whose udders were full, and the childrendrank her warm milk and  kissed her on the mouth.\"\\nThen they carried Kayand Gerda first to the Finland woman,  where they warmed themselvesthoroughly in the hot room, and she gave them directions  about theirjourney home.\"\\nNext they went to the Lapland woman, who had made somenew  clothes for them, and put their sleighs in order.\"\\nBoth thereindeer ran by their side,  and followed them as far as the boundariesof the country, where the first green leaves  were budding.\"\\nAnd herethey took leave of the two reindeer and the Lapland woman, and  allsaid- Farewell.\"\\nThen the birds began to twitter, and the forest toowas full of  green young leaves; and out of it came a beautifulhorse, which Gerda remembered, for  it was one which had drawn thegolden coach.\"\\nA young girl was riding upon it, with  a shining redcap on her head, and pistols in her belt.\"\\nIt was the littlerobber-maiden,  who had got tired of staying at home; she was goingfirst to the north, and if that  did not suit her, she meant to trysome other part of the world.\"\\nShe knew Gerda directly,  and Gerdaremembered her: it was a joyful meeting.\"\\n \"You are a fine fellow to go gadding about in this way,\" saidshe to little Kay, \"I  should like to know whether you deserve that anyone should go to the end of the world  to find you.\"\\n  But Gerda patted her cheeks, and asked after the prince andprincess.\"\\n \"They are gone to foreign countries,\" said the robber-girl.\"\\n \"And the crow?\"\\n asked Gerda.\"\\n \"Oh, the crow is dead,\" she replied; \"his tame sweetheart is now awidow, and wears  a bit of black worsted round her leg.\"\\nShe mourns verypitifully, but it is all stuff.\"\\n But now tell me how you managed to gethim back.\"\\n  Then Gerda and Kay told her all about it.\"\\n \"Snip, snap, snare!\"\\nit\\'s all right at last,\" said the robber-girl.\"\\n Then she took both their hands, and promised that if ever sheshould pass through the  town, she would call and pay them a visit.\"\\nAndthen she rode away into the wide world.\"\\n But Gerda and Kay wenthand-in-hand towards home; and as they advanced, spring  appearedmore lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful flowers.\"\\nVerysoon they  recognized the large town where they lived, and the tallsteeples of the churches,  in which the sweet bells were ringing amerry peal as they entered it, and found their  way to theirgrandmother\\'s door.\"\\nThey went upstairs into the little room, where  alllooked just as it used to do.\"\\nThe old clock was going \"tick, tick,\"and the hands  pointed to the time of day, but as they passed throughthe door into the room they  perceived that they were both grown up,and become a man and woman.\"\\nThe roses out on  the roof were in fullbloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little  chairs,on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seatedthemselves each  on their own chair, and held each other by the hand,while the cold empty grandeur  of the Snow Queen\\'s palace vanished fromtheir memories like a painful dream.\"\\nThe  grandmother sat in God\\'sbright sunshine, and she read aloud from the Bible, \"Except  yebecome as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into thekingdom of God.\"\\n And  Kay and Gerda looked into each other\\'s eyes,and all at once understood the words of  the old song,  \"Roses bloom and cease to be,  But we shall the Christ-child see.\"\\nAnd they both sat there, grown up, yet children  at heart; and it wassummer,- warm, beautiful summer.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE SNOWDROP  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT was winter-time; the air was cold, the wind was sharp, butwithin the closed doors  it was warm and comfortable, and within theclosed door lay the flower; it lay in the  bulb under thesnow-covered earth.\"\\n One day rain fell.\"\\nThe drops penetrated through the snowy coveringdown into the earth,  and touched the flower-bulb, and talked of thebright world above.\"\\nSoon the Sunbeam  pierced its way through thesnow to the root, and within the root there was a stirring.\"\\n \"Come in,\" said the flower.\"\\n \"I cannot,\" said the Sunbeam.\"\\n\"I am not strong enough to unlockthe door!\"\\nWhen the  summer comes I shall be strong!\"\\n  \"When will it be summer?\"\\n asked the Flower, and she repeatedthis question each time  a new sunbeam made its way down to her.\"\\nButthe summer was yet far distant.\"\\nThe snow  still lay upon the ground,and there was a coat of ice on the water every night.\"\\n \"What a long time it takes!\"\\nwhat a long time it takes!\"\\n said theFlower.\"\\n\"I feel a  stirring and striving within me; I must stretchmyself, I must unlock the door, I must  get out, and must nod a goodmorning to the summer, and what a happy time that will  be!\"\\n  And the Flower stirred and stretched itself within the thin rindwhich the water had  softened from without, and the snow and theearth had warmed, and the Sunbeam had  knocked at; and it shot forthunder the snow with a greenish-white blossom on a green  stalk, withnarrow thick leaves, which seemed to want to protect it.\"\\nThe snowwas cold,  but was pierced by the Sunbeam, therefore it was easy to getthrough it, and now the  Sunbeam came with greater strength thanbefore.\"\\n \"Welcome, welcome!\"\\n sang and sounded every ray, and the Flowerlifted itself up over  the snow into the brighter world.\"\\nThe Sunbeamscaressed and kissed it, so that it opened  altogether, white as snow,and ornamented with green stripes.\"\\nIt bent its head in joy  andhumility.\"\\n \"Beautiful Flower!\"\\n said the Sunbeams, \"how graceful anddelicate you are!\"\\nYou are  the first, you are the only one!\"\\nYou are ourlove!\"\\nYou are the bell that rings out  for summer, beautiful summer,over country and town.\"\\nAll the snow will melt; the cold  winds willbe driven away; we shall rule; all will become green, and then youwill have  companions, syringas, laburnums, and roses; but you arethe first, so graceful, so  delicate!\"\\n  That was a great pleasure.\"\\nIt seemed as if the air were singingand sounding, as if  rays of light were piercing through the leaves andthe stalks of the Flower.\"\\nThere  it stood, so delicate and so easilybroken, and yet so strong in its young beauty;  it stood there in itswhite dress with the green stripes, and made a summer.\"\\nBut there  was along time yet to the summer-time.\"\\nClouds hid the sun, and bleakwinds were blowing.\"\\n \"You have come too early,\" said Wind and Weather.\"\\n\"We have stillthe power, and you  shall feel it, and give it up to us.\"\\nYou shouldhave stayed quietly at home and not  have run out to make a displayof yourself.\"\\nYour time is not come yet!\"\\n  It was a cutting cold!\"\\nThe days which now come brought not asingle sunbeam.\"\\nIt was  weather that might break such a little Flowerin two with cold.\"\\nBut the Flower had  more strength than she herselfknew of.\"\\nShe was strong in joy and in faith in the summer,  which wouldbe sure to come, which had been announced by her deep longing andconfirmed  by the warm sunlight; and so she remained standing inconfidence in the snow in her  white garment, bending her head evenwhile the snow-flakes fell thick and heavy, and  the icy winds sweptover her.\"\\n \"You\\'ll break!\"\\n they said, \"and fade, and fade!\"\\nWhat did youwant out here?\"\\nWhy did  you let yourself be tempted?\"\\nThe Sunbeam onlymade game of you.\"\\nNow you have what you  deserve, you summer gauk.\"\\n \"Summer gauk!\"\\n she repeated in the cold morning hour.\"\\n \"O summer gauk!\"\\n cried some children rejoicingly; \"yonder standsone- how beautiful,  how beautiful!\"\\nThe first one, the only one!\"\\n  These words did the Flower so much good, they seemed to her likewarm sunbeams.\"\\nIn  her joy the Flower did not even feel when it wasbroken off.\"\\nIt lay in a child\\'s hand,  and was kissed by a child\\'smouth, and carried into a warm room, and looked on by gentle  eyes, andput into water.\"\\nHow strengthening, how invigorating!\"\\nThe Flowerthought she  had suddenly come upon the summer.\"\\n The daughter of the house, a beautiful little girl, was confirmed,and she had a friend  who was confirmed, too.\"\\nHe was studying for anexamination for an appointment.\"\\n\"He  shall be my summer gauk,\" shesaid; and she took the delicate Flower and laid it in  a piece ofscented paper, on which verses were written, beginning with summergauk and  ending with summer gauk.\"\\n\"My friend, be a winter gauk.\"\\n Shehad twitted him with the  summer.\"\\nYes, all this was in the verses,and the paper was folded up like a letter,  and the Flower was foldedin the letter, too.\"\\nIt was dark around her, dark as in those  days whenshe lay hidden in the bulb.\"\\nThe Flower went forth on her journey,and lay  in the post-bag, and was pressed and crushed, which was not atall pleasant; but that  soon came to an end.\"\\n The journey was over; the letter was opened, and read by thedear friend.\"\\nHow pleased  he was!\"\\nHe kissed the letter, and it waslaid, with its enclosure of verses, in a box,  in which there were manybeautiful verses, but all of them without flowers; she was  thefirst, the only one, as the Sunbeams had called her; and it was apleasant thing  to think of that.\"\\n She had time enough, moreover, to think about it; she thought ofit while the summer  passed away, and the long winter went by, andthe summer came again, before she appeared  once more.\"\\nBut now theyoung man was not pleased at all.\"\\nHe took hold of the letter  veryroughly, and threw the verses away, so that the Flower fell on theground.\"\\nFlat  and faded she certainly was, but why should she be thrownon the ground?\"\\nStill, it  was better to be here than in the fire, wherethe verses and the paper were being burnt  to ashes.\"\\nWhat had happened?What happens so often:- the Flower had made a gauk of  him, that wasa jest; the girl had made a fool of him, that was no jest, she had,during  the summer, chosen another friend.\"\\n Next morning the sun shone in upon the little flattenedSnowdrop, that looked as if  it had been painted upon the floor.\"\\nTheservant girl, who was sweeping out the room,  picked it up, and laid itin one of the books which were upon the table, in the belief  that itmust have fallen out while the room was being arranged.\"\\nAgain theflower lay  among verses- printed verses- and they are better thanwritten ones- at least, more  money has been spent upon them.\"\\n And after this years went by.\"\\nThe book stood upon thebook-shelf, and then it was taken  up and somebody read out of it.\"\\nItwas a good book; verses and songs by the old Danish  poet, AmbrosiusStub, which are well worth reading.\"\\nThe man who was now reading thebook  turned over a page.\"\\n \"Why, there\\'s a flower!\"\\n he said; \"a snowdrop, a summer gauk, apoet gauk!\"\\nThat flower  must have been put in there with a meaning!Poor Ambrosius Stub!\"\\nhe was a summer fool  too, a poet fool; he cametoo early, before his time, and therefore he had to taste  the sharpwinds, and wander about as a guest from one noble landed proprietor toanother,  like a flower in a glass of water, a flower in rhymed verses!Summer fool, winter fool,  fun and folly- but the first, the only,the fresh young Danish poet of those days.\"\\n Yes, thou shalt remain as atoken in the book, thou little snowdrop: thou hast been  put there witha meaning.\"\\n  And so the Snowdrop was put back into the book, and felt equallyhonored and pleased  to know that it was a token in the glorious bookof songs, and that he who was the  first to sing and to write hadbeen also a snowdrop, had been a summer gauk, and had  been looked uponin the winter-time as a fool.\"\\nThe Flower understood this, in herway,  as we interpret everything in our way.\"\\n That is the story of the Snowdrop.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE STORKS  by Hans Christian Andersen  ON the last house in a little village the storks had built a nest,and the mother stork  sat in it with her four young ones, who stretchedout their necks and pointed their  black beaks, which had not yetturned red like those of the parent birds.\"\\nA little  way off, on theedge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright and stiff;  notliking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and stood on the other,so still that  it seemed almost as if he were carved in wood.\"\\n\"Itmust look very grand,\" thought he,  \"for my wife to have a sentryguarding her nest.\"\\nThey do not know that I am her husband;  they willthink I have been commanded to stand here, which is quitearistocratic;\" and  so he continued standing on one leg.\"\\n In the street below were a number of children at play, and whenthey caught sight of  the storks, one of the boldest amongst the boysbegan to sing a song about them, and  very soon he was joined by therest.\"\\nThese are the words of the song, but each only  sang what hecould remember of them in his own way.\"\\n \"Stork, stork, fly away,  Stand not on one leg, I pray,  See your wife is in her nest,  With her little ones at rest.\"\\n They will hang one,  And fry another;  They will shoot a third,  And roast his brother.\"\\n  \"Just hear what those boys are singing,\" said the young storks;\"they say we shall  be hanged and roasted.\"\\n  \"Never mind what they say; you need not listen,\" said themother.\"\\n\"They can do no harm.\"\\n  But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, andmocking at them, excepting  one of the boys whose name was Peter; hesaid it was a shame to make fun of animals,  and would not join withthem at all.\"\\nThe mother stork comforted her young ones, and  toldthem not to mind.\"\\n\"See,\" she said, \"How quiet your father stands,although he is  only on one leg.\"\\n  \"But we are very much frightened,\" said the young storks, and theydrew back their  heads into the nests.\"\\n The next day when the children were playing together, and sawthe storks, they sang  the song again-  \"They will hang one,  And roast another.\"\\n  \"Shall we be hanged and roasted?\"\\n asked the young storks.\"\\n \"No, certainly not,\" said the mother.\"\\n\"I will teach you to fly,and when you have learnt,  we will fly into the meadows, and pay avisit to the frogs, who will bow themselves  to us in the water, andcry \\'Croak, croak,\\' and then we shall eat them up; that will  be fun.\"\\n  \"And what next?\"\\n asked the young storks.\"\\n \"Then,\" replied the mother, \"all the storks in the country willassemble together,  and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so thatit is very important for every one  to know how to fly properly.\"\\nIfthey do not, the general will thrust them through with  his beak, andkill them.\"\\nTherefore you must take pains and learn, so as to beready  when the drilling begins.\"\\n  \"Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark!they are singing again.\"\\n  \"Listen to me, and not to them,\" said the mother stork.\"\\n\"After thegreat review is  over, we shall fly away to warm countries far fromhence, where there are mountains  and forests.\"\\nTo Egypt, where we shallsee three-cornered houses built of stone, with  pointed tops that reachnearly to the clouds.\"\\nThey are called Pyramids, and are older  than astork could imagine; and in that country, there is a river thatoverflows its  banks, and then goes back, leaving nothing but mire;there we can walk about, and eat  frogs in abundance.\"\\n  \"Oh, o- h!\"\\n cried the young storks.\"\\n \"Yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all daylong but eat, and while  we are so well off out there, in thiscountry there will not be a single green leaf  on the trees, and theweather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall  on theearth in little white rags.\"\\n The stork meant snow, but she could notexplain  it in any other way.\"\\n \"Will the naughty boys freeze and fall in pieces?\"\\n asked the youngstorks.\"\\n \"No, they will not freeze and fall into pieces,\" said themother, \"but they will be  very cold, and be obliged to sit all dayin a dark, gloomy room, while we shall be  flying about in foreignlands, where there are blooming flowers and warm sunshine.\"\\n  Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that they couldstand upright in  the nest and look about them.\"\\nThe father broughtthem, every day, beautiful frogs,  little snakes, and all kinds ofstork-dainties that he could find.\"\\nAnd then, how funny  it was to seethe tricks he would perform to amuse them.\"\\nHe would lay his head quiteround  over his tail, and clatter with his beak, as if it had been arattle; and then he would  tell them stories all about the marshesand fens.\"\\n \"Come,\" said the mother one day, \"Now you must learn to fly.\"\\nAnd all the four young  ones were obliged to come out on the top of theroof.\"\\nOh, how they tottered at first,  and were obliged to balancethemselves with their wings, or they would have fallen  to the groundbelow.\"\\n \"Look at me,\" said the mother, \"you must hold your heads in thisway, and place your  feet so.\"\\nOnce, twice, once, twice- that is it.\"\\nNowyou will be able to take care of  yourselves in the world.\"\\n  Then she flew a little distance from them, and the young ones madea spring to follow  her; but down they fell plump, for their bodieswere still too heavy.\"\\n \"I don\\'t want to fly,\" said one of the young storks, creeping backinto the nest.\"\\n\"I  don\\'t care about going to warm countries.\"\\n  \"Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes?\"\\nsaid the mother, \"or  till the boys comes to hang you, or to roastyou?- Well then, I\\'ll call them.\"\\n  \"Oh no, no,\" said the young stork, jumping out on the roof withthe others; and now  they were all attentive, and by the third daycould fly a little.\"\\nThen they began to  fancy they could soar, sothey tried to do so, resting on their wings, but they soon  foundthemselves falling, and had to flap their wings as quickly aspossible.\"\\nThe boys  came again in the street singing their song:-  \"Stork, stork, fly away.\"\\n  \"Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?\"\\n asked the youngstorks.\"\\n \"No; leave them alone,\" said the mother.\"\\n\"Listen to me; that ismuch more important.\"\\n Now then.\"\\nOne-two-three.\"\\nNow to the right.One-two-three.\"\\nNow to the left, round the  chimney.\"\\nThere now, that wasvery good.\"\\nThat last flap of the wings was so easy and  graceful,that I shall give you permission to fly with me to-morrow to themarshes.\"\\n There will be a number of very superior storks there withtheir families, and I expect  you to show them that my children are thebest brought up of any who may be present.\"\\n You must strut aboutproudly- it will look well and make you respected.\"\\n  \"But may we not punish those naughty boys?\"\\n asked the youngstorks.\"\\n \"No; let them scream away as much as they like.\"\\nYou can fly fromthem now up high amid  the clouds, and will be in the land of thepyramids when they are freezing, and have  not a green leaf on thetrees or an apple to eat.\"\\n  \"We will revenge ourselves,\" whispered the young storks to eachother, as they again  joined the exercising.\"\\n Of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song aboutthe storks, not one was  so determined to go on with it as he who firstbegan it.\"\\nYet he was a little fellow  not more than six years old.\"\\nTothe young storks he appeared at least a hundred, for  he was so muchbigger than their father and mother.\"\\nTo be sure, storks cannot beexpected  to know how old children and grown-up people are.\"\\nSo theydetermined to have their  revenge on this boy, because he began thesong first and would keep on with it.\"\\nThe  young storks were veryangry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their  motherwas obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until theday of  their departure.\"\\n \"We must see first, how you acquit yourselves at the grandreview,\" said she.\"\\n\"If you  get on badly there, the general will thrusthis beak through you, and you will be killed,  as the boys said, thoughnot exactly in the same manner.\"\\nSo we must wait and see.\"\\n  \"You shall see,\" said the young birds, and then they took suchpains and practised  so well every day, that at last it was quite apleasure to see them fly so lightly  and prettily.\"\\nAs soon as theautumn arrived, all the storks began to assemble together  beforetaking their departure for warm countries during the winter.\"\\nThenthe review  commenced.\"\\nThey flew over forests and villages to show whatthey could do, for they  had a long journey before them.\"\\nThe youngstorks performed their part so well that  they received a mark ofhonor, with frogs and snakes as a present.\"\\nThese presents were  thebest part of the affair, for they could eat the frogs and snakes,which they very  quickly did.\"\\n \"Now let us have our revenge,\" they cried.\"\\n \"Yes, certainly,\" cried the mother stork.\"\\n\"I have thought upon thebest way to be  revenged.\"\\nI know the pond in which all the littlechildren lie, waiting till the storks  come to take them to theirparents.\"\\nThe prettiest little babies lie there dreaming  more sweetlythan they will ever dream in the time to come.\"\\nAll parents are glad tohave  a little child, and children are so pleased with a little brotheror sister.\"\\nNow we  will fly to the pond and fetch a little baby foreach of the children who did not sing  that naughty song to make gameof the storks.\"\\n  \"But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall we doto him?\"\\n cried the  young storks.\"\\n \"There lies in the pond a little dead baby who has dreameditself to death,\" said the  mother.\"\\n\"We will take it to the naughtyboy, and he will cry because we have brought  him a little deadbrother.\"\\nBut you have not forgotten the good boy who said it was  ashame to laugh at animals: we will take him a little brother andsister too, because  he was good.\"\\nHe is called Peter, and you shall allbe called Peter in future.\"\\n  So they all did what their mother had arranged, and from that day,even till now, all  the storks have been called Peter.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE STORM SHAKES THE SHIELD  by Hans Christian Andersen  IN the old days, when grandpapa was quite a little boy, and ranabout in little red  breeches and a red coat, and a feather in his cap-for that\\'s the costume the little  boys wore in his time when they weredressed in their best- many things were very  different from whatthey are now.\"\\nThere was often a good deal of show in the streets\\ufffeshowthat we don\\'t see nowadays, because it has been abolished as tooold-fashioned.\"\\n Still, it is very interesting to hear grandfathertell about it.\"\\n It must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in thosedays, when the shoemaker  brought over the shield, when the court-housewas changed.\"\\nThe silken flag waved to  and fro, on the shield itselfa double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the youngest  ladscarried the \"welcome,\" and the chest of the workmen\\'s guild, and  theirshirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white ribbons; the elderones carried  drawn swords, each with a lemon stuck on its point.\"\\nTherewas a full band of music,  and the most splendid of all the instrumentswas the \"bird,\" as grandfather called  the big stick with thecrescent on the top, and all manner of dingle-dangles hanging  to it- aperfect Turkish clatter of music.\"\\nThe stick was lifted high in theair, and  swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzledone\\'s eyes when the sun  shone on all its glory of gold, and silver,and brass.\"\\n In front of the procession ran the Harlequin, dressed in clothesmade of all kinds  of colored patches artfully sewn together, with ablack face, and bells on his head  like a sledge horse.\"\\nHe beat thepeople with his bat, which made a great clattering  without hurtingthem, and the people would crowd together and fall back, only toadvance  again the next moment.\"\\nLittle boys and girls fell over theirown toes into the gutter,  old women dispensed digs with theirelbows, and looked sour, and took snuff.\"\\nOne  laughed, another chatted;the people thronged the windows and door-steps, and even  all theroofs.\"\\nThe sun shone; and although they had a little rain too, thatwas good  for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, theyonly thought what a blessing  it was for the country.\"\\n And what stories grandpapa could tell!\"\\nAs a little boy he had seenall these fine doings  in their greatest pomp.\"\\nThe oldest of thepolicemen used to make a speech from the  platform on which theshield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had  beenmade by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had concocted ittogether,  and they had first drunk a good bowl of punch, so that thespeech might turn out well.\"\\n And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shoutedmuch louder for the  Harlequin, when he appeared in front of theplatform, and made a grimace at them.\"\\n The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out ofspirit-glasses, which  they then flung among the crowd, by whom theywere caught up.\"\\nGrandfather was the  possessor of one of these glasses,which had been given him by a working mason, who  had managed tocatch it.\"\\nSuch a scene was really very pleasant; and the shield on thenew  court-house was hung with flowers and green wreaths.\"\\n \"One never forgets a feast like that, however old one may grow,\"said grandfather.\"\\n Nor did he forget it, though he saw many other grandspectacles in his time, and could  tell about them too; but it was mostpleasant of all to hear him tell about the shield  that was broughtin the town from the old to the new court-house.\"\\n Once, when he was a little boy, grandpapa had gone with hisparents to see this  festivity.\"\\nHe had never yet been in the metropolisof the country.\"\\nThere were so many  people in the streets, that hethought that the shield was being carried.\"\\nThere were  many shieldsto be seen; a hundred rooms might have been filled with pictures, ifthey  had been hung up inside and outside.\"\\nAt the tailor\\'s werepictures of all kinds of  clothing, to show that he could stitch uppeople from the coarsest to the finest; at  the tobaccomanufacturer\\'s were pictures of the most charming little boys,  smokingcigars, just as they do in reality; there were signs with paintedbutter, and  herring, clerical collars, and coffins, and inscriptionsand announcements into the  bargain.\"\\nA person could walk up and downfor a whole day through the streets, and tire  himself out with lookingat the pictures; and then he would know all about what people  lived inthe houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, asgrandfather  said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, toknow at once who the  inhabitants were.\"\\n And this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapacame to the town.\"\\nHe told  it me himself, and he hadn\\'t \"a rogue on hisback,\" as mother used to tell me he had  when he wanted to make mebelieve something outrageous, for now he looked quite  trustworthy.\"\\n The first night after he came to the town had been signalized bythe most terrible  gale ever recorded in the newspapers- a gale such asnone of the inhabitants had ever  before experienced.\"\\nThe air wasdark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell;  and awheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of theway.\"\\nThere was  a groaning in the air, and a howling and a shrieking,and altogether it was a terrible  storm.\"\\nThe water in the canal roseover the banks, for it did not know where to run.\"\\n The storm swept overthe town, carrying plenty of chimneys with it, and more than one  proudweathercock on a church tower had to bow, and has never got over itfrom that  time.\"\\n There was a kind of sentry-house, where dwelt the venerable oldsuperintendent of the  fire brigade, who always arrived with the lastengine.\"\\nThe storm would not leave this  little sentry-house alone,but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it  down thestreet; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door ofthe dirty  journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at thelast fire, but the sentry-house  thought nothing of that.\"\\n The barber\\'s shield, the great brazen dish, was carried away,and hurled straight into  the embrasure of the councillor of justice;and the whole neighborhood said this looked  almost like malice,inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the councillor\\'s  wife,used to call that lady \"the Razor\" for she was so sharp that sheknew more about  other people\\'s business than they knew about itthemselves.\"\\n A shield with a dried salt fish painted on it flew exactly infront of the door of  a house where dwelt a man who wrote anewspaper.\"\\nThat was a very poor joke perpetrated  by the gale, whichseemed to have forgotten that a man who writes in a paper is not  thekind of person to understand any liberty taken with him; for he is aking in his  own newspaper, and likewise in his own opinion.\"\\n The weathercock flew to the opposite house, where he perched,looking the picture of  malice- so the neighbors said.\"\\n The cooper\\'s tub stuck itself up under the head of \"ladies\\'costumes.\"\\n  The eating-house keeper\\'s bill of fare, which had hung at his doorin a heavy frame,  was posted by the storm over the entrance to thetheatre, where nobody went.\"\\n\"It was  a ridiculous list- horse-radish,soup, and stuffed cabbage.\"\\n And now people came in  plenty.\"\\n The fox\\'s skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was foundfastened to the bell-pull  of a young man who always went to earlylecture, and looked like a furled umbrella.\"\\n He said he was strivingafter truth, and was considered by his aunt \"a model and an  example.\"\\n  The inscription \"Institution for Superior Education\" was foundnear the billiard club,  which place of resort was further adorned withthe words, \"Children brought up by  hand.\"\\n Now, this was not at allwitty; but, you see, the storm had done it, and no  one has any controlover that.\"\\n It was a terrible night, and in the morning- only think!- nearlyall the shields had  changed places.\"\\nIn some places the inscriptionswere so malicious, that grandfather  would not speak of them at all;but I saw that he was chuckling secretly, and there  may have been someinaccuracy in his description, after all.\"\\n The poor people in the town, and still more the strangers, werecontinually making  mistakes in the people they wanted to see; norwas this to be avoided, when they went  according to the shields thatwere hung up.\"\\nThus, for instance, some who wanted to  go to a verygrave assembly of elderly men, where important affairs were to bediscussed,  found themselves in a noisy boys\\' school, where all thecompany were leaping over the  chairs and tables.\"\\n There were also people who made a mistake between the church andthe theatre, and that  was terrible indeed!\"\\n Such a storm we have never witnessed in our day; for that onlyhappened in grandpapa\\'s  time, when he was quite a little boy.Perhaps we shall never experience a storm of  the kind, but ourgrandchildren may; and we can only hope and pray that all may stayat  home while the storm is moving the shields.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE STORY OF A MOTHER  by Hans Christian Andersen  A MOTHER sat by her little child; she was very sad, for she fearedit would die.\"\\nIt  was quite pale, and its little eyes were closed,and sometimes it drew a heavy deep  breath, almost like a sigh; andthen the mother gazed more sadly than ever on the poor  littlecreature.\"\\nSome one knocked at the door, and a poor old man walkedin.\"\\nHe was  wrapped in something that looked like a greathorse-cloth; and he required it truly  to keep him warm, for it wascold winter; the country everywhere lay covered with snow  and ice, andthe wind blew so sharply that it cut one\\'s face.\"\\nThe little childhad dozed  off to sleep for a moment, and the mother, seeing that theold man shivered with the  cold, rose and placed a small mug of beer onthe stove to warm for him.\"\\nThe old man  sat and rocked the cradle;and the mother seated herself on a chair near him, and looked  at hersick child who still breathed heavily, and took hold of its littlehand.\"\\n \"You think I shall keep him, do you not?\"\\n she said.\"\\n\"Ourall-merciful God will surely  not take him away from me.\"\\n  The old man, who was indeed Death himself, nodded his head in apeculiar manner, which  might have signified either Yes, or No; and themother cast down her eyes, while the  tears rolled down her cheeks.Then her head became heavy, for she had not closed her  eyes forthree days and nights, and she slept, but only for a moment.\"\\nShiveringwith  cold, she started up and looked round the room.\"\\nThe old man wasgone, and her child\\ufffeit was gone too!- the old man had taken it withhim.\"\\nIn the corner of the room the  old clock began to strike;\"whirr\" went the chains, the heavy weight sank to the ground,  andthe clock stopped; and the poor mother rushed out of the house callingfor her child.\"\\n Out in the snow sat a woman in long black garments, andshe said to the mother, \"Death  has been with you in your room.\"\\nI sawhim hastening away with your little child; he  strides faster thanthe wind, and never brings back what he has taken away.\"\\n  \"Only tell me which way he has gone,\" said the mother; tell me theway, I will find  him.\"\\n  \"I know the way,\" said the woman in the black garments; \"butbefore I tell you, you  must sing to me all the songs that you havesung to your child; I love these songs,  I have heard them before.\"\\nI amNight, and I saw your tears flow as you sang.\"\\n  \"I will sing them all to you,\" said the mother; \"but do not detainme now.\"\\nI must  overtake him, and find my child.\"\\n  But Night sat silent and still.\"\\nThen the mother wept and sang, andwrung her hands.\"\\n And there were many songs, and yet even more tears;till at length Night said, \"Go  to the right, into the dark forest offir-trees; for I saw Death take that road with  your little child.\"\\n  Within the wood the mother came to cross roads, and she knew notwhich to take.\"\\nJust  by stood a thorn-bush; it had neither leaf norflower, for it was the cold winter time,  and icicles hung on thebranches.\"\\n\"Have you not seen Death go by, with my little child?\"\\n  sheasked.\"\\n \"Yes,\" replied the thorn-bush; \"but I will not tell you whichway he has taken until  you have warmed me in your bosom.\"\\nI am freezingto death here, and turning to ice.\"\\n  Then she pressed the bramble to her bosom quite close, so thatit might be thawed,  and the thorns pierced her flesh, and greatdrops of blood flowed; but the bramble  shot forth fresh greenleaves, and they became flowers on the cold winter\\'s night,  so warm isthe heart of a sorrowing mother.\"\\nThen the bramble-bush told her thepath  she must take.\"\\nShe came at length to a great lake, on which therewas neither ship  nor boat to be seen.\"\\nThe lake was not frozensufficiently for her to pass over on the  ice, nor was it open enoughfor her to wade through; and yet she must cross it, if  she wished tofind her child.\"\\nThen she laid herself down to drink up the water ofthe  lake, which was of course impossible for any human being to do;but the bereaved mother  thought that perhaps a miracle might takeplace to help her.\"\\n\"You will never succeed  in this,\" said the lake;let us make an agreement together which will be better.\"\\nI  love tocollect pearls, and your eyes are the purest I have ever seen.\"\\nIfyou will weep  those eyes away in tears into my waters, then I willtake you to the large hothouse  where Death dwells and rears flowersand trees, every one of which is a human life.\"\\n  \"Oh, what would I not give to reach my child!\"\\n said the weepingmother; and as she  still continued to weep, her eyes fell into thedepths of the lake, and became two  costly pearls.\"\\n Then the lake lifted her up, and wafted her across to the oppositeshore as if she  were on a swing, where stood a wonderful building manymiles in length.\"\\nNo one could  tell whether it was a mountain coveredwith forests and full of caves, or whether it  had been built.\"\\nButthe poor mother could not see, for she had wept her eyes into thelake.\"\\n \"Where shall I find Death, who went away with my littlechild?\"\\n she asked.\"\\n \"He has not arrived here yet,\" said an old gray-haired woman,who was walking about,  and watering Death\\'s hothouse.\"\\n\"How have youfound your way here?\"\\nand who helped you?\"\\n  \"God has helped me,\" she replied.\"\\n\"He is merciful; will you not bemerciful too?\"\\nWhere  shall I find my little child?\"\\n  \"I did not know the child,\" said the old woman; \"and you areblind.\"\\nMany flowers and  trees have faded to-night, and Death will sooncome to transplant them.\"\\nYou know  already that every human being has alife-tree or a life-flower, just as may be ordained  for him.\"\\nThey looklike other plants; but they have hearts that beat.\"\\nChildren\\'s  heartsalso beat: from that you may perhaps be able to recognize yourchild.\"\\nBut what  will you give me, if I tell you what more you willhave to do?\"\\n \"I have nothing to give,\" said the afflicted mother; \"but Iwould go to the ends of  the earth for you.\"\\n  \"I can give you nothing to do for me there,\" said the old woman;\"but you can give  me your long black hair.\"\\nYou know yourself that itis beautiful, and it pleases me.\"\\n You can take my white hair inexchange, which will be something in return.\"\\n  \"Do you ask nothing more than that?\"\\n said she.\"\\n\"I will give itto you with pleasure.\"\\n  And she gave up her beautiful hair, and received in return thewhite locks of the old  woman.\"\\nThen they went into Death\\'s vasthothouse, where flowers and trees grew together  in wonderfulprofusion.\"\\nBlooming hyacinths, under glass bells, and peonies,  likestrong trees.\"\\nThere grew water-plants, some quite fresh, and otherslooking sickly,  which had water-snakes twining round them, and blackcrabs clinging to their stems.\"\\n There stood noble palm-trees, oaks, andplantains, and beneath them bloomed thyme and  parsley.\"\\nEach tree andflower had a name; each represented a human life, and belonged  tomen still living, some in China, others in Greenland, and in all partsof the world.\"\\n Some large trees had been planted in little pots, sothat they were cramped for room,  and seemed about to burst the potto pieces; while many weak little flowers were growing  in rich soil,with moss all around them, carefully tended and cared for.\"\\nThesorrowing  mother bent over the little plants, and heard the humanheart beating in each, and  recognized the beatings of her child\\'sheart among millions of others.\"\\n \"That is it,\" she cried, stretching out her hand towards alittle crocus-flower which  hung down its sickly head.\"\\n \"Do not touch the flower,\" exclaimed the old woman; \"but placeyourself here; and when  Death comes- I expect him every minute- do notlet him pull up that plant, but threaten  him that if he does youwill serve the other flowers in the same manner.\"\\nThis will  make himafraid; for he must account to God for each of them.\"\\nNone can beuprooted,  unless he receives permission to do so.\"\\n  There rushed through the hothouse a chill of icy coldness, and theblind mother felt  that Death had arrived.\"\\n \"How did you find your way hither?\"\\n asked he; \"how could youcome here faster than  I have?\"\\n  \"I am a mother,\" she answered.\"\\n And Death stretched out his hand towards the delicate littleflower; but she held her  hands tightly round it, and held it fast atsame time, with the most anxious care,  lest she should touch one ofthe leaves.\"\\nThen Death breathed upon her hands, and she  felt hisbreath colder than the icy wind, and her hands sank down powerless.\"\\n \"You cannot prevail against me,\" said Death.\"\\n \"But a God of mercy can,\" said she.\"\\n \"I only do His will,\" replied Death.\"\\n\"I am his gardener.\"\\nI takeall His flowers and  trees, and transplant them into the gardens ofParadise in an unknown land.\"\\nHow they  flourish there, and what thatgarden resembles, I may not tell you.\"\\n  \"Give me back my child,\" said the mother, weeping and imploring;and she seized two  beautiful flowers in her hands, and cried to Death,\"I will tear up all your flowers,  for I am in despair.\"\\n  \"Do not touch them,\" said Death.\"\\n\"You say you are unhappy; andwould you make another  mother as unhappy as yourself?\"\\n  \"Another mother!\"\\n cried the poor woman, setting the flowers freefrom her hands.\"\\n \"There are your eyes,\" said Death.\"\\n\"I fished them up out of thelake for you.\"\\nThey  were shining brightly; but I knew not they wereyours.\"\\nTake them back- they are clearer  now than before- and then lookinto the deep well which is close by here.\"\\nI will tell  you the namesof the two flowers which you wished to pull up; and you will see thewhole  future of the human beings they represent, and what you wereabout to frustrate and  destroy.\"\\n  Then she looked into the well; and it was a glorious sight tobehold how one of them  became a blessing to the world, and how muchhappiness and joy it spread around.\"\\nBut  she saw that the life of theother was full of care and poverty, misery and woe.\"\\n \"Both are the will of God,\" said Death.\"\\n \"Which is the unhappy flower, and which is the blessed one?\"\\n shesaid.\"\\n \"That I may not tell you,\" said Death; \"but thus far you maylearn, that one of the  two flowers represents your own child.\"\\nIt wasthe fate of your child that you saw,-  the future of your own child.\"\\n  Then the mother screamed aloud with terror, \"Which of them belongsto my child?\"\\nTell  me that.\"\\nDeliver the unhappy child.\"\\nRelease itfrom so much misery.\"\\nRather take it  away.\"\\nTake it to the kingdom ofGod.\"\\nForget my tears and my entreaties; forget all  that I have said ordone.\"\\n  \"I do not understand you,\" said Death.\"\\n\"Will you have your childback?\"\\nor shall I carry  him away to a place that you do not know?\"\\n  Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayedto God, \"Grant not my  prayers, when they are contrary to Thy will,which at all times must be the best.\"\\nOh,  hear them not;\" and herhead sank on her bosom.\"\\n Then Death carried away her child to the unknown land.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE STORY OF THE WIND  by Hans Christian Andersen  \"NEAR the shores of the great Belt, which is one of the straitsthat connect the  Cattegat with the Baltic, stands an old mansionwith thick red walls.\"\\nI know every  stone of it,\" says the Wind.\"\\n\"I sawit when it was part of the castle of Marck Stig  on the promontory.\"\\nButthe castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was  used againfor the walls of a new mansion on another spot- the baronial residenceof  Borreby, which still stands near the coast.\"\\nI knew them well, thosenoble lords and  ladies, the successive generations that dwelt there;and now I\\'m going to tell you  of Waldemar Daa and his daughters.\"\\nHowproud was his bearing, for he was of royal blood,  and could boast ofmore noble deeds than merely hunting the stag and emptying  thewine-cup.\"\\nHis rule was despotic: \\'It shall be,\\' he was accustomed tosay.\"\\nHis wife,  in garments embroidered with gold, stepped proudly overthe polished marble floors.\"\\n The tapestries were gorgeous, and thefurniture of costly and artistic taste.\"\\nShe had  brought gold and platewith her into the house.\"\\nThe cellars were full of wine.\"\\nBlack,  fieryhorses, neighed in the stables.\"\\nThere was a look of wealth about thehouse of  Borreby at that time.\"\\nThey had three children, daughters,fair and delicate maidens\\ufffeIda, Joanna, and Anna Dorothea; I havenever forgotten their names.\"\\nThey were a rich,  noble family, born inaffluence and nurtured in luxury.\"\\n \"Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!\"\\n roared the Wind, and went on, \"I did not seein this house, as  in other great houses, the high-born lady sittingamong her women, turning the  spinning-wheel.\"\\nShe could sweep thesounding chords of the guitar, and sing to the  music, not alwaysDanish melodies, but the songs of a strange land.\"\\nIt was \\'Live and  letlive,\\' here.\"\\nStranger guests came from far and near, music sounded,goblets clashed,  and I,\" said the Wind, \"was not able to drown thenoise.\"\\nOstentation, pride, splendor,  and display ruled, but not thefear of the Lord.\"\\n \"It was on the evening of the first day of May,\" the Windcontinued, \"I came from the  west, and had seen the ships overpoweredwith the waves, when all on board persisted  or were cast shipwreckedon the coast of Jutland.\"\\nI had hurried across the heath and  overJutland\\'s wood-girt eastern coast, and over the island of Funen, andthen I drove  across the great belt, sighing and moaning.\"\\nAt length Ilay down to rest on the shores  of Zeeland, near to the great houseof Borreby, where the splendid forest of oaks still  flourished.\"\\nTheyoung men of the neighborhood were collecting branches and  brushwoodunder the oak-trees.\"\\nThe largest and dryest they could find theycarried into  the village, and piled them up in a heap and set themon fire.\"\\nThen the men and maidens  danced, and sung in a circle roundthe blazing pile.\"\\nI lay quite quiet,\" said the Wind,  \"but I silentlytouched a branch which had been brought by one of the handsomest ofthe  young men, and the wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter thanall the rest.\"\\nThen  he was chosen as the chief, and received the nameof the Shepherd; and might choose  his lamb from among the maidens.There was greater mirth and rejoicing than I had ever  heard in thehalls of the rich baronial house.\"\\nThen the noble lady drove by towardsthe  baron\\'s mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded carriagedrawn by six horses.\"\\n The daughters were young and beautiful- threecharming blossoms- a rose, a lily, and  a white hyacinth.\"\\nThe motherwas a proud tulip, and never acknowledged the salutations  of any ofthe men or maidens who paused in their sport to do her honor.\"\\nThegracious  lady seemed like a flower that was rather stiff in the stalk.Rose, lily, and hyacinth\\ufffeyes, I saw them all three.\"\\nWhose littlelambs will they one day become?\"\\nthought I;  their shepherd will be agallant knight, perhaps a prince.\"\\nThe carriage rolled on,  and thepeasants resumed their dancing.\"\\nThey drove about the summer throughall the  villages near.\"\\nBut one night, when I rose again, the high-bornlady lay down to rise  again no more;

all the  people in the mansion wiped their eyes, but Lady Daa haddriven away, and I drove away  too,\" said the Wind.\"\\n\"Whir-r-r,whir-r-r-!\"\\n \"I returned again; I often returned and passed over the islandof Funen and the shores  of the Belt.\"\\nThen I rested by Borreby, nearthe glorious wood, where the heron made  his nest, the haunt of thewood-pigeons, the blue-birds, and the black stork.\"\\nIt was  yetspring, some were sitting on their eggs, others had already hatchedtheir young  broods; but how they fluttered about and cried out whenthe axe sounded through the  forest, blow upon blow!\"\\nThe trees of theforest were doomed.\"\\nWaldemar Daa wanted to  build a noble ship, aman-of-war, a three-decker, which the king would be sure to buy;  andthese, the trees of the wood, the landmark of the seamen, the refugeof the birds,  must be felled.\"\\nThe hawk started up and flew away, forits nest was destroyed; the  heron and all the birds of the forestbecame homeless, and flew about in fear and anger.\"\\n I could wellunderstand how they felt.\"\\nCrows and ravens croaked, as if in scorn,while  the trees were cracking and falling around them.\"\\nFar in theinterior of the wood, where  a noisy swarm of laborers were working,stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters,  and all were laughing atthe wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest,  AnnaDorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they madepreparations to fell  a tree that was almost dead, and on whose nakedbranches the black stork had built  her nest, she saw the poor littlethings stretching out their necks, and she begged  for mercy forthem, with the tears in her eyes.\"\\nSo the tree with the black stork\\'snest  was left standing; the tree itself, however, was not worth muchto speak of.\"\\nThen there  was a great deal of hewing and sawing, andat last the three-decker was built.\"\\nThe  builder was a man of loworigin, but possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead  spoke oflarge intellect, and Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to him, and sowas  Waldemar\\'s daughter Ida, the eldest, now about fifteen yearsold; and while he was  building the ship for the father, he wasbuilding for himself a castle in the air,  in which he and Ida wereto live when they were married.\"\\nThis might have happened,  indeed, ifthere had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and amoat.\"\\nBut  in spite of his clever head, the builder was still but apoor, inferior bird; and how  can a sparrow expect to be admittedinto the society of peacocks?\"\\n \"I passed on in my course,\" said the Wind, \"and he passed awayalso.\"\\nHe was not allowed  to remain, and little Ida got over it,because she was obliged to do so.\"\\nProud, black  horses, worth lookingat, were neighing in the stable.\"\\nAnd they were locked up; for  theadmiral, who had been sent by the king to inspect the new ship, andmake arrangements  for its purchase, was loud in admiration of thesebeautiful horses.\"\\nI heard it all,\"  said the Wind, \"for I accompaniedthe gentlemen through the open door of the stable,  and strewedstalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their feet.\"\\nWaldemar Daa wantedgold,  and the admiral wished for the proud black horses; thereforehe praised them so much.\"\\n But the hint was not taken, andconsequently the ship was not bought.\"\\nIt remained on  the shore coveredwith boards,- a Noah\\'s ark that never got to the water\\ufffeWhir-r-r-r-and that was a pity.\"\\n \"In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow, and thewater filled with large  blocks of ice which I had blown up to thecoast,\" continued the Wind, \"great flocks  of crows and ravens, darkand black as they usually are, came and alighted on the  lonely,deserted ship.\"\\nThen they croaked in harsh accents of the forest thatnow existed  no more, of the many pretty birds\\' nests destroyed and thelittle ones left without  a home; and all for the sake of that greatbit of lumber, that proud ship, that never  sailed forth.\"\\nI made thesnowflakes whirl till the snow lay like a great lake round  the ship,and drifted over it.\"\\nI let it hear my voice, that it might know whatthe storm  has to say.\"\\nCertainly I did my part towards teaching itseamanship.\"\\n \"That winter passed away, and another winter and summer bothpassed, as they are still  passing away, even as I pass away.\"\\nThesnow drifts onwards, the apple-blossoms are  scattered, the leavesfall,- everything passes away, and men are passing away too.\"\\n But thegreat man\\'s daughters are still young, and little Ida is a rose asfair to look  upon as on the day when the shipbuilder first saw her.I often tumbled her long, brown  hair, while she stood in the garden bythe apple-tree, musing, and not heeding how  I strewed the blossomson her hair, and dishevelled it; or sometimes, while she  stoodgazing at the red sun and the golden sky through the openingbranches of the dark,  thick foliage of the garden trees.\"\\nHer sisterJoanna was bright and slender as a lily;  she had a tall and loftycarriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather stiff  in back.She was very fond of walking through the great hall, where hung theportraits  of her ancestors.\"\\nThe women were represented in dresses ofvelvet and silk, with tiny  little hats, embroidered with pearls, ontheir braided hair.\"\\nThey were all handsome  women.\"\\nThe gentlemenappeared clad in steel, or in rich cloaks lined with squirrel\\'s  fur;they wore little ruffs, and swords at their sides.\"\\nWhere wouldJoanna\\'s place be  on that wall some day?\"\\nand how would he look,- hernoble lord and husband?\"\\nThis is  what she thought of, and often spokeof in a low voice to herself.\"\\nI heard it as I  swept into the longhall, and turned round to come out again.\"\\nAnna Dorothea, the  palehyacinth, a child of fourteen, was quiet and thoughtful; her large,deep, blue  eyes had a dreamy look, but a childlike smile stillplayed round her mouth.\"\\nI was not  able to blow it away, neither didI wish to do so.\"\\nWe have met in the garden, in the  hollow lane, in thefield and meadow, where she gathered herbs and flowers which  sheknew would be useful to her father in preparing the drugs and mixtureshe was always  concocting.\"\\nWaldemar Daa was arrogant and proud, buthe was also a learned man, and  knew a great deal.\"\\nIt was no secret,and many opinions were expressed on what he did.\"\\n In his fireplacethere was a fire, even in summer time.\"\\nHe would lock himself in hisroom,  and for days the fire would be kept burning; but he did not talkmuch of what he was  doing.\"\\nThe secret powers of nature are generallydiscovered in solitude, and did he  not soon expect to find out the artof making the greatest of all good things- the  art of making gold?So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked and the fire  crackledso constantly.\"\\nYes, I was there too,\" said the Wind.\"\\n\"\\'Leave italone,\\' I sang  down the chimney; \\'leave it alone, it will all end insmoke, air, coals, and ashes,  and you will burn your fingers.\\' ButWaldemar Daa did not leave it alone, and all he  possessed vanishedlike smoke blown by me.\"\\nThe splendid black horses, where are  they?What became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silvervessels in cupboards  and chests, and even the house and home itself?It was easy to melt all these away  in the gold-making crucible, andyet obtain no gold.\"\\nAnd so it was.\"\\nEmpty are the barns  andstore-rooms, the cellars and cupboards; the servants decreased innumber, and the  mice multiplied.\"\\nFirst one window became broken, andthen another, so that I could  get in at other places besides the door.\\'Where the chimney smokes, the meal is being  cooked,\\' says theproverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for  thesake of gold.\"\\nI blew round the courtyard,\" said the Wind, \"like awatchman blowing  his home, but no watchman was there.\"\\nI twirled theweather-cock round on the summit  of the tower, and it creaked like thesnoring of a warder, but no warder was there;  nothing but mice andrats.\"\\nPoverty laid the table-cloth; poverty sat in the wardrobe  and inthe larder.\"\\nThe door fell off its hinges, cracks and fissures madetheir  appearance everywhere; so that I could go in and out atpleasure, and that is how I  know all about it.\"\\nAmid smoke and ashes,sorrow, and sleepless nights, the hair and  beard of the master ofthe house turned gray, and deep furrows showed themselves around  histemples; his skin turned pale and yellow, while his eyes stilllooked eagerly for  gold, the longed-for gold, and the result of hislabor was debt instead of gain.\"\\nI  blew the smoke and ashes into hisface and beard;

I heard him praying, and Inoticed  how he held his breath.\"\\nThe lamp burnt out, but he did notobserve it.\"\\nI blew up the  fire in the coals on the hearth, and itthrew a red glow on his ghastly white face,  lighting it up with aglare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their  cavernousdepths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if theywould burst  from their sockets.\"\\n\\'Look at the alchymic glass,\\' hecried; \\'something glows in the  crucible, pure and heavy.\\' He lifted itwith a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice  of agitation, \\'Gold!gold!\\' He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down,\" said  theWind; \"but I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied himthrough the door  to the room where his daughter sat shivering.\"\\nHiscoat was powdered with ashes, and  there were ashes in his beard and inhis tangled hair.\"\\nHe stood erect, and held high  in the air the brittleglass that contained his costly treasure.\"\\n\\'Found!\"\\nfound!\"\\n Gold!gold!\\' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it mightflash in the  sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic glassfell from it, clattering to  the ground, and brake in a thousandpieces.\"\\nThe last bubble of his happiness had burst,  with a whiz anda whir, and I rushed away from the gold-maker\\'s house.\"\\n \"Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the mistsprinkled cold drops on  the berries and the leafless branches, Icame back in fresh spirits, rushed through  the air, swept the skyclear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no  greatlabor to do, yet it must be done.\"\\nThere was another kind of sweepingtaking place  at Waldemar Daa\\'s, in the castle of Borreby.\"\\nHis enemy,Owe Ramel, of Basnas, was there,  with the mortgage of the house andeverything it contained, in his pocket.\"\\nI rattled  the brokenwindows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled throughcracks and  crevices, so that Mr.\"\\nOwe Ramel did not much like to remainthere.\"\\nIda and Anna Dorothea  wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale andproud, biting her lips till the blood came;

I thought it would be so.\"\\n It was hard for any one to preservecomposure on such a day; but these people had strong  wills, asunbending as their hard fortune.\"\\nThere was nothing they could calltheir own,  excepting the clothes they wore.\"\\nYes, there was one thingmore, an alchymist\\'s glass,  a new one, which had been lately bought,and filled with what could be gathered from  the ground of the treasurewhich had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise.\"\\n WaldemarDaa hid the glass in his bosom, and, taking his stick in his hand, theonce  rich gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house ofBorreby.\"\\nI blew coldly  upon his flustered cheeks, I stroked his graybeard and his long white hair, and I  sang as well as I was able,\\'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r.\"\\nGone away!\"\\nGone away!\\' Ida walked  on one sideof the old man, and Anna Dorothea on the other; Joanna turned round,as  they left the entrance.\"\\nWhy?\"\\nFortune would not turn because sheturned.\"\\nShe looked  at the stone in the walls which had once formedpart of the castle of Marck Stig, and  perhaps she thought of hisdaughters and of the old song,-  \"The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand,  Went forth alone to a distant land.\"\\nThese were only two; here there were three, and  their father with themalso.\"\\nThey walked along the high-road, where once they had  driven intheir splendid carriage; they went forth with their father as beggars.They  wandered across an open field to a mud hut, which they rented fora dollar and a half  a year, a new home, with bare walls and emptycupboards.\"\\nCrows and magpies fluttered  about them, and cried, as if incontempt, \\'Caw, caw, turned out of our nest- caw, caw,\\'  as they haddone in the wood at Borreby, when the trees were felled.\"\\nDaa and  hisdaughters could not help hearing it, so I blew about their ears todrown the noise;  what use was it that they should listen?\"\\nSo they wentto live in the mud hut in the  open field, and I wandered away, overmoor and meadow, through bare bushes and leafless  forests, to the opensea, to the broad shores in other lands, \\'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!\"\\n Away,away!\\' year after year.\"\\n  And what became of Waldemar Daa and his daughters?\"\\nListen; theWind will tell us:  \"The last I saw of them was the pale hyacinth, Anna Dorothea.\"\\nShewas old and bent  then; for fifty years had passed and she had outlivedthem all.\"\\nShe could relate the  history.\"\\nYonder, on the heath, near thetown of Wiborg, in Jutland, stood the fine  new house of the canon.\"\\nItwas built of red brick, with projecting gables.\"\\nIt was  inhabited, forthe smoke curled up thickly from the chimneys.\"\\nThe canon\\'s gentle  ladyand her beautiful daughters sat in the bay-window, and looked over thehawthorn  hedge of the garden towards the brown heath.\"\\nWhat were theylooking at?\"\\nTheir glances  fell upon a stork\\'s nest, which was builtupon an old tumbledown hut.\"\\nThe roof, as  far as one existed at all,was covered with moss and lichen.\"\\nThe stork\\'s nest covered  the greaterpart of it, and that alone was in a good condition; for it was kept inorder  by the stork himself.\"\\nThat is a house to be looked at, and notto be touched,\" said  the Wind.\"\\n\"For the sake of the stork\\'s nest ithad been allowed to remain, although  it is a blot on the landscape.They did not like to drive the stork away; therefore  the old shed wasleft standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to stay.\"\\n Shehad the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it perchance herreward for having  once interceded for the preservation of the nest ofits black brother in the forest  of Borreby?\"\\nAt that time she, thepoor woman, was a young child, a white hyacinth in  a rich garden.\"\\nSheremembered that time well; for it was Anna Dorothea.\"\\n \"\\'O-h, o-h,\\' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning ofthe wind among the  reeds and rushes.\"\\n\\'O-h, o-h,\\' she would say, \\'nobell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar  Daa.\"\\nThe poor school-boys did noteven sing a psalm when the former lord of Borreby  was laid in theearth to rest.\"\\nO-h, everything has an end, even misery.\"\\nSister Idabecame  the wife of a peasant; that was the hardest trial whichbefell our father, that the  husband of his own daughter should be amiserable serf, whom his owner could place  for punishment on thewooden horse.\"\\nI suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida\\ufffealas!alas!\"\\nit is not ended yet; miserable that I am!\"\\nKind Heaven, grantme that I may  die.\\'  \"That was Anna Dorothea\\'s prayer in the wretched hut that was leftstanding for the  sake of the stork.\"\\nI took pity on the proudest of thesisters,\" said the Wind.\"\\n\"Her  courage was like that of a man; and inman\\'s clothes she served as a sailor on board  ship.\"\\nShe was of fewwords, and of a dark countenance; but she did not know how to  climb,so I blew her overboard before any one found out that she was a woman;and, in  my opinion, that was well done,\" said the Wind.\"\\n On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daaimagined he had discovered  the art of making gold, I heard the tonesof a psalm under the stork\\'s nest, and within  the crumbling walls.It was Anna Dorothea\\'s last song.\"\\nThere was no window in the hut,  onlya hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of burnished gold,and looked  through.\"\\nWith what splendor he filled that dismal dwelling!Her eyes were glazing,  and her heart breaking; but so it would havebeen, even had the sun not shone that  morning on Anna Dorothea.\"\\nThestork\\'s nest had secured her a home till her death.\"\\nI  sung over hergrave; I sung at her father\\'s grave.\"\\nI know where it lies, and whereher  grave is too, but nobody else knows it.\"\\n \"New times now; all is changed.\"\\nThe old high-road is lost amidcultivated fields; the  new one now winds along over covered graves;and soon the railway will come, with its  train of carriages, andrush over graves where lie those whose very names are forgoten.\"\\n Allpassed away, passed away!\"\\n \"This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters.\"\\nTell itbetter, any of you, if  you know how,\" said the Wind;

thewindows were plastered with snow on the  outside, snow fell in massesfrom the roofs.\"\\nEvery one seemed in a great hurry; they  ran, theyflew, fell into each other\\'s arms, holding fast for a moment as longas they  could stand safely.\"\\nCoaches and horses looked as if they hadbeen frosted with sugar.\"\\n The footmen stood with their backs againstthe carriages, so as to turn their faces  from the wind.\"\\nThe footpassengers kept within the shelter of the carriages, which  couldonly move slowly on in the deep snow.\"\\nAt last the storm abated, anda narrow path  was swept clean in front of the houses; when two personsmet in this path they stood  still, for neither liked to take the firststep on one side into the deep snow to let  the other pass him.\"\\nTherethey stood silent and motionless, till at last, as if by  tacitconsent, they each sacrificed a leg and buried it in the deep snow.Towards  evening, the weather became calm.\"\\nThe sky, cleared from thesnow, looked more lofty  and transparent, while the stars shone withnew brightness and purity.\"\\nThe frozen snow  crackled under foot, andwas quite firm enough to bear the sparrows, who hopped upon  it inthe morning dawn.\"\\nThey searched for food in the path which had beenswept, but  there was very little for them, and they were terriblycold.\"\\n\"Tweet, tweet,\" said one  to another; they call this a newyear, but I think it is worse than the last.\"\\nWe might  just as wellhave kept the old year; I\\'m quite unhappy, and I have a right to beso.\"\\n  \"Yes, you have; and yet the people ran about and fired off guns,to usher in the new  year,\" said a little shivering sparrow.\"\\n\"Theythrew things against the doors, and were  quite beside themselveswith joy, because the old year had disappeared.\"\\nI was glad  too, forI expected we should have some warm days, but my hopes have come tonothing.\"\\n It freezes harder than ever; I think mankind have made amistake in reckoning time.\"\\n  \"That they have,\" said a third, an old sparrow with a whitepoll; \"they have something  they call a calendar; it\\'s an inventionof their own, and everything must be arranged  according to it, butit won\\'t do.\"\\nWhen spring comes, then the year begins.\"\\nIt is  thevoice of nature, and I reckon by that.\"\\n  \"But when will spring come?\"\\n asked the others.\"\\n \"It will come when the stork returns, but he is very uncertain,and here in the town  no one knows anything about it.\"\\nIn the countrythey have more knowledge; shall we fly  away there and wait?\"\\nwe shallbe nearer to spring then, certainly.\"\\n  \"That may be all very well,\" said another sparrow, who had beenhopping about for a  long time, chirping, but not saying anything ofconsequence, \"but I have found a few  comforts here in town which,I\\'m afraid, I should miss out in the country.\"\\nHere in  thisneighborhood, there lives a family of people who have been so sensibleas to place  three or four flower-pots against the wall in thecourt-yard, so that the openings  are all turned inward, and the bottomof each points outward.\"\\nIn the latter a hole  has been cut large enoughfor me to fly in and out.\"\\nI and my husband have built a nest  in one ofthese pots, and all our young ones, who have now flown away, werebrought  up there.\"\\nThe people who live there of course made the wholearrangement that they  might have the pleasure of seeing us, or theywould not have done it.\"\\nIt pleased them  also to strew bread-crumbs forus, and so we have food, and may consider ourselves  provided for.\"\\nSo Ithink my husband and I will stay where we are; although we are notvery  happy, but we shall stay.\"\\n  \"And we will fly into the country,\" said the others, \"to see ifspring is coming.\"\\n  And away they flew.\"\\n In the country it was really winter, a few degrees colder thanin the town.\"\\nThe sharp  winds blew over the snow-covered fields.\"\\nThefarmer, wrapped in warm clothing, sat  in his sleigh, and beat his armsacross his chest to keep off the cold.\"\\nThe whip lay  on his lap.\"\\nThehorses ran till they smoked.\"\\nThe snow crackled, the sparrows  hoppedabout in the wheel-ruts, and shivered, crying, \"Tweet, tweet; whenwill spring  come?\"\\nIt is very long in coming.\"\\n  \"Very long indeed,\" sounded over the field, from the nearestsnow-covered hill.\"\\nIt  might have been the echo which people heard,or perhaps the words of that wonderful  old man, who sat high on a heapof snow, regardless of wind or weather.\"\\nHe was all  in white; he had ona peasant\\'s coarse white coat of frieze.\"\\nHe had long white hair,  apale face, and large clear blue eyes.\"\\n\"Who is that old man?\"\\n asked thesparrows.\"\\n \"I know who he is,\" said an old raven, who sat on the fence, andwas condescending  enough to acknowledge that we are all equal in thesight of Heaven, even as little  birds, and therefore he talked withthe sparrows, and gave them the information they  wanted.\"\\n\"I know whothe old man is,\" he said.\"\\n\"It is Winter, the old man of last year;he  is not dead yet, as the calendar says, but acts as guardian tolittle Prince Spring  who is coming.\"\\nWinter rules here still.\"\\nUgh!the cold makes you shiver, little ones,  does it not?\"\\n  \"There!\"\\nDid I not tell you so?\"\\n said the smallest of the sparrows.\"\\nThe calendar is  only an invention of man, and is not arrangedaccording to nature.\"\\nThey should leave  these things to us; we arecreated so much more clever than they are.\"\\n  One week passed, and then another.\"\\nThe forest looked dark, thehard-frozen lake lay  like a sheet of lead.\"\\nThe mountains haddisappeared, for over the land hung damp, icy  mists.\"\\nLarge black crowsflew about in silence; it was as if nature slept.\"\\nAt length  asunbeam glided over the lake, and it shone like burnished silver.But the snow on  the fields and the hills did not glitter as before.The white form of Winter sat there  still, with his un-wandering gazefixed on the south.\"\\nHe did not perceive that the  snowy carpet seemedto sink as it were into the earth; that here and there a littlegreen  patch of grass appeared, and that these patches were coveredwith sparrows.\"\\n \"Tee-wit, tee-wit; is spring coming at last?\"\\n  Spring!\"\\nHow the cry resounded over field and meadow, and throughthe dark-brown woods,  where the fresh green moss still gleamed onthe trunks of the trees, and from the south  came the two firststorks flying through the air, and on the back of each sat a  lovelylittle child, a boy and a girl.\"\\nThey greeted the earth with a kiss,and wherever  they placed their feet white flowers sprung up frombeneath the snow.\"\\nHand in hand  they approached the old ice-man,Winter, embraced him and clung to his breast; and  as they did so, in amoment all three were enveloped in a thick, damp mist, dark and  heavy,that closed over them like a veil.\"\\nThe wind arose with mighty rustlingtone,  and cleared away the mist.\"\\nThen the sun shone out warmly.\"\\nWinterhad vanished away,  and the beautiful children of Spring sat on thethrone of the year.\"\\n \"This is really a new year,\" cried all the sparrows, \"now we shallget our rights,  and have some return for what we suffered in winter.\"\\n  Wherever the two children wandered, green buds burst forth on bushand tree, the grass  grew higher, and the corn-fields became lovelyin delicate green.\"\\n The little maiden strewed flowers in her path.\"\\nShe held herapron before her: it was  full of flowers; it was as if they sprunginto life there, for the more she scattered  around her, the moreflowers did her apron contain.\"\\nEagerly she showered snowy  blossomsover apple and peach-trees, so that they stood in full beauty beforeeven their  green leaves had burst from the bud.\"\\nThen the boy and thegirl clapped their hands,  and troops of birds came flying by, no oneknew from whence, and they all twittered  and chirped, singing\"Spring has come!\"\\n How beautiful everything was!\"\\nMany an old dame  cameforth from her door into the sunshine, and shuffled about with greatdelight,  glancing at the golden flowers which glittered everywherein the fields, as they used  to do in her young days.\"\\nThe world grewyoung again to her, as she said, \"It is a blessed  time out hereto-day.\"\\n The forest already wore its dress of dark-green buds.\"\\nThethyme  blossomed in fresh fragrance.\"\\nPrimroses and anemones sprungforth, and violets bloomed  in the shade, while every blade of grasswas full of strength and sap.\"\\nWho could resist  sitting down on sucha beautiful carpet?\"\\nand then the young children of Spring  seatedthemselves, holding each other\\'s hands, and sang, and laughed, andgrew.\"\\nA  gentle rain fell upon them from the sky, but they did notnotice it, for the rain-drops  were their own tears of joy.\"\\nThey kissedeach other, and were betrothed; and in the  same moment the buds of thetrees unfolded, and when the sun rose, the forest was green.\"\\n Hand inhand the two wandered beneath the fresh pendant canopy of foliage,while the  sun\\'s rays gleamed through the opening of the shade, inchanging and varied colors.\"\\n The delicate young leaves filled the airwith refreshing odor.\"\\nMerrily rippled the  clear brooks and rivuletsbetween the green, velvety rushes, and over the many-colored  pebblesbeneath.\"\\nAll nature spoke of abundance and plenty.\"\\nThe cuckoo sang,and the  lark carolled, for it was now beautiful spring.\"\\nThe carefulwillows had, however,  covered their blossoms with woolly gloves; andthis carefulness is rather tedious.\"\\n Days and weeks went by, and theheat increased.\"\\nWarm air waved the corn as it grew  golden in thesun.\"\\nThe white northern lily spread its large green leaves over theglossy  mirror of the woodland lake, and the fishes sought theshadows beneath them.\"\\nIn a  sheltered part of the wood, the sun shoneupon the walls of a farm-house, brightening  the blooming roses, andripening the black juicy berries, which hung on the  loadedcherry-trees, with his hot beams.\"\\nHere sat the lovely wife ofSummer, the same  whom we have seen as a child and a bride; her eyeswere fixed on dark gathering clouds,  which in wavy outlines of blackand indigo were piling themselves up like mountains,  higher andhigher.\"\\nThey came from every side, always increasing like a rising,rolling  sea.\"\\nThen they swooped towards the forest, where every soundhad been silenced as if  by magic, every breath hushed, every birdmute.\"\\nAll nature stood still in grave  suspense.\"\\nBut in the lanes andthe highways, passengers on foot or in carriages were  hurrying to finda place of shelter.\"\\nThen came a flash of light, as if the sun hadrushed  forth from the sky, flaming, burning, all-devouring, anddarkness returned amid a  rolling crash of thunder.\"\\nThe rain poureddown in streams,- now there was darkness,  then blinding light,- nowthrilling silence, then deafening din.\"\\nThe young brown reeds  on themoor waved to and fro in feathery billows; the forest boughs werehidden in a  watery mist, and still light and darkness followed eachother, still came the silence  after the roar, while the corn and theblades of grass lay beaten down and swamped,  so that it seemedimpossible they could ever raise themselves again.\"\\nBut after a  whilethe rain began to fall gently, the sun\\'s rays pierced the clouds,and the  water-drops glittered like pearls on leaf and stem.\"\\nThebirds sang, the fishes leaped  up to the surface of the water, thegnats danced in the sunshine, and yonder, on a  rock by the heavingsalt sea, sat Summer himself, a strong man with sturdy limbs and  long,dripping hair.\"\\nStrengthened by the cool bath, he sat in the warmsunshine, while  all around him renewed nature bloomed strong,luxuriant, and beautiful: it was summer,  warm, lovely summer.\"\\nSweetand pleasant was the fragrance wafted from the clover-field,  where thebees swarmed round the ruined tower, the bramble twined itself overthe old  altar, which, washed by the rain, glittered in the sunshine;and thither flew the queen  bee with her swarm, and prepared wax andhoney.\"\\nBut Summer and his bosom-wife saw it  with different eyes, tothem the altar-table was covered with the offerings of nature.\"\\n Theevening sky shone like gold, no church dome could ever gleam sobrightly, and  between the golden evening and the blushing morningthere was moonlight.\"\\nIt was indeed  summer.\"\\nAnd days and weekspassed, the bright scythes of the reapers glittered in  thecorn-fields, the branches of the apple-trees bent low, heavy withthe red and golden  fruit.\"\\nThe hop, hanging in clusters, filled the airwith sweet fragrance, and beneath  the hazel-bushes, where the nutshung in great bunches, rested a man and a woman- Summer  and hisgrave consort.\"\\n \"See,\" she exclaimed, \"what wealth, what blessings surround us.Everything is  home-like and good, and yet, I know not why, I longfor rest and peace; I can scarcely  express what I feel.\"\\nThey arealready ploughing the fields again; more and more the  people wishfor gain.\"\\nSee, the storks are flocking together, and following theplough  at a short distance.\"\\nThey are the birds from Egypt, who carriedus through the air.\"\\n Do you remember how we came as children to thisland of the north; we brought with  us flowers and bright sunshine, andgreen to the forests, but the wind has been rough  with them, andthey are now become dark and brown, like the trees of the south, butthey  do not, like them, bear golden fruit.\"\\n  \"Do you wish to see golden fruit?\"\\n said the man, \"then rejoice,\"and he lifted his  arm.\"\\nThe leaves of the forest put on colors of redand gold, and bright tints covered  the woodlands.\"\\nThe rose-bushesgleamed with scarlet hips, and the branches of the  elder-trees hungdown with the weight of the full, dark berries.\"\\nThe wild chestnutsfell  ripe from their dark, green shells, and in the forests theviolets bloomed for the  second time.\"\\nBut the queen of the yearbecame more and more silent and pale.\"\\n \"It blows cold,\" she said, \"and night brings the damp mist; I longfor the land of  my childhood.\"\\n Then she saw the storks fly awayevery one, and she stretched out her  hands towards them.\"\\nShe looked atthe empty nests; in one of them grew a long-stalked  corn flower, inanother the yellow mustard seed, as if the nest had been placedthere  only for its comfort and protection, and the sparrows wereflying round them all.\"\\n \"Tweet, where has the master of the nest gone?\"\\n cried one, \"Isuppose he could not  bear it when the wind blew, and therefore hehas left this country.\"\\nI wish him a pleasant  journey.\"\\n  The forest leaves became more and more yellow, leaf after leaffell, and the stormy  winds of Autumn howled.\"\\nThe year was now faradvanced, and upon the fallen, yellow  leaves, lay the queen of theyear, looking up with mild eyes at a gleaming star, and  her husbandstood by her.\"\\nA gust of wind swept through the foliage, and the leavesfell  in a shower.\"\\nThe summer queen was gone, but a butterfly, the lastof the year, flew  through the cold air.\"\\nDamp fogs came, icy windsblew, and the long, dark nights of  winter approached.\"\\nThe ruler of theyear appeared with hair white as snow, but he knew  it not; hethought snow-flakes falling from the sky covered his head, as theydecked  the green fields with a thin, white covering of snow.\"\\nAndthen the church bells rang  out for Christmas time.\"\\n \"The bells are ringing for the new-born year,\" said the ruler,\"soon will a new ruler  and his bride be born, and.\"\\nI shall go torest with my wife in yonder light-giving  star.\"\\n  In the fresh, green fir-wood, where the snow lay all around, stoodthe angel of  Christmas, and consecrated the young trees that were toadorn his feast.\"\\n \"May there be joy in the rooms, and under the green boughs,\"said the old ruler of  the year.\"\\nIn a few weeks he had become a veryold man, with hair as white as snow.\"\\n \"My resting-time draws near;the young pair of the year will soon claim my crown and  sceptre.\"\\n  \"But the night is still thine,\" said the angel of Christmas,\"for power, but not for  rest.\"\\nLet the snow lie warmly upon thetender seed.\"\\nLearn to endure the thought that  another is worshippedwhilst thou art still lord.\"\\nLearn to endure being forgotten  whileyet thou livest.\"\\nThe hour of thy freedom will come when Springappears.\"\\n  \"And when will Spring come?\"\\n asked Winter.\"\\n \"It will come when the stork returns.\"\\n  And with white locks and snowy beard, cold, bent, and hoary, butstrong as the wintry  storm, and firm as the ice, old Winter sat on thesnowdrift-covered hill, looking  towards the south, where Winter hadsat before, and gazed.\"\\nThe ice glittered, the snow  crackled, theskaters skimmed over the polished surface of the lakes; ravens andcrows  formed a pleasing contrast to the white ground, and not a breathof wind stirred, and  in the still air old Winter clenched his fists,and the ice lay fathoms deep between  the lands.\"\\nThen came the sparrowsagain out of the town, and asked, \"Who is that old  man?\"\\n The raven satthere still, or it might be his son, which is the same thing, and  hesaid to them,-  \"It is Winter, the old man of the former year; he is not dead,as the calendar says,  but he is guardian to the spring, which iscoming.\"\\n  \"When will Spring come?\"\\n asked the sparrows, \"for we shall havebetter times then,  and a better rule.\"\\nThe old times are worthnothing.\"\\n  And in quiet thought old Winter looked at the leafless forest,where the graceful form  and bends of each tree and branch could beseen; and while Winter slept, icy mists  came from the clouds, andthe ruler dreamt of his youthful days and of his manhood,  and in themorning dawn the whole forest glittered with hoar frost, which the sunshook  from the branches,- and this was the summer dream of Winter.\"\\n \"When will Spring come?\"\\n asked the sparrows.\"\\n\"Spring!\"\\n Again theecho sounded from  the hills on which the snow lay.\"\\nThe sunshine becamewarmer, the snow melted, and the  birds twittered, \"Spring iscoming!\"\\n And high in the air flew the first stork, and  the secondfollowed;

 and therefore both were put into big silvercases and sent to her.\"\\n The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall wherethe princess was just  playing \"Visitors are coming\" with herladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases  with the presentstherein, she clapped her hands for joy.\"\\n \"I wish it were a little pussy cat,\" she said.\"\\nBut then therose-tree with the beautiful  rose was unpacked.\"\\n \"Oh, how nicely it is made,\" exclaimed the ladies.\"\\n \"It is more than nice,\" said the emperor, \"it is charming.\"\\n  The princess touched it and nearly began to cry.\"\\n \"For shame, pa,\" she said, \"it is not artificial, it is natural!\"\\n  \"For shame, it is natural\" repeated all her ladies.\"\\n \"Let us first see what the other case contains before we areangry,\" said the emperor;  then the nightingale was taken out, and itsang so beautifully that no one could  possibly say anything unkindabout it.\"\\n \"Superbe, charmant,\" said the ladies of the court, for they allprattled French, one  worse than the other.\"\\n \"How much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the latelamented empress,\" said  an old courtier, \"it has exactly the sametone, the same execution.\"\\n  \"You are right,\" said the emperor, and began to cry like alittle child.\"\\n \"I hope it is not natural,\" said the princess.\"\\n \"Yes, certainly it is natural,\" replied those who had broughtthe presents.\"\\n \"Then let it fly,\" said the princess, and refused to see theprince.\"\\n But the prince was not discouraged.\"\\nHe painted his face, put oncommon clothes, pulled  his cap over his forehead, and came back.\"\\n \"Good day, emperor,\" he said, \"could you not give me someemployment at the court?\"\\n  \"There are so many,\" replied the emperor, \"who apply for places,that for the present  I have no vacancy, but I will remember you.\"\\nButwait a moment; it just comes into my  mind, I require somebody tolook after my pigs, for I have a great many.\"\\n  Thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as such helived in a wretchedly  small room near the pigsty; there he workedall day long, and when it was night he  had made a pretty little pot.There were little bells round the rim, and when the water  began toboil in it, the bells began to play the old tune:  \"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,  Three little piggies had she,\" &c.But what was more wonderful was that, when one put  a finger into thesteam rising from the pot, one could at once smell what meals theywere  preparing on every fire in the whole town.\"\\nThat was indeed muchmore remarkable than  the rose.\"\\nWhen the princess with her ladiespassed by and heard the tune, she stopped  and looked quite pleased,for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune  she couldplay, and she played it with one finger.\"\\n \"That is the tune I know,\" she exclaimed.\"\\n\"He must be awell-educated swineherd.\"\\nGo  and ask him how much the instrument is.\"\\n  One of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on pattens.\"\\n \"What will you take for your pot?\"\\n asked the lady.\"\\n \"I will have ten kisses from the princess,\" said the swineherd.\"\\n \"God forbid,\" said the lady.\"\\n \"Well, I cannot sell it for less,\" replied the swineherd.\"\\n \"What did he say?\"\\n said the princess.\"\\n I really cannot tell you,\" replied the lady.\"\\n \"You can whisper it into my ear.\"\\n  \"It is very naughty,\" said the princess, and walked off.\"\\n But when she had gone a little distance, the bells rang again sosweetly:  \"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,  Three little piggies had she,\" &c.\"\\n \"Ask him,\" said the princess, \"if he will be satisfied with tenkisses from one of  my ladies.\"\\n  \"No, thank you,\" said the swineherd: \"ten kisses from theprincess, or I keep my pot.\"\\n  \"That is tiresome,\" said the princess.\"\\n\"But you must standbefore me, so that nobody  can see it.\"\\n  The ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread outtheir dresses, and she  gave the swineherd ten kisses and receivedthe pot.\"\\n That was a pleasure!\"\\nDay and night the water in the pot wasboiling; there was not  a single fire in the whole town of which theydid not know what was preparing on it,  the chamberlain\\'s as well asthe shoemaker\\'s.\"\\nThe ladies danced and clapped their hands  for joy.\"\\n \"We know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will eatporridge and cutlets;  oh, how interesting!\"\\n  \"Very interesting, indeed,\" said the mistress of the household.\"\\nBut you must not  betray me, for I am the emperor\\'s daughter.\"\\n  \"Of course not,\" they all said.\"\\n The swineherd- that is to say, the prince- but they did not knowotherwise than that  he was a real swineherd- did not waste a singleday without doing something; he made  a rattle, which, when turnedquickly round, played all the waltzes, galops, and polkas  knownsince the creation of the world.\"\\n \"But that is superbe,\" said the princess passing by.\"\\n\"I have neverheard a more  beautiful composition.\"\\nGo down and ask him what theinstrument costs; but I shall not  kiss him again.\"\\n  \"He will have a hundred kisses from the princess,\" said thelady, who had gone down  to ask him.\"\\n \"I believe he is mad,\" said the princess, and walked off, but soonshe stopped.\"\\n\"One  must encourage art,\" she said.\"\\n\"I am the emperor\\'sdaughter!\"\\nTell him I will give him  ten kisses, as I did the other day;the remainder one of my ladies can give him.\"\\n \"But we do not like to kiss him\" said the ladies.\"\\n \"That is nonsense,\" said the princess; \"if I can kiss him, you canalso do it.\"\\nRemember  that I give you food and employment.\"\\n And thelady had to go down once more.\"\\n \"A hundred kisses from the princess,\" said the swineherd, \"oreverybody keeps his own.\"\\n  \"Place yourselves before me,\" said the princess then.\"\\nThey didas they were bidden,  and the princess kissed him.\"\\n \"I wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means!\"\\n said theemperor, who had just come  out on his balcony.\"\\nHe rubbed his eyesand put his spectacles on.\"\\n \"The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think.\"\\nI shallhave to go down  and see.\"\\n He pulled up his shoes, for they were downat the heels, and he was very  quick about it.\"\\nWhen he had come downinto the courtyard he walked quite softly, and  the ladies were sobusily engaged in counting the kisses, that all should be fair,  thatthey did not notice the emperor.\"\\nHe raised himself on tiptoe.\"\\n \"What does this mean?\"\\n he said, when he saw that his daughterwas kissing the swineherd,  and then hit their heads with his shoe justas the swineherd received the sixty-eighth  kiss.\"\\n \"Go out of my sight,\" said the emperor, for he was very angry; andboth the princess  and the swineherd were banished from the empire.There she stood and cried, the  swineherd scolded her, and the raincame down in torrents.\"\\n \"Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!\"\\n said the princess, \"I wishI had accepted the  prince.\"\\nOh, how wretched I am!\"\\n  The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw off hispoor attire and stepped  forth in his princely garments; he looked sobeautiful that the princess could not  help bowing to him.\"\\n \"I have now learnt to despise you,\" he said.\"\\n\"You refused anhonest prince; you did  not appreciate the rose and the nightingale;but you did not mind kissing a swineherd  for his toys; you have no onebut yourself to blame!\"\\n  And then he returned into his kingdom and left her behind.\"\\nShecould now sing at her  leisure:  \"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,  Three little piggies has she,\" &c.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE THISTLE\\'S EXPERIENCES  by Hans Christian Andersen  BELONGING to the lordly manor-house was beautiful, well-keptgarden, with rare trees  and flowers; the guests of the proprietordeclared their admiration of it; the people  of the neighborhood,from town and country, came on Sundays and holidays, and  askedpermission to see the garden; indeed, whole schools used to pay visitsto it.\"\\n Outside the garden, by the palings at the road-side, stood a greatmighty Thistle,  which spread out in many directions from the root,so that it might have been called  a thistle bush.\"\\nNobody looked at it,except the old Ass which drew the milk-maid\\'s  cart.\"\\nThis Ass used tostretch out his neck towards the Thistle, and say, \"You are  beautiful;I should like to eat you!\"\\n But his halter was not long enough to lethim  reach it and eat it.\"\\n There was great company at the manor-house- some very noble peoplefrom the capital;  young pretty girls, and among them a young ladywho came from a long distance.\"\\nShe  had come from Scotland, and wasof high birth, and was rich in land and in gold- a  bride worthwinning, said more than one of the young gentlemen; and their ladymothers  said the same thing.\"\\n The young people amused themselves on the lawn, and played atball; they wandered among  the flowers, and each of the young girlsbroke off a flower, and fastened it in a young  gentleman\\'s buttonhole.But the young Scotch lady looked round, for a long time, in  anundecided way.\"\\nNone of the flowers seemed to suit her taste.\"\\nThenher eye glanced  across the paling- outside stood the great thistlebush, with the reddish-blue, sturdy  flowers; she saw them, she smiled,and asked the son of the house to pluck one for  her.\"\\n \"It is the flower of Scotland,\" she said.\"\\n\"It blooms in thescutcheon of my country.\"\\n Give me yonder flower.\"\\n  And he brought the fairest blossom, and pricked his fingers ascompletely as if it  had grown on the sharpest rose bush.\"\\n She placed the thistle-flower in the buttonhole of the youngman, and he felt himself  highly honored.\"\\nEach of the other younggentlemen would willingly have given his own  beautiful flower tohave worn this one, presented by the fair hand of the Scottish  maiden.And if the son of the house felt himself honored, what were thefeelings of  the Thistle bush?\"\\nIt seemed to him as if dew andsunshine were streaming through him.\"\\n \"I am something more than I knew of,\" said the Thistle toitself.\"\\n\"I suppose my right  place is really inside the palings, andnot outside.\"\\nOne is often strangely placed  in this world; but now Ihave at least managed to get one of my people within the pale,  andindeed into a buttonhole!\"\\n  The Thistle told this event to every blossom that unfolded itself,and not many days  had gone by before the Thistle heard, not frommen, not from the twittering of the  birds, but from the air itself,which stores up the sounds, and carries them far around\\ufffeout of themost retired walks of the garden, and out of the rooms of the house,in which  doors and windows stood open, that the young gentleman whohad received the  thistle-flower from the hand of the fair Scottishmaiden had also now received the  heart and hand of the lady inquestion.\"\\nThey were a handsome pair- it was a good match.\"\\n \"That match I made up!\"\\n said the Thistle; and he thought of theflower he had given  for the buttonhole.\"\\nEvery flower that opened heardof this occurrence.\"\\n \"I shall certainly be transplanted into the garden,\" thought theThistle, and perhaps  put into a pot, which crowds one in.\"\\nThat is saidto be the greatest of all honors.\"\\n  And the Thistle pictured this to himself in such a livelymanner, that at last he said,  with full conviction, \"I am to betransplanted into a pot.\"\\n  Then he promised every little thistle flower which unfolded itselfthat it also should  be put into a pot, and perhaps into abuttonhole, the highest honor that could be  attained.\"\\nBut not one ofthem was put into a pot, much less into a buttonhole.\"\\nThey  drank inthe sunlight and the air; lived on the sunlight by day, and on the dewby night;  bloomed- were visited by bees and hornets, who lookedafter the honey, the dowry of  the flower, and they took the honey, andleft the flower where it was.\"\\n \"The thievish rabble!\"\\n said the Thistle.\"\\n\"If I could only stabevery one of them!\"\\nBut  I cannot.\"\\n  The flowers hung their heads and faded; but after a time newones came.\"\\n \"You come in good time,\" said the Thistle.\"\\n\"I am expecting everymoment to get across  the fence.\"\\n  A few innocent daisies, and a long thin dandelion, stood andlistened in deep  admiration, and believed everything they heard.\"\\n The old Ass of the milk-cart stood at the edge of thefield-road, and glanced across  at the blooming thistle bush; but hishalter was too short, and he could not reach  it.\"\\n And the Thistle thought so long of the thistle of Scotland, towhose family he said  he belonged, that he fancied at last that hehad come from Scotland, and that his  parents had been put into thenational escutcheon.\"\\nThat was a great thought; but, you  see, a greatthistle has a right to a great thought.\"\\n \"One is often of so grand a family, that one may not know it,\"said the Nettle, who  grew close by.\"\\nHe had a kind of idea that hemight be made into cambric if he were  rightly treated.\"\\n And the summer went by, and the autumn went by.\"\\nThe leaves fellfrom the trees, and  the few flowers left had deeper colors and lessscent.\"\\nThe gardener\\'s boy sang in the  garden, across the palings:  \"Up the hill, down the dale we wend,  That is life, from beginning to end.\"\\n  The young fir trees in the forest began to long for Christmas, butit was a long time  to Christmas yet.\"\\n \"Here I am standing yet!\"\\n said the Thistle.\"\\n\"It is as if nobodythought of me, and  yet I managed the match.\"\\nThey were betrothed, andthey have had their wedding; it is  now a week ago.\"\\nI won\\'t take asingle step-because I can\\'t.\"\\n  A few more weeks went by.\"\\nThe Thistle stood there with his lastsingle flower large  and full.\"\\nThis flower had shot up from near theroots; the wind blew cold over it,  and the colors vanished, and theflower grew in size, and looked like a silvered  sunflower.\"\\n One day the young pair, now man and wife, came into the garden.They went along by  the paling, and the young wife looked across it.\"\\n \"There\\'s the great thistle still growing,\" she said.\"\\n\"It has noflowers now.\"\\n  \"Oh, yes, the ghost of the last one is there still,\" said he.And he pointed to the  silvery remains of the flower, which looked likea flower themselves.\"\\n \"It is pretty, certainly,\" she said.\"\\n\"Such an one must be carvedon the frame of our  picture.\"\\n  And the young man had to climb across the palings again, and tobreak off the calyx  of the thistle.\"\\nIt pricked his fingers, but thenhe had called it a ghost.\"\\nAnd this  thistle-calyx came into the garden,and into the house, and into the drawing-room.\"\\n There stood apicture- \"Young Couple.\"\\n A thistle-flower was painted in thebuttonhole  of the bridegroom.\"\\nThey spoke about this, and also aboutthe thistle-flower they  brought, the last thistle-flower, now gleaminglike silver, whose picture was carved  on the frame.\"\\n And the breeze carried what was spoken away, far away.\"\\n \"What one can experience!\"\\n said the Thistle Bush.\"\\n\"My first bornwas put into a  buttonhole, and my youngest has been put in a frame.Where shall I go?\"\\n  And the Ass stood by the road-side, and looked across at theThistle.\"\\n \"Come to me, my nibble darling!\"\\n said he.\"\\n\"I can\\'t get across toyou.\"\\n  But the Thistle did not answer.\"\\nHe became more and morethoughtful- kept on thinking  and thinking till near Christmas, andthen a flower of thought came forth.\"\\n \"If the children are only good, the parents do not mind standingoutside the garden  pale.\"\\n  \"That\\'s an honorable thought,\" said the Sunbeam.\"\\n\"You shall alsohave a good place.\"\\n  \"In a pot or in a frame?\"\\n asked the Thistle.\"\\n \"In a story,\" replied the Sunbeam.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE THORNY ROAD OF HONOR  by Hans Christian Andersen  AN old story yet lives of the \"Thorny Road of Honor,\" of amarksman, who indeed attained  to rank and office, but only after alifelong and weary strife against difficulties.\"\\n Who has not, inreading this story, thought of his own strife, and of his own  numerous\"difficulties?\"\\n The story is very closely akin to reality;

hehad been to the wars, and was now  returning home.\"\\n As he walked on, he met a very frightful-looking old witch inthe road.\"\\nHer under-lip  hung quite down on her breast, and she stoppedand said, \"Good evening, soldier; you  have a very fine sword, and alarge knapsack, and you are a real soldier; so you shall  have asmuch money as ever you like.\"\\n  \"Thank you, old witch,\" said the soldier.\"\\n \"Do you see that large tree,\" said the witch, pointing to a treewhich stood beside  them.\"\\n\"Well, it is quite hollow inside, and youmust climb to the top, when you will  see a hole, through which you canlet yourself down into the tree to a great depth.\"\\n I will tie a roperound your body, so that I can pull you up again when you call outto  me.\"\\n  \"But what am I to do, down there in the tree?\"\\n asked the soldier.\"\\n \"Get money,\" she replied; \"for you must know that when you reachthe ground under the  tree, you will find yourself in a large hall,lighted up by three hundred lamps; you  will then see three doors,which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the  locks.\"\\nOnentering the first of the chambers, to which these doors lead, youwill see  a large chest, standing in the middle of the floor, andupon it a dog seated, with  a pair of eyes as large as teacups.\"\\nBut youneed not be at all afraid of him; I will  give you my blue checkedapron, which you must spread upon the floor, and then boldly  seizehold of the dog, and place him upon it.\"\\nYou can then open the chest,and take  from it as many pence as you please, they are only copperpence; but if you would rather  have silver money, you must go into thesecond chamber.\"\\nHere you will find another  dog, with eyes as big asmill-wheels; but do not let that trouble you.\"\\nPlace him upon  my apron,and then take what money you please.\"\\nIf, however, you like goldbest, enter  the third chamber, where there is another chest full ofit.\"\\nThe dog who sits on this  chest is very dreadful; his eyes are asbig as a tower, but do not mind him.\"\\nIf he  also is placed upon myapron, he cannot hurt you, and you may take from the chest what  goldyou will.\"\\n  \"This is not a bad story,\" said the soldier; \"but what am I togive you, you old witch?\"\\n for, of course, you do not mean to tell meall this for nothing.\"\\n  \"No,\" said the witch; \"but I do not ask for a single penny.\"\\nOnlypromise to bring me  an old tinder-box, which my grandmother leftbehind the last time she went down there.\"\\n  \"Very well; I promise.\"\\nNow tie the rope round my body.\"\\n  \"Here it is,\" replied the witch; \"and here is my blue checkedapron.\"\\n  As soon as the rope was tied, the soldier climbed up the tree, andlet himself down  through the hollow to the ground beneath; and here hefound, as the witch had told  him, a large hall, in which manyhundred lamps were all burning.\"\\nThen he opened the  first door.\"\\n\"Ah!\"\\nthere sat the dog, with the eyes as large as teacups, staring at  him.\"\\n \"You\\'re a pretty fellow,\" said the soldier, seizing him, andplacing him on the witch\\'s  apron, while he filled his pockets from thechest with as many pieces as they would  hold.\"\\nThen he closed thelid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another  chamber,And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.\"\\n \"You had better not look at me in that way,\" said the soldier;\"you will make your  eyes water;\" and then he seated him also uponthe apron, and opened the chest.\"\\nBut  when he saw what a quantity ofsilver money it contained, he very quickly threw away  all thecoppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack withnothing but  silver.\"\\n Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was reallyhideous; his eyes were,  truly, as big as towers, and they turned roundand round in his head like wheels.\"\\n \"Good morning,\" said the soldier, touching his cap, for he hadnever seen such a dog  in his life.\"\\nBut after looking at him moreclosely, he thought he had been civil enough,  so he placed him onthe floor, and opened the chest.\"\\nGood gracious, what a quantity  ofgold there was!\"\\nenough to buy all the sugar-sticks of thesweet-stuff women; all  the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horsesin the world, or even the whole town itself  There was, indeed, animmense quantity.\"\\nSo the soldier now threw away all the silver  moneyhe had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with goldinstead; and not  only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his capand boots, so that he could scarcely  walk.\"\\n He was really rich now; so he replaced the dog on the chest,closed the door, and called  up through the tree, \"Now pull me out, youold witch.\"\\n  \"Have you got the tinder-box?\"\\n asked the witch.\"\\n \"No; I declare I quite forgot it.\"\\n So he went back and fetched thetinderbox, and then  the witch drew him up out of the tree, and hestood again in the high road, with his  pockets, his knapsack, his cap,and his boots full of gold.\"\\n \"What are you going to do with the tinder-box?\"\\n asked the soldier.\"\\n \"That is nothing to you,\" replied the witch; \"you have themoney, now give me the  tinder-box.\"\\n  \"I tell you what,\" said the soldier, \"if you don\\'t tell me whatyou are going to do  with it, I will draw my sword and cut off yourhead.\"\\n  \"No,\" said the witch.\"\\n The soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she lay on theground.\"\\nThen he  tied up all his money in her apron.\"\\nand slung it onhis back like a bundle, put the  tinderbox in his pocket, and walkedoff to the nearest town.\"\\nIt was a very nice town,  and he put up at thebest inn, and ordered a dinner of all his favorite dishes, for  nowhe was rich and had plenty of money.\"\\n The servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly werea shabby pair to be  worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had notyet bought any new ones.\"\\nThe next day,  however, he procured somegood clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon  became knownas a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him allthe  wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king\\'sbeautiful daughter, the  princess.\"\\n \"Where can I see her?\"\\n asked the soldier.\"\\n \"She is not to be seen at all,\" they said; \"she lives in a largecopper castle,  surrounded by walls and towers.\"\\nNo one but the kinghimself can pass in or out, for  there has been a prophecy that shewill marry a common soldier, and the king cannot  bear to think of sucha marriage.\"\\n  \"I should like very much to see her,\" thought the soldier; buthe could not obtain  permission to do so.\"\\nHowever, he passed a verypleasant time; went to the theatre,  drove in the king\\'s garden, andgave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very  good of him; heremembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.Now  he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who alldeclared he was a fine fellow  and a real gentleman, and all thisgratified him exceedingly.\"\\nBut his money would not  last forever; andas he spent and gave away a great deal daily, and received none,  hefound himself at last with only two shillings left.\"\\nSo he wasobliged to leave his  elegant rooms, and live in a little garretunder the roof, where he had to clean his  own boots, and even mendthem with a large needle.\"\\nNone of his friends came to see  him, therewere too many stairs to mount up.\"\\nOne dark evening, he had not evena penny  to buy a candle; then all at once he remembered that there wasa piece of candle stuck  in the tinder-box, which he had brought fromthe old tree, into which the witch had  helped him.\"\\n He found the tinder-box, but no sooner had he struck a fewsparks from the flint and  steel, than the door flew open and the dogwith eyes as big as teacups, whom he had  seen while down in thetree, stood before him, and said, \"What orders, master?\"\\n  \"Hallo,\" said the soldier; \"well this is a pleasant tinderbox,if it brings me all  I wish for.\"\\n  \"Bring me some money,\" said he to the dog.\"\\n He was gone in a moment, and presently returned, carrying alarge bag of coppers in  his month.\"\\nThe soldier very soon discoveredafter this the value of the tinder-box.\"\\n If he struck the flint once,the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his  appearance; iftwice, the dog came from the chest of silver; and if three times,the  dog with eyes like towers, who watched over the gold.\"\\nThesoldier had now plenty of  money; he returned to his elegant rooms, andreappeared in his fine clothes, so that  his friends knew him againdirectly, and made as much of him as before.\"\\n After a while he began to think it was very strange that no onecould get a look at  the princess.\"\\n\"Every one says she is verybeautiful,\" thought he to himself; \"but what  is the use of that if sheis to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so many  towers.Can I by any means get to see her.\"\\nStop!\"\\nwhere is my tinder-box?\"\\n Thenhe struck  a light, and in a moment the dog, with eyes as big asteacups, stood before him.\"\\n \"It is midnight,\" said the soldier, \"yet I should very much liketo see the princess,  if only for a moment.\"\\n  The dog disappeared instantly, and before the soldier could evenlook round, he  returned with the princess.\"\\nShe was lying on thedog\\'s back asleep, and looked so lovely,  that every one who saw herwould know she was a real princess.\"\\nThe soldier could not  help kissingher, true soldier as he was.\"\\nThen the dog ran back with theprincess; but  in the morning, while at breakfast with the king andqueen, she told them what a  singular dream she had had during thenight, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden  on the dog\\'sback, and been kissed by the soldier.\"\\n \"That is a very pretty story, indeed,\" said the queen.\"\\nSo the nextnight one of the  old ladies of the court was set to watch by theprincess\\'s bed, to discover whether  it really was a dream, or whatelse it might be.\"\\n The soldier longed very much to see the princess once more, sohe sent for the dog  again in the night to fetch her, and to run withher as fast as ever he could.\"\\nBut  the old lady put on water boots, andran after him as quickly as he did, and found  that he carried theprincess into a large house.\"\\nShe thought it would help her to  rememberthe place if she made a large cross on the door with a piece of chalk.Then  she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with theprincess.\"\\nBut when he  saw that a cross had been made on the door ofthe house, where the soldier lived, he  took another piece of chalk andmade crosses on all the doors in the town, so that  the lady-in-waitingmight not be able to find out the right door.\"\\n Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the lady andall the officers  of the household, to see where the princess had been.\"\\n \"Here it is,\" said the king, when they came to the first door witha cross on it.\"\\n No, my dear husband, it must be that one,\" said the queen,pointing to a second door  having a cross also.\"\\n \"And here is one, and there is another!\"\\n they all exclaimed; forthere were crosses  on all the doors in every direction.\"\\n So they felt it would be useless to search any farther.\"\\nBut thequeen was a very clever  woman; she could do a great deal more thanmerely ride in a carriage.\"\\nShe took her  large gold scissors, cut apiece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag.\"\\n This bag shefilled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess\\'s neck;and  then she cut a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might bescattered on the ground  as the princess went along.\"\\nDuring thenight, the dog came again and carried the  princess on his back, andran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and  wishedthat he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife.\"\\nThedog did  not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the wayfrom the castle wall to the  soldier\\'s house, and even up to thewindow, where he had climbed with the princess.\"\\n Therefore in themorning the king and queen found out where their daughter had been,and  the soldier was taken up and put in prison.\"\\nOh, how dark anddisagreeable it was as  he sat there, and the people said to him,\"To-morrow you will be hanged.\"\\n It was not  very pleasant news, andbesides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn.\"\\nIn the morning  hecould see through the iron grating of the little window how the peoplewere hastening  out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drumsbeating, and saw the soldiers  marching.\"\\nEvery one ran out to look atthem.\"\\nand a shoemaker\\'s boy, with a leather  apron and slippers on,galloped by so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and  struckagainst the wall where the soldier sat looking through the irongrating.\"\\n\"Hallo,  you shoemaker\\'s boy, you need not be in such ahurry,\" cried the soldier to him.\"\\n\"There  will be nothing to see till Icome; but if you will run to the house where I have been  living, andbring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings, but you mustput  your best foot foremost.\"\\n  The shoemaker\\'s boy liked the idea of getting the fourshillings, so he ran very fast  and fetched the tinder-box, and gave itto the soldier.\"\\nAnd now we shall see what  happened.\"\\nOutside the town alarge gibbet had been erected, round which stood the  soldiers andseveral thousands of people.\"\\nThe king and the queen sat on splendidthrones  opposite to the judges and the whole council.\"\\nThe soldieralready stood on the ladder;  but as they were about to place therope around his neck, he said that an innocent  request was oftengranted to a poor criminal before he suffered death.\"\\nHe wished  verymuch to smoke a pipe, as it would be the last pipe he should eversmoke in the  world.\"\\nThe king could not refuse this request, so thesoldier took his tinder-box,  and struck fire, once, twice, thrice,-and there in a moment stood all the dogs;- the  one with eyes as big asteacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the  third,whose eyes were like towers.\"\\n\"Help me now, that I may not behanged,\" cried the  soldier.\"\\n And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors;seized one by the legs,  and another by the nose, and tossed themmany feet high in the air, so that they fell  down and were dashed topieces.\"\\n \"I will not be touched,\" said the king.\"\\nBut the largest dog seizedhim, as well as  the queen, and threw them after the others.\"\\nThen thesoldiers and all the people were  afraid, and cried, \"Good soldier, youshall be our king, and you shall marry the  beautiful princess.\"\\n  So they placed the soldier in the king\\'s carriage, and the threedogs ran on in front  and cried \"Hurrah!\"\\n and the little boyswhistled through their fingers, and the  soldiers presented arms.\"\\nTheprincess came out of the copper castle, and became queen,  which wasvery pleasing to her.\"\\nThe wedding festivities lasted a whole week, andthe  dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE TOAD  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; itwas heavy work turning  the handle when any one had to raise abucketful of water over the edge of the well.\"\\n Though the water wasclear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to  mirroritself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, greenthings grew  forth between the stones in the sides of the well.\"\\n Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race.\"\\nThey had, in fact,come head-over-heels  down the well, in the person of the oldMother-Toad, who was still alive.\"\\nThe green  Frogs, who had beenestablished there a long time, and swam about in the water,  calledthem \"well-guests.\"\\n But the new-comers seemed determined to stay wherethey were,  for they found it very agreeable living \"in a dry place,\"as they called the wet stones.\"\\n The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller.\"\\nShe happened to be inthe water-bucket when  it was drawn up, but the light became too strongfor her, and she got a pain in her  eyes.\"\\nFortunately she scrambled outof the bucket; but she fell into the water with  a terrible flop, andhad to lie sick for three days with pains in her back.\"\\nShe  certainlyhad not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, andall the  Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world.\"\\nTheMother-Toad might have told  this and that, if she had chosen, butshe never answered when they asked her anything,  and so they leftoff asking.\"\\n \"She\\'s thick, and fat and ugly,\" said the young green Frogs;\"and her children will  be just as ugly as she is.\"\\n  \"That may be,\" retorted the mother-Toad, \"but one of them has ajewel in his head,  or else I have the jewel.\"\\n  The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did notplease them, they made  grimaces and dived down under the water.\"\\nButthe little Toads kicked up their hind  legs from mere pride, for eachof them thought that he must have the jewel; and then  they sat andheld their heads quite still.\"\\nBut at length they asked what it wasthat  made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be.\"\\n \"Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannotdescribe it,\" said the  Mother-Toad.\"\\n\"It\\'s something which onecarries about for one\\'s own pleasure, and that  makes other peopleangry.\"\\nBut don\\'t ask me any questions, for I shan\\'t answer you.\"\\n  \"Well, I haven\\'t got the jewel,\" said the smallest of the Toads;she was as ugly as  a toad can be.\"\\n\"Why should I have such a preciousthing?\"\\nAnd if it makes others angry,  it can\\'t give me any pleasure.No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well,  and look out;it must be beautiful up there.\"\\n  \"You\\'d better stay where you are,\" said the old Mother-Toad,\"for you know everything  here, and you can tell what you have.\"\\nTakecare of the bucket, for it will crush you  to death; and even if youget into it safely, you may fall out.\"\\nAnd it\\'s not every  one who fallsso cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones.\"\\n \"Quack!\"\\n said the little Toad; and that\\'s just as if one of uswere to say, \"Aha!\"\\n  She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and tolook over; she felt  such a longing for the green, up there; and thenext morning, when it chanced that  the bucket was being drawn up,filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in  front of the stoneon which the Toad sat, the little creature\\'s heart moved within  it,and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently wasdrawn to the top,  and emptied out.\"\\n \"Ugh, you beast!\"\\n said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket,when he saw the toad.\"\\n \"You\\'re the ugliest thing I\\'ve seen for onewhile.\"\\n And he made a kick with his wooden  shoe at the toad, whichjust escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the  nettleswhich grew high by the well\\'s brink.\"\\nHere she saw stem by stem, butshe looked  up also; the sun shone through the leaves, which were quitetransparent; and she felt  as a person would feel who steps suddenlyinto a great forest, where the sun looks  in between the branches andleaves.\"\\n \"It\\'s much nicer here than down in the well!\"\\nI should like to stayhere my whole life  long!\"\\n said the little Toad.\"\\nSo she lay there foran hour, yes, for two hours.\"\\n\"I wonder  what is to be found up here?\"\\nAsI have come so far, I must try to go still farther.\"\\n  And so shecrawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got out upon the highway,where  the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over asshe marched across the  way.\"\\n \"I\\'ve got to a dry place.\"\\nnow, and no mistake,\" said the Toad.\"\\nIt\\'s almost too much  of a good thing here; it tickles one so.\"\\n  She came to the ditch; and forget-me-nots were growing there,and meadow-sweet; and  a very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn,and elder bushes grew there, too,  and bindweed with white flowers.\"\\nGaycolors were to be seen here, and a butterfly,  too, was flitting by.The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that  itmight look about better in the world, which was quite a naturalthing to do.\"\\n \"If one could only make such a journey as that!\"\\n said the Toad.\"\\nCroak!\"\\nhow capital  that would be.\"\\n  Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, andexperienced no want of  provisions.\"\\nOn the ninth day she thought,\"Forward!\"\\nonward!\"\\n But what could she find  more charming andbeautiful?\"\\nPerhaps a little toad or a few green frogs.\"\\nDuring the  lastnight there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there werecousins in the  neighborhood.\"\\n \"It\\'s a glorious thing to live!\"\\nglorious to get out of the well,and to lie among the  stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dustyroad.\"\\nBut onward, onward!\"\\nthat we may  find frogs or a little toad.We can\\'t do without that; nature alone is not enough for  one.\"\\n Andso she went forward on her journey.\"\\n She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round aboutwhich grew reeds; and  she walked into it.\"\\n \"It will be too damp for you here,\" said the Frogs; \"but you arevery welcome!\"\\nAre  you a he or a she?\"\\nBut it doesn\\'t matter; you areequally welcome.\"\\n  And she was invited to the concert in the evening- the familyconcert; great enthusiasm  and thin voices; we know the sort ofthing.\"\\nNo refreshments were given, only there  was plenty to drink, forthe whole pond was free.\"\\n \"Now I shall resume my journey,\" said the little Toad; for shealways felt a longing  for something better.\"\\n She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw themoon gleaming; and  then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher andhigher.\"\\n \"Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well.\"\\nImust get higher  yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing.\"\\n Andwhen the moon became round and full,  the poor creature thought, \"Iwonder if that is the bucket which will be let down,  and into whichI must step to get higher up?\"\\nOr is the sun the great bucket?\"\\nHowgreat  it is!\"\\nhow bright it is!\"\\nIt can take up all.\"\\nI must look out,that I may not miss the  opportunity.\"\\nOh, how it seems to shine in myhead!\"\\nI don\\'t think the jewel can shine  brighter.\"\\nBut I haven\\'t thejewel; not that I cry about that- no, I must go higher  up, intosplendor and joy!\"\\nI feel so confident, and yet I am afraid.\"\\nIt\\'s adifficult  step to take, and yet it must be taken.\"\\nOnward, therefore,straight onward!\"\\n  She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soonfound herself on  a road beside which people dwelt; but there wereflower gardens as well as kitchen  gardens.\"\\nAnd she sat down to rest bya kitchen garden.\"\\n \"What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew!and how beautiful  and great the world is!\"\\nBut one must look round init, and not stay in one spot.\"\\n And  then she hopped into the kitchengarden.\"\\n\"How green it is here!\"\\nhow beautiful it is  here!\"\\n  \"I know that,\" said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, \"my leaf isthe largest here.\"\\nIt  hides half the world from me, but I don\\'t carefor the world.\"\\n  \"Cluck, cluck!\"\\n And some fowls came.\"\\nThey tripped about in thecabbage garden.\"\\nThe  Fowl who marched at the head of them had a longsight, and she spied the Caterpillar  on the green leaf, and peckedat it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where  it twistedand writhed.\"\\n The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with theother, for she did not know  what the end of this writhing would be.\"\\n \"It doesn\\'t do that with a good will,\" thought the Fowl, andlifted up her head to  peck at the Caterpillar.\"\\n The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straightup towards the Fowl.\"\\n \"Aha, it has allies,\" quoth the Fowl.\"\\n\"Just look at the crawlingthing!\"\\n And then the  Fowl turned away.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care for the littlegreen morsel; it would only tickle my  throat.\"\\n The other fowls tookthe same view of it, and they all turned away together.\"\\n \"I writhed myself free,\" said the Caterpillar.\"\\n\"What a goodthing it is when one has  presence of mind!\"\\nBut the hardest thingremains to be done, and that is to get on my  leaf again.\"\\nWhere is it?\"\\n  And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy.\"\\nShe wasglad that in her  ugliness she had frightened the fowls.\"\\n \"What do you mean by that?\"\\n cried the Caterpillar.\"\\n\"I wriggledmyself free from the  Fowl.\"\\nYou are very disagreeable to look at.Cannot I be left in peace on my own property?\"\\n Now I smell cabbage; nowI am near my leaf.\"\\nNothing is so beautiful as property.\"\\nBut  I mustgo higher up.\"\\n  \"Yes, higher up,\" said the little Toad; \"higher-up!\"\\nShe feels justas I do; but she\\'s  not in a good humor to-day.\"\\nThat\\'s because of thefright.\"\\nWe all want to go higher  up.\"\\n And she looked up as high asever she could.\"\\n The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house.\"\\nHeclapped with his beak,  and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.\"\\n \"How high up they live!\"\\n thought the Toad.\"\\n\"If one could onlyget as high as that!\"\\n  In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet andthe other a  scientific searcher into the secrets of nature.\"\\nThe onesang and wrote joyously of  everything that God had created, and how itwas mirrored in his heart.\"\\nHe sang it out  clearly, sweetly, richly, inwell-sounding verses; while the other investigated  created matteritself, and even cut it open where need was.\"\\nHe looked upon  God\\'screation as a great sum in arithmetic- subtracted, multiplied, andtried to know  it within and without, and to talk with understandingconcerning it; and that was a  very sensible thing; and he spokejoyously and cleverly of it.\"\\nThey were good, joyful  men, those two,  \"There sits a good specimen of a toad,\" said the naturalist.\"\\n\"Imust have that fellow  in a bottle of spirits.\"\\n  \"You have two of them already,\" replied the poet.\"\\n\"Let the thingsit there and enjoy  its life.\"\\n  \"But it\\'s so wonderfully ugly,\" persisted the first.\"\\n \"Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,\" said the poet, \"Itoo should be for  cutting it open.\\'  \"A jewel!\"\\n cried the naturalist.\"\\n\"You seem to know a great dealabout natural history.\"\\n  \"But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief thatjust as the toad is  the ugliest of animals, it should often carrythe most precious jewel in its head?\"\\n Is it not just the same thingwith men?\"\\nWhat a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still  more,Socrates!\"\\n  The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half ofwhat she had heard.\"\\n The two friends walked on, and thus she escapedthe fate of being bottled up in spirits.\"\\n \"Those two also were speaking of the jewel,\" said the Toad toherself.\"\\n\"What a good  thing that I have not got it!\"\\nI might havebeen in a very disagreeable position.\"\\n  Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.Father-Stork was making a speech  to his family, and his family wasglancing down at the two young men in the kitchen  garden.\"\\n \"Man is the most conceited creature!\"\\n said the Stork.\"\\n\"Listenhow their jaws are  wagging; and for all that they can\\'t clap properly.They boast of their gifts of  eloquence and their language!\"\\nYes, a finelanguage truly!\"\\nWhy, it changes in every  day\\'s journey we make.\"\\nOne ofthem doesn\\'t understand another.\"\\nNow, we can speak our  language overthe whole earth- up in the North and in Egypt.\"\\nAnd then men are notable  to fly, moreover.\"\\nThey rush along by means of an invention theycall \\'railway;\\' but  they often break their necks over it.\"\\nIt makesmy beak turn cold when I think of it.\"\\n The world could get on withoutmen.\"\\nWe could do without them very well, so long as  we only keep frogsand earth-worms.\"\\n  \"That was a powerful speech,\" thought the little Toad.\"\\n\"What agreat man that is yonder!\"\\n and how high he sits!\"\\nHigher than ever I sawany one sit yet; and how he can swim!\"\\n  she cried, as the Storksoared away through the air with outspread pinions.\"\\n And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told aboutEgypt and the waters  of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that was tobe found in that strange land; and  all this sounded new and verycharming to the little Toad.\"\\n \"I must go to Egypt!\"\\n said she.\"\\n\"If the Stork or one of hisyoung ones would only take  me!\"\\nI would oblige him in return.\"\\nYes, Ishall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!\"\\nAll  the longing and all thepleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in  one\\'shead.\"\\n  And it was just she who had the jewel.\"\\nThat jewel was thecontinual striving and desire  to go upward- ever upward.\"\\nIt gleamed inher head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly  in her longing.\"\\n Then, suddenly, up came the Stork.\"\\nHe had seen the Toad in thegrass, and stooped down  and seized the little creature anything butgently.\"\\nThe Stork\\'s beak pinched her, and  the wind whistled; it wasnot exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward  towards Egypt-and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemedto  fly out of them.\"\\n \"Quunk!- ah!\"\\n  The body was dead- the Toad was killed!\"\\nBut the spark that hadshot forth from her  eyes; what became of that?\"\\n The sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from thehead of the toad.\"\\n Whither?\"\\n Ask not the naturalist; rather ask the poet.\"\\nHe will tell itthee under the guise of  a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on thecabbage, and the Stork family belong to the  story.\"\\nThink!\"\\ntheCaterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly;  theStork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, andyet finds  the shortest way home to the same country- to the same roof.Nay, that is almost too  improbable; and yet it is true.\"\\nYou may askthe naturalist, he will confess it is so;  and you know it yourself,for you have seen it.\"\\n But the jewel in the head of the toad?\"\\n Seek it in the sun; see it there if you can.\"\\n The brightness is too dazzling there.\"\\nWe have not yet such eyes ascan see into the  glories which God has created, but we shall receivethem by-and-by; and that will be  the most beautiful story of all,and we shall all have our share in it.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE TOP AND BALL  by Hans Christian Andersen  A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box, amongother toys, and the top  said to the ball, \"Shall we be married, aswe live in the same box?\"\\n  But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thoughtas much of herself  as any other young lady, would not evencondescend to reply.\"\\n The next day came the little boy to whom the playthingsbelonged, and he painted the  top red and yellow, and drove abrass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the  top wasspinning round it looked splendid.\"\\n \"Look at me,\" said the top to the ball.\"\\n\"What do you say now?Shall we be engaged to  each other?\"\\nWe should suit so well; you spring,and I dance.\"\\nNo one could be happier  than we should be.\"\\n  \"Indeed!\"\\ndo you think so?\"\\nPerhaps you do not know that my fatherand mother were morocco  slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in mybody.\"\\n  \"Yes; but I am made of mahogany,\" said the top.\"\\n\"The major himselfturned me.\"\\nHe has  a turning lathe of his own, and it is a greatamusement to him.\"\\n  \"Can I believe it?\"\\n asked the ball.\"\\n \"May I never be whipped again,\" said the top, \"if I am not tellingyou the truth.\"\\n  \"You certainly know how to speak for yourself very well,\" said theball; \"but I cannot  accept your proposal.\"\\nI am almost engaged to aswallow.\"\\nEvery time I fly up in the  air, he puts his head out of thenest, and says, \\'Will you?\\' and I have said, \\'Yes,\\'  to myselfsilently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I willpromise never  to forget you.\"\\n  \"Much good that will be to me,\" said the top; and they spoke toeach other no more.\"\\n Next day the ball was taken out by the boy.\"\\nThe top saw itflying high in the air,  like a bird, till it would go quite out ofsight.\"\\nEach time it came back, as it touched  the earth, it gave ahigher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards,  orfrom having a Spanish cork in its body.\"\\nBut the ninth time it rosein the air, it  remained away, and did not return.\"\\nThe boy searchedeverywhere for it, but he searched  in vain, for it could not be found;it was gone.\"\\n \"I know very well where she is,\" sighed the top; \"she is in theswallow\\'s nest, and  has married the swallow.\"\\n  The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball.His love increased  the more, just because he could not get her; andthat she should have been won by another,  was the worst of all.\"\\nThetop still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think  of theball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed tohis fancy.\"\\n Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old.\"\\nThetop, also, was no  longer young; but there came a day when he lookedhandsomer than ever; for he was gilded  all over.\"\\nHe was now a goldentop, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite  loud, and wassomething worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and thenhe,  also, was gone.\"\\nThey searched everywhere, even in the cellar,but he was nowhere to  be found.\"\\nWhere could he be?\"\\nHe had jumpedinto the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish  were lying:cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from  thegutter under the roof.\"\\n \"Now I am in a nice place,\" said he; \"my gilding will soon bewashed off here.\"\\nOh dear,  what a set of rabble I have got amongst!\"\\nAnd then he glanced at a curious round thing  like an old apple,which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk.\"\\nIt was, however,  not anapple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter, andwas soaked  through with water.\"\\n \"Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I cantalk,\" said the ball,  examining the gilded top.\"\\n\"I am made ofmorocco,\" she said.\"\\n\"I was sewn together by  a young lady, and I have aSpanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look  at me now.I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from the gutterunder  the roof, and I have lain here more than five years, and havebeen thoroughly drenched.\"\\n Believe me, it is a long time for a youngmaiden.\"\\n  The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the moreshe said, the more  clear it became to him that this was the same ball.\"\\n The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin.\"\\n \"Ah,\" she exclaimed, \"here is a gilt top.\"\\n So the top wasbrought again to notice and  honor, but nothing more was heard of thelittle ball.\"\\nHe spoke not a word about his  old love; for that soondied away.\"\\nWhen the beloved object has lain for five years  in agutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know heragain on meeting  her in a dust-bin.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE TRAVELLING COMPANION  by Hans Christian Andersen  POOR John was very sad; for his father was so ill, he had nohope of his recovery.\"\\n John sat alone with the sick man in the littleroom, and the lamp had nearly burnt  out; for it was late in the night.\"\\n \"You have been a good son, John,\" said the sick father, \"and Godwill help you on in  the world.\"\\n He looked at him, as he spoke, withmild, earnest eyes, drew a deep sigh,  and died; yet it appeared asif he still slept.\"\\n John wept bitterly.\"\\nHe had no one in the wide world now; neitherfather, mother, brother,  nor sister.\"\\nPoor John!\"\\nhe knelt down by thebed, kissed his dead father\\'s hand, and  wept many, many bittertears.\"\\nBut at last his eyes closed, and he fell asleep with  his headresting against the hard bedpost.\"\\nThen he dreamed a strange dream;he thought  he saw the sun shining upon him, and his father alive andwell, and even heard him  laughing as he used to do when he was veryhappy.\"\\nA beautiful girl, with a golden crown  on her head, and long,shining hair, gave him her hand; and his father said, \"See what  abride you have won.\"\\nShe is the loveliest maiden on the whole earth.\"\\nThen he awoke,  and all the beautiful things vanished before hiseyes, his father lay dead on the bed,  and he was all alone.\"\\nPoor John!\"\\n During the following week the dead man was buried.\"\\nThe sonwalked behind the coffin  which contained his father, whom he so dearlyloved, and would never again behold.\"\\n He heard the earth fall on thecoffin-lid, and watched it till only a corner remained  in sight, andat last that also disappeared.\"\\nHe felt as if his heart would breakwith  its weight of sorrow, till those who stood round the grave sang apsalm, and the sweet,  holy tones brought tears into his eyes, whichrelieved him.\"\\nThe sun shone brightly  down on the green trees, as if itwould say, \"You must not be so sorrowful, John.\"\\nDo  you see thebeautiful blue sky above you?\"\\nYour father is up there, and he prays tothe  loving Father of all, that you may do well in the future.\"\\n  \"I will always be good,\" said John, \"and then I shall go to bewith my father in heaven.\"\\n What joy it will be when we see each otheragain!\"\\nHow much I shall have to relate to  him, and how many thingshe will be able to explain to me of the delights of heaven,  andteach me as he once did on earth.\"\\nOh, what joy it will be!\"\\n  He pictured it all so plainly to himself, that he smiled evenwhile the tears ran down  his cheeks.\"\\n The little birds in the chestnut-trees twittered, \"Tweet,tweet;\" they were so happy,  although they had seen the funeral; butthey seemed as if they knew that the dead man  was now in heaven, andthat he had wings much larger and more beautiful than their  own; andhe was happy now, because he had been good here on earth, and theywere glad  of it.\"\\nJohn saw them fly away out of the green trees intothe wide world, and he longed  to fly with them; but first he cut out alarge wooden cross, to place on his father\\'s  grave; and when hebrought it there in the evening, he found the grave decked out  withgravel and flowers.\"\\nStrangers had done this; they who had known thegood old father  who was now dead, and who had loved him very much.\"\\n Early the next morning, John packed up his little bundle ofclothes, and placed all  his money, which consisted of fifty dollarsand a few shillings, in his girdle; with  this he determined to try hisfortune in the world.\"\\nBut first he went into the  churchyard; and, byhis father\\'s grave, he offered up a prayer, and said, \"Farewell.\"\\n  As he passed through the fields, all the flowers looked freshand beautiful in the  warm sunshine, and nodded in the wind, as if theywished to say, \"Welcome to the green  wood, where all is fresh andbright.\"\\n  Then John turned to have one more look at the old church, in whichhe had been christened  in his infancy, and where his father hadtaken him every Sunday to hear the service  and join in singing thepsalms.\"\\nAs he looked at the old tower, he espied the ringer  standingat one of the narrow openings, with his little pointed red cap onhis head,  and shading his eyes from the sun with his bent arm.\"\\nJohnnodded farewell to him, and  the little ringer waved his red cap,laid his hand on his heart, and kissed his hand  to him a great manytimes, to show that he felt kindly towards him, and wished him  aprosperous journey.\"\\n John continued his journey, and thought of all the wonderfulthings he should see in  the large, beautiful world, till he foundhimself farther away from home than ever  he had been before.\"\\nHe didnot even know the names of the places he passed through,  and couldscarcely understand the language of the people he met, for he wasfar away,  in a strange land.\"\\nThe first night he slept on a haystack,out in the fields, for there  was no other bed for him; but it seemedto him so nice and comfortable that even a  king need not wish for abetter.\"\\nThe field, the brook, the haystack, with the blue  sky above,formed a beautiful sleeping-room.\"\\nThe green grass, with the little redand  white flowers, was the carpet; the elder-bushes and the hedgesof wild roses looked  like garlands on the walls; and for a bath hecould have the clear, fresh water of  the brook; while the rushes bowedtheir heads to him, to wish him good morning and  good evening.\"\\nThemoon, like a large lamp, hung high up in the blue ceiling, and hehad  no fear of its setting fire to his curtains.\"\\nJohn slept here quitesafely all night;  and when he awoke, the sun was up, and all thelittle birds were singing round him,  \"Good morning, good morning.Are you not up yet?\"\\n  It was Sunday, and the bells were ringing for church.\"\\nAs thepeople went in, John  followed them; he heard God\\'s word, joined insinging the psalms, and listened to the  preacher.\"\\nIt seemed to himjust as if he were in his own church, where he had been  christened,and had sung the psalms with his father.\"\\nOut in the churchyard wereseveral  graves, and on some of them the grass had grown very high.John thought of his father\\'s  grave, which he knew at last would looklike these, as he was not there to weed and  attend to it.\"\\nThen heset to work, pulled up the high grass, raised the wooden crosses  whichhad fallen down, and replaced the wreaths which had been blown awayfrom their  places by the wind, thinking all the time, \"Perhaps someone is doing the same for  my father\\'s grave, as I am not there to doit \"  Outside the church door stood an old beggar, leaning on hiscrutch.\"\\nJohn gave him his  silver shillings, and then he continuedhis journey, feeling lighter and happier than  ever.\"\\nTowards evening,the weather became very stormy, and he hastened on as quickly  as hecould, to get shelter; but it was quite dark by the time he reacheda little lonely  church which stood on a hill.\"\\n\"I will go in here,\"he said, \"and sit down in a corner;  for I am quite tired, and wantrest.\"\\n  So he went in, and seated himself; then he folded his hands, andoffered up his evening  prayer, and was soon fast asleep anddreaming, while the thunder rolled and the  lightning flashedwithout.\"\\nWhen he awoke, it was still night; but the storm hadceased,  and the moon shone in upon him through the windows.\"\\nThen hesaw an open coffin standing  in the centre of the church, whichcontained a dead man, waiting for burial.\"\\nJohn was  not at all timid;he had a good conscience, and he knew also that the dead can  neverinjure any one.\"\\nIt is living wicked men who do harm to others.\"\\nTwosuch wicked  persons stood now by the dead man, who had been brought tothe church to be buried.\"\\n Their evil intentions were to throw thepoor dead body outside the church door, and  not leave him to rest inhis coffin.\"\\n \"Why do you do this?\"\\n asked John, when he saw what they were goingto do; \"it is very  wicked.\"\\nLeave him to rest in peace, in Christ\\'sname.\"\\n  \"Nonsense,\" replied the two dreadful men.\"\\n\"He has cheated us; heowed us money which  he could not pay, and now he is dead we shallnot get a penny; so we mean to have our  revenge, and let him lielike a dog outside the church door.\"\\n  \"I have only fifty dollars,\" said John, \"it is all I possess inthe world, but I will  give it to you if you will promise me faithfullyto leave the dead man in peace.\"\\nI  shall be able to get on withoutthe money; I have strong and healthy limbs, and God  will always helpme.\"\\n  \"Why, of course,\" said the horrid men, \"if you will pay his debtwe will both promise  not to touch him.\"\\nYou may depend upon that;\"and then they took the money he offered  them, laughed at him for hisgood nature, and went their way.\"\\n Then he laid the dead body back in the coffin, folded the hands,and took leave of  it; and went away contentedly through the greatforest.\"\\nAll around him he could see  the prettiest little elves dancingin the moonlight, which shone through the trees.\"\\n They were notdisturbed by his appearance, for they knew he was good and harmlessamong  men.\"\\nThey are wicked people only who can never obtain aglimpse of fairies.\"\\nSome of  them were not taller than the breadth of afinger, and they wore golden combs in their  long, yellow hair.\"\\nTheywere rocking themselves two together on the large dew-drops  with whichthe leaves and the high grass were sprinkled.\"\\nSometimes thedew-drops would  roll away, and then they fell down between the stemsof the long grass, and caused  a great deal of laughing and noise amongthe other little people.\"\\nIt was quite charming  to watch them atplay.\"\\nThen they sang songs, and John remembered that he had learntthose  pretty songs when he was a little boy.\"\\nLarge speckled spiders,with silver crowns on  their heads, were employed to spin suspensionbridges and palaces from one hedge to  another, and when the tiny dropsfell upon them, they glittered in the moonlight like  shining glass.This continued till sunrise.\"\\nThen the little elves crept into  theflower-buds, and the wind seized the bridges and palaces, andfluttered them in  the air like cobwebs.\"\\n As John left the wood, a strong man\\'s voice called after him,\"Hallo, comrade, where  are you travelling?\"\\n  \"Into the wide world,\" he replied; \"I am only a poor lad, I haveneither father nor  mother, but God will help me.\"\\n  \"I am going into the wide world also,\" replied the stranger;\"shall we keep each other  company?\"\\n  \"With all my heart,\" he said, and so they went on together.\"\\nSoonthey began to like  each other very much, for they were both good;but John found out that the stranger  was much more clever thanhimself.\"\\nHe had travelled all over the world, and could  describealmost everything.\"\\nThe sun was high in the heavens when they seatedthemselves  under a large tree to eat their breakfast, and at thesame moment an old woman came  towards them.\"\\nShe was very old andalmost bent double.\"\\nShe leaned upon a stick and  carried on her backa bundle of firewood, which she had collected in the forest; her  apronwas tied round it, and John saw three great stems of fern and somewillow twigs  peeping out.\"\\njust as she came close up to them, herfoot slipped and she fell to the  ground screaming loudly; poor oldwoman, she had broken her leg!\"\\nJohn proposed directly  that they shouldcarry the old woman home to her cottage; but the stranger opened  hisknapsack and took out a box, in which he said he had a salve thatwould quickly  make her leg well and strong again, so that she would beable to walk home herself,  as if her leg had never been broken.\"\\nAndall that he would ask in return was the three  fern stems which shecarried in her apron.\"\\n \"That is rather too high a price,\" said the old woman, nodding herhead quite strangely.\"\\n She did not seem at all inclined to part withthe fern stems.\"\\nHowever, it was not very  agreeable to lie there with abroken leg, so she gave them to him; and such was the  power of theointment, that no sooner had he rubbed her leg with it than the oldmother  rose up and walked even better than she had done before.\"\\nButthen this wonderful  ointment could not be bought at a chemist\\'s.\"\\n \"What can you want with those three fern rods?\"\\n asked John ofhis fellow-traveller.\"\\n \"Oh, they will make capital brooms,\" said he; \"and I like thembecause I have strange  whims sometimes.\"\\n Then they walked ontogether for a long distance.\"\\n \"How dark the sky is becoming,\" said John; \"and look at thosethick, heavy clouds.\"\\n  \"Those are not clouds,\" replied his fellow-traveller; \"they aremountains- large lofty  mountains- on the tops of which we should beabove the clouds, in the pure, free air.\"\\n Believe me, it isdelightful to ascend so high, tomorrow we shall be there.\"\\n But  themountains were not so near as they appeared; they had to travel awhole day before  they reached them, and pass through black forests andpiles of rock as large as a town.\"\\n The journey had been so fatiguingthat John and his fellow-traveller stopped to rest  at a roadsideinn, so that they might gain strength for their journey on the morrow.In  the large public room of the inn a great many persons wereassembled to see a comedy  performed by dolls.\"\\nThe showman had justerected his little theatre, and the people  were sitting round the roomto witness the performance.\"\\nRight in front, in the very  best place,sat a stout butcher, with a great bull-dog by his side who seemed verymuch  inclined to bite.\"\\nHe sat staring with all his eyes, and so indeeddid every one else  in the room.\"\\nAnd then the play began.\"\\nIt was apretty piece, with a king and a queen  in it, who sat on a beautifulthrone, and had gold crowns on their heads.\"\\nThe trains  to theirdresses were very long, according to the fashion; while theprettiest of wooden  dolls, with glass eyes and large mustaches,stood at the doors, and opened and shut  them, that the fresh air mightcome into the room.\"\\nIt was a very pleasant play, not  at allmournful; but just as the queen stood up and walked across thestage, the great  bull-dog, who should have been held back by hismaster, made a spring forward, and  caught the queen in the teeth bythe slender wrist, so that it snapped in two.\"\\nThis  was a very dreadfuldisaster.\"\\nThe poor man, who was exhibiting the dolls, was  muchannoyed, and quite sad about his queen; she was the prettiest dollhe had, and  the bull-dog had broken her head and shoulders off.\"\\nButafter all the people were gone  away, the stranger, who came with John,said that he could soon set her to rights.\"\\n And then he brought out hisbox and rubbed the doll with some of the salve with which  he had curedthe old woman when she broke her leg.\"\\nAs soon as this was done thedoll\\'s  back became quite right again; her head and shoulders werefixed on, and she could  even move her limbs herself: there was nowno occasion to pull the wires, for the doll  acted just like a livingcreature, excepting that she could not speak.\"\\nThe man to whom  the showbelonged was quite delighted at having a doll who could dance ofherself  without being pulled by the wires; none of the other dollscould do this.\"\\n During the night, when all the people at the inn were gone to bed,some one was heard  to sigh so deeply and painfully, and the sighingcontinued for so long a time, that  every one got up to see whatcould be the matter.\"\\nThe showman went at once to his little  theatreand found that it proceeded from the dolls, who all lay on the floorsighing  piteously, and staring with their glass eyes; they allwanted to be rubbed with the  ointment, so that, like the queen, theymight be able to move of themselves.\"\\nThe queen  threw herself on herknees, took off her beautiful crown, and, holding it in her  hand,cried, \"Take this from me, but do rub my husband and his courtiers.\"\\n  The poor man who owned the theatre could scarcely refrain fromweeping; he was so sorry  that he could not help them.\"\\nThen heimmediately spoke to John\\'s comrade, and promised  him all the money hemight receive at the next evening\\'s performance, if he would  onlyrub the ointment on four or five of his dolls.\"\\nBut thefellow-traveller said he  did not require anything in return, exceptingthe sword which the showman wore by his  side.\"\\nAs soon as he receivedthe sword he anointed six of the dolls with the ointment,  and theywere able immediately to dance so gracefully that all the living girlsin the  room could not help joining in the dance.\"\\nThe coachman dancedwith the cook, and the  waiters with the chambermaids, and all thestrangers joined; even the tongs and the  fire-shovel made anattempt, but they fell down after the first jump.\"\\nSo after all  itwas a very merry night.\"\\nThe next morning John and his companion leftthe inn to  continue their journey through the great pine-forests andover the high mountains.\"\\n They arrived at last at such a great heightthat towns and villages lay beneath them,  and the church steepleslooked like little specks between the green trees.\"\\nThey could  seefor miles round, far away to places they had never visited, and Johnsaw more of  the beautiful world than he had ever known before.\"\\nThe sunshone brightly in the blue  firmament above, and through the clearmountain air came the sound of the huntsman\\'s  horn, and the soft,sweet notes brought tears into his eyes, and he could not  helpexclaiming, \"How good and loving God is to give us all this beauty andloveliness  in the world to make us happy!\"\\n  His fellow-traveller stood by with folded hands, gazing on thedark wood and the towns  bathed in the warm sunshine.\"\\nAt this momentthere sounded over their heads sweet music.\"\\n They looked up, anddiscovered a large white swan hovering in the air, and singing  asnever bird sang before.\"\\nBut the song soon became weaker and weaker,the bird\\'s head  drooped, and he sunk slowly down, and lay dead attheir feet.\"\\n \"It is a beautiful bird,\" said the traveller, \"and these largewhite wings are worth  a great deal of money.\"\\nI will take them with me.You see now that a sword will be very  useful.\"\\n  So he cut off the wings of the dead swan with one blow, andcarried them away with  him.\"\\n They now continued their journey over the mountains for manymiles, till they at length  reached a large city, containing hundredsof towers, that shone in the sunshine like  silver.\"\\nIn the midst of thecity stood a splendid marble palace, roofed with pure red  gold, inwhich dwelt the king.\"\\nJohn and his companion would not go into thetown  immediately; so they stopped at an inn outside the town, tochange their clothes; for  they wished to appear respectable as theywalked through the streets.\"\\nThe landlord  told them that the king was avery good man, who never injured any one: but as to his  daughter,\"Heaven defend us!\"\\n  She was indeed a wicked princess.\"\\nShe possessed beauty enough-nobody could be more  elegant or prettier than she was; but what ofthat?\"\\nfor she was a wicked witch; and  in consequence of her conductmany noble young princes had lost their lives.\"\\nAny one  was atliberty to make her an offer; were he a prince or a beggar, itmattered not to  her.\"\\nShe would ask him to guess three things which shehad just thought of, and if  he succeed, he was to marry her, and beking over all the land when her father died;  but if he could not guessthese three things, then she ordered him to be hanged or  to have hishead cut off.\"\\nThe old king, her father, was very much grieved at herconduct,  but he could not prevent her from being so wicked, because heonce said he would have  nothing more to do with her lovers; shemight do as she pleased.\"\\nEach prince who came  and tried the threeguesses, so that he might marry the princess, had been unable tofind  them out, and had been hanged or beheaded.\"\\nThey had all beenwarned in time, and might  have left her alone, if they would.\"\\nTheold king became at last so distressed at all  these dreadfulcircumstances, that for a whole day every year he and his soldiersknelt  and prayed that the princess might become good; but shecontinued as wicked as ever.\"\\n The old women who drank brandy wouldcolor it quite black before they drank it, to  show how they mourned;and what more could they do?\"\\n \"What a horrible princess!\"\\n said John; \"she ought to be wellflogged.\"\\nIf I were the  old king, I would have her punished in someway.\"\\n  Just then they heard the people outside shouting, \"Hurrah!\"\\n and,looking out, they  saw the princess passing by; and she was really sobeautiful that everybody forgot  her wickedness, and shouted\"Hurrah!\"\\n Twelve lovely maidens in white silk dresses,  holdinggolden tulips in their hands, rode by her side on coal-black horses.The  princess herself had a snow-white steed, decked with diamondsand rubies.\"\\nHer dress  was of cloth of gold, and the whip she held inher hand looked like a sunbeam.\"\\nThe  golden crown on her head glitteredlike the stars of heaven, and her mantle was formed  of thousands ofbutterflies\\' wings sewn together.\"\\nYet she herself was more  beautifulthan all.\"\\n When John saw her, his face became as red as a drop of blood,and he could scarcely  utter a word.\"\\nThe princess looked exactly likethe beautiful lady with the golden crown,  of whom he had dreamed onthe night his father died.\"\\nShe appeared to him so lovely  that he couldnot help loving her.\"\\n \"It could not be true,\" he thought, \"that she was really awicked witch, who ordered  people to be hanged or beheaded, if theycould not guess her thoughts.\"\\nEvery one has  permission to go and askher hand, even the poorest beggar.\"\\nI shall pay a visit to  the palace,\"he said; \"I must go, for I cannot help myself.\"\\n  Then they all advised him not to attempt it; for he would besure to share the same  fate as the rest.\"\\nHis fellow-traveller alsotried to persuade him against it; but John  seemed quite sure ofsuccess.\"\\nHe brushed his shoes and his coat, washed his face and  hishands, combed his soft flaxen hair, and then went out alone into thetown, and walked  to the palace.\"\\n \"Come in,\" said the king, as John knocked at the door.\"\\nJohn openedit, and the old  king, in a dressing gown and embroidered slippers,came towards him.\"\\nHe had the crown  on his head, carried his sceptre inone hand, and the orb in the other.\"\\n\"Wait a bit,\"  said he, and heplaced the orb under his arm, so that he could offer the other hand  toJohn; but when he found that John was another suitor, he began to weepso violently,  that both the sceptre and the orb fell to the floor, andhe was obliged to wipe his  eyes with his dressing gown.\"\\nPoor old king!\"\\nLet her alone,\" he said; \"you will fare  as badly as all the others.Come, I will show you.\"\\n Then he led him out into the  princess\\'spleasure gardens, and there he saw a frightful sight.\"\\nOn every treehung  three or four king\\'s sons who had wooed the princess, but had notbeen able to guess  the riddles she gave them.\"\\nTheir skeletonsrattled in every breeze, so that the  terrified birds never dared toventure into the garden.\"\\nAll the flowers were supported  by human bonesinstead of sticks, and human skulls in the flower-pots grinnedhorribly.\"\\n It was really a doleful garden for a princess.\"\\n\"Do you seeall this?\"\\n said the old  king; \"your fate will be the same as those whoare here, therefore do not attempt it.\"\\n You really make me veryunhappy,- I take these things to heart so very much.\"\\n  John kissed the good old king\\'s hand, and said he was sure itwould be all right, for  he was quite enchanted with the beautifulprincess.\"\\nThen the princess herself came  riding into the palace yardwith all her ladies, and he wished her \"Good morning.\"\\n  She lookedwonderfully fair and lovely when she offered her hand to John, andhe loved  her more than ever.\"\\nHow could she be a wicked witch, as allthe people asserted?\"\\nHe  accompanied her into the hall, and thelittle pages offered them gingerbread nuts and  sweetmeats, but the oldking was so unhappy he could eat nothing, and besides,  gingerbreadnuts were too hard for him.\"\\nIt was decided that John should come tothe  palace the next day, when the judges and the whole of thecounsellors would be present,  to try if he could guess the firstriddle.\"\\nIf he succeeded, he would have to come a  second time; but ifnot, he would lose his life,- and no one had ever been able to  guesseven one.\"\\nHowever, John was not at all anxious about the result of histrial;  on the contrary, he was very merry.\"\\nHe thought only of thebeautiful princess, and  believed that in some way he should have help,but how he knew not, and did not like  to think about it; so hedanced along the high-road as he went back to the inn, where  he hadleft his fellow-traveller waiting for him.\"\\nJohn could not refrain fromtelling  him how gracious the princess had been, and how beautifulshe looked.\"\\nHe longed for  the next day so much, that he might go tothe palace and try his luck at guessing the  riddles.\"\\nBut his comradeshook his head, and looked very mournful.\"\\n\"I do so wish you  to dowell,\" said he; \"we might have continued together much longer, and nowI am likely  to lose you; you poor dear John!\"\\nI could shed tears, but Iwill not make you unhappy  on the last night we may be together.\"\\nWewill be merry, really merry this evening;  to-morrow, after you aregone, shall be able to weep undisturbed.\"\\n  It was very quickly known among the inhabitants of the town thatanother suitor had  arrived for the princess, and there was greatsorrow in consequence.\"\\nThe theatre  remained closed, the women who soldsweetmeats tied crape round the sugar-sticks, and  the king and thepriests were on their knees in the church.\"\\nThere was a greatlamentation,  for no one expected John to succeed better than those whohad been suitors before.\"\\n In the evening John\\'s comrade prepared a large bowl of punch,and said, \"Now let us  be merry, and drink to the health of theprincess.\"\\n But after drinking two glasses,  John became so sleepy, thathe could not keep his eyes open, and fell fast asleep.\"\\n Then hisfellow-traveller lifted him gently out of his chair, and laid him onthe bed;  and as soon as it was quite dark, he took the two large wingswhich he had cut from  the dead swan, and tied them firmly to his ownshoulders.\"\\nThen he put into his pocket  the largest of the three rodswhich he had obtained from the old woman who had fallen  and broken herleg.\"\\nAfter this he opened the window, and flew away over the  town,straight towards the palace, and seated himself in a corner, under thewindow  which looked into the bedroom of the princess.\"\\n The town was perfectly still when the clocks struck a quarter totwelve.\"\\nPresently  the window opened, and the princess, who had largeblack wings to her shoulders, and  a long white mantle, flew awayover the city towards a high mountain.\"\\nThe  fellow-traveller, who hadmade himself invisible, so that she could not possibly see  him, flewafter her through the air, and whipped the princess with his rod, sothat  the blood came whenever he struck her.\"\\nAh, it was a strangeflight through the air!\"\\n The wind caught her mantle, so that itspread out on all sides, like the large sail  of a ship, and the moonshone through it.\"\\n\"How it hails, to be sure!\"\\n said the princess,  ateach blow she received from the rod; and it served her right to bewhipped.\"\\n At last she reached the side of the mountain, and knocked.\"\\nThemountain opened with  a noise like the roll of thunder, and theprincess went in.\"\\nThe traveller followed  her; no one could see him, ashe had made himself invisible.\"\\nThey went through a long,  wide passage.A thousand gleaming spiders ran here and there on the walls, causingthem  to glitter as if they were illuminated with fire.\"\\nThey nextentered a large hall built  of silver and gold.\"\\nLarge red and blueflowers shone on the walls, looking like  sunflowers in size, but noone could dare to pluck them, for the stems were hideous  poisonoussnakes, and the flowers were flames of fire, darting out of theirjaws.\"\\n Shining glow-worms covered the ceiling, and sky-blue batsflapped their transparent  wings.\"\\nAltogether the place had afrightful appearance.\"\\nIn the middle of the floor  stood a thronesupported by four skeleton horses, whose harness had been made  byfiery-red spiders.\"\\nThe throne itself was made of milk-white glass, andthe cushions  were little black mice, each biting the other\\'s tail.Over it hung a canopy of  rose-colored spider\\'s webs, spotted withthe prettiest little green flies, which  sparkled like precious stones.On the throne sat an old magician with a crown on his  ugly head, and asceptre in his hand.\"\\nHe kissed the princess on the forehead, seatedher  by his side on the splendid throne, and then the musiccommenced.\"\\nGreat black  grasshoppers played the mouth organ, and theowl struck herself on the body instead  of a drum.\"\\nIt was altogethera ridiculous concert.\"\\nLittle black goblins with false  lights intheir caps danced about the hall; but no one could see thetraveller, and  he had placed himself just behind the throne where hecould see and hear everything.\"\\n The courtiers who came in afterwardslooked noble and grand; but any one with common  sense could see whatthey really were, only broomsticks, with cabbages for heads.\"\\n Themagician had given them life, and dressed them in embroidered robes.It answered  very well, as they were only wanted for show.\"\\nAfterthere had been a little dancing,  the princess told the magician thatshe had a new suitor, and asked him what she could  think of for thesuitor to guess when he came to the castle the next morning.\"\\n \"Listen to what I say,\" said the magician, \"you must choosesomething very easy, he  is less likely to guess it then.\"\\nThink ofone of your shoes, he will never imagine  it is that.\"\\nThen cut his headoff; and mind you do not forget to bring his eyes with  you to-morrownight, that I may eat them.\"\\n  The princess curtsied low, and said she would not forget the eyes.\"\\n The magician then opened the mountain and she flew home again, butthe traveller  followed and flogged her so much with the rod, thatshe sighed quite deeply about the  heavy hail-storm, and made as muchhaste as she could to get back to her bedroom through  the window.The traveller then returned to the inn where John still slept, tookoff  his wings and laid down on the bed, for he was very tired.\"\\nEarlyin the morning John  awoke, and when his fellow-traveller got up, hesaid that he had a very wonderful dream  about the princess and hershoe, he therefore advised John to ask her if she had not  thought ofher shoe.\"\\nOf course the traveller knew this from what the magicianin the  mountain had said.\"\\n \"I may as well say that as anything,\" said John.\"\\n\"Perhaps yourdream may come true;  still I will say farewell, for if I guess wrong Ishall never see you again.\"\\n  Then they embraced each other, and John went into the town andwalked to the palace.\"\\n The great hall was full of people, and thejudges sat in arm-chairs, with eider-down  cushions to rest their headsupon, because they had so much to think of.\"\\nThe old king  stood near,wiping his eyes with his white pocket-handkerchief.\"\\nWhen theprincess  entered, she looked even more beautiful than she had appearedthe day before, and  greeted every one present most gracefully; butto John she gave her hand, and said,  \"Good morning to you.\"\\n  Now came the time for John to guess what she was thinking of;and oh, how kindly she  looked at him as she spoke.\"\\nBut when he utteredthe single word shoe, she turned as  pale as a ghost; all her wisdomcould not help her, for he had guessed rightly.\"\\nOh,  how pleased theold king was!\"\\nIt was quite amusing to see how he capered about.\"\\nAllthe  people clapped their hands, both on his account and John\\'s, whohad guessed rightly  the first time.\"\\nHis fellow-traveller was gladalso, when he heard how successful John  had been.\"\\nBut John foldedhis hands, and thanked God, who, he felt quite sure, would  help himagain; and he knew he had to guess twice more.\"\\nThe evening passedpleasantly  like the one preceding.\"\\nWhile John slept, his companionflew behind the princess to  the mountain, and flogged her evenharder than before; this time he had taken two rods  with him.\"\\nNo onesaw him go in with her, and he heard all that was said.\"\\nThe princessthis  time was to think of a glove, and he told John as if he had againheard it in a dream.\"\\n The next day, therefore, he was able to guesscorrectly the second time, and it caused  great rejoicing at thepalace.\"\\nThe whole court jumped about as they had seen the king  dothe day before, but the princess lay on the sofa, and would not saya single word.\"\\n All now depended upon John.\"\\nIf he only guessedrightly the third time, he would marry  the princess, and reign overthe kingdom after the death of the old king: but if he  failed, hewould lose his life, and the magician would have his beautiful blueeyes.\"\\n That evening John said his prayers and went to bed very early,and soon fell asleep  calmly.\"\\nBut his companion tied on his wings tohis shoulders, took three rods, and,  with his sword at his side,flew to the palace.\"\\nIt was a very dark night, and so stormy  that thetiles flew from the roofs of the houses, and the trees in the gardenupon which  the skeletons hung bent themselves like reeds before thewind.\"\\nThe lightning flashed,  and the thunder rolled in onelong-continued peal all night.\"\\nThe window of the castle  opened, andthe princess flew out.\"\\nShe was pale as death, but she laughed at thestorm  as if it were not bad enough.\"\\nHer white mantle fluttered inthe wind like a large sail,  and the traveller flogged her with thethree rods till the blood trickled down, and  at last she couldscarcely fly; she contrived, however, to reach the mountain.\"\\n\"What  ahail-storm!\"\\n she said, as she entered; \"I have never been out insuch weather as this.\"\\n  \"Yes, there may be too much of a good thing sometimes,\" said themagician.\"\\n Then the princess told him that John had guessed rightly thesecond time, and if he  succeeded the next morning, he would win, andshe could never come to the mountain  again, or practice magic as shehad done, and therefore she was quite unhappy.\"\\n\"I will  find outsomething for you to think of which he will never guess, unless heis a greater  conjuror than myself.\"\\nBut now let us be merry.\"\\n  Then he took the princess by both hands, and they danced withall the little goblins  and Jack-o\\'-lanterns in the room.\"\\nThe redspiders sprang here and there on the walls  quite as merrily, and theflowers of fire appeared as if they were throwing out sparks.\"\\n Theowl beat the drum, the crickets whistled and the grasshoppers playedthe  mouth-organ.\"\\nIt was a very ridiculous ball.\"\\nAfter they haddanced enough, the princess  was obliged to go home, for fear sheshould be missed at the palace.\"\\nThe magician  offered to go with her,that they might be company to each other on the way.\"\\nThen they  flewaway through the bad weather, and the traveller followed them, andbroke his three  rods across their shoulders.\"\\nThe magician had neverbeen out in such a hail-storm as  this.\"\\nJust by the palace the magicianstopped to wish the princess farewell, and to  whisper in her ear,\"To-morrow think of my head.\"\\n  But the traveller heard it, and just as the princess slippedthrough the window into  her bedroom, and the magician turned roundto fly back to the mountain, he seized him  by the long black beard,and with his sabre cut off the wicked conjuror\\'s head just  behindthe shoulders, so that he could not even see who it was.\"\\nHe threwthe body into  the sea to the fishes, and after dipping the head intothe water, he tied it up in  a silk handkerchief, took it with him tothe inn, and then went to bed.\"\\nThe next morning  he gave John thehandkerchief, and told him not to untie it till the princess asked  himwhat she was thinking of.\"\\nThere were so many people in the greathall of the palace  that they stood as thick as radishes tiedtogether in a bundle.\"\\nThe council sat in  their arm-chairs with thewhite cushions.\"\\nThe old king wore new robes, and the golden  crownand sceptre had been polished up so that he looked quite smart.\"\\nButthe princess  was very pale, and wore a black dress as if she weregoing to a funeral.\"\\n \"What have I thought of?\"\\n asked the princess, of John.\"\\nHeimmediately untied the  handkerchief, and was himself quitefrightened when he saw the head of the ugly  magician.\"\\nEvery oneshuddered, for it was terrible to look at; but the princess sat  like astatue, and could not utter a single word.\"\\nAt length she rose and gaveJohn her  hand, for he had guessed rightly.\"\\n She looked at no one, but sighed deeply, and said, \"You are mymaster now; this evening  our marriage must take place.\"\\n  \"I am very pleased to hear it,\" said the old king.\"\\n\"It is justwhat I wish.\"\\n  Then all the people shouted \"Hurrah.\"\\n The band played music in thestreets, the bells  rang, and the cake-women took the black crape offthe sugar-sticks.\"\\nThere was universal  joy.\"\\nThree oxen, stuffed withducks and chickens, were roasted whole in the  market-place, whereevery one might help himself to a slice.\"\\nThe fountains spouted  forththe most delicious wine, and whoever bought a penny loaf at thebaker\\'s received  six large buns, full of raisins, as a present.\"\\nIn theevening the whole town was  illuminated.\"\\nThe soldiers fired offcannons, and the boys let off crackers.\"\\nThere was  eating and drinking,dancing and jumping everywhere.\"\\nIn the palace, the high-born  gentlemenand beautiful ladies danced with each other, and they could be heardat a  great distance singing the following song:-  \"Here are maidens, young and fair,  Dancing in the summer air;  Like two spinning-wheels at play,  Pretty maidens dance away\\ufffeDance the spring and summer through  Till the sole falls from your shoe.\"\\n  But the princess was still a witch, and she could not love John.His fellow-traveller  had thought of that, so he gave John threefeathers out of the swan\\'s wings, and a  little bottle with a few dropsin it.\"\\nHe told him to place a large bath full of water  by theprincess\\'s bed, and put the feathers and the drops into it.\"\\nThen, atthe moment  she was about to get into bed, he must give her a littlepush, so that she might fall  into the water, and then dip her threetimes.\"\\nThis would destroy the power of the  magician, and she wouldlove him very much.\"\\nJohn did all that his companion told him  to do.The princess shrieked aloud when he dipped her under the water thefirst time,  and struggled under his hands in the form of a great blackswan with fiery eyes.\"\\nAs  she rose the second time from the water,the swan had become white, with a black ring  round its neck.\"\\nJohnallowed the water to close once more over the bird, and at the  sametime it changed into a most beautiful princess.\"\\nShe was more lovelyeven than  before, and thanked him, while her eyes sparkled with tears,for having broken the  spell of the magician.\"\\nThe next day, the kingcame with the whole court to offer their  congratulations, and stayedtill quite late.\"\\nLast of all came the travelling companion;  he had hisstaff in his hand and his knapsack on his back.\"\\nJohn kissed him manytimes  and told him he must not go, he must remain with him, for he wasthe cause of all his  good fortune.\"\\nBut the traveller shook his head,and said gently and kindly, \"No: my  time is up now; I have only paidmy debt to you.\"\\nDo you remember the dead man whom  the bad peoplewished to throw out of his coffin?\"\\nYou gave all you possessed thathe  might rest in his grave; I am that man.\"\\n As he said this, hevanished.\"\\n The wedding festivities lasted a whole month.\"\\nJohn and hisprincess loved each other  dearly, and the old king lived to see many ahappy day, when he took their little  children on his knees and letthem play with his sceptre.\"\\nAnd John became king over  the wholecountry.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE UGLY DUCKLING  by Hans Christian Andersen  IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the goldencorn, the green oats, and  the haystacks piled up in the meadows lookedbeautiful.\"\\nThe stork walking about on  his long red legs chattered inthe Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his  mother.\"\\nThecorn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midstof  which were deep pools.\"\\nIt was, indeed, delightful to walk aboutin the country.\"\\nIn  a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-houseclose by a deep river, and from the house  down to the water sidegrew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of  them alittle child could stand upright.\"\\nThe spot was as wild as the centreof a thick  wood.\"\\nIn this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watchingfor her young brood to  hatch; she was beginning to get tired of hertask, for the little ones were a long  time coming out of their shells,and she seldom had any visitors.\"\\nThe other ducks liked  much betterto swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and situnder  a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her.\"\\nAt length one shellcracked, and then another,  and from each egg came a living creaturethat lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\"\\n  \"Quack, quack,\" said themother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and  lookedabout them on every side at the large green leaves.\"\\nTheir motherallowed them  to look as much as they liked, because green is goodfor the eyes.\"\\n\"How large the world  is,\" said the young ducks, whenthey found how much more room they now had than while  they were insidethe egg-shell.\"\\n\"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\"\\n asked  themother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyondthat to the  parson\\'s field, but I have never ventured to such adistance.\"\\nAre you all out?\"\\n she  continued, rising; \"No, I declare, thelargest egg lies there still.\"\\nI wonder how long  this is to last, Iam quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\"\\n \"Well, how are you getting on?\"\\n asked an old duck, who paid hera visit.\"\\n \"One egg is not hatched yet,\" said the duck, \"it will not break.But just look at all  the others, are they not the prettiest littleducklings you ever saw?\"\\nThey are the  image of their father, who isso unkind, he never comes to see.\"\\n  \"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I haveno doubt it is a turkey\\'s  egg.\"\\nI was persuaded to hatch some once, andafter all my care and trouble with the  young ones, they were afraid ofthe water.\"\\nI quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose.\"\\n I could notget them to venture in.\"\\nLet me look at the egg.\"\\nYes, that is aturkey\\'s  egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the otherchildren to swim.\"\\n  \"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the duck;\"as I have sat so  long already, a few days will be nothing.\"\\n  \"Please yourself,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\"\\n At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying,\"Peep, peep.\"\\n It was  very large and ugly.\"\\nThe duck stared at it andexclaimed, \"It is very large and not  at all like the others.\"\\nIwonder if it really is a turkey.\"\\nWe shall soon find it out,  howeverwhen we go to the water.\"\\nIt must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\\n  On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shonebrightly on the green  burdock leaves, so the mother duck took heryoung brood down to the water, and jumped  in with a splash.\"\\n\"Quack,quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings  jumpedin.\"\\nThe water closed over their heads, but they came up again in aninstant,  and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddlingunder them as easily as possible,  and the ugly duckling was also inthe water swimming with them.\"\\n \"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses hislegs, and how upright  he holds himself!\"\\nHe is my own child, and heis not so very ugly after all if you look  at him properly.\"\\nQuack,quack!\"\\ncome with me now, I will take you into grand society,  andintroduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or youmay be trodden  upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\\n  When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, twofamilies were  fighting for an eel\\'s head, which, after all, wascarried off by the cat.\"\\n\"See, children,  that is the way of the world,\"said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would  have likedthe eel\\'s head herself.\"\\n\"Come, now, use your legs, and let me seehow well  you can behave.\"\\nYou must bow your heads prettily to thatold duck yonder; she is the  highest born of them all, and hasSpanish blood, therefore, she is well off.\"\\nDon\\'t  you see she has a redflag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great  honorfor a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as shecan be  recognized both by man and beast.\"\\nCome, now, don\\'t turn yourtoes, a well-bred duckling  spreads his feet wide apart, just likehis father and mother, in this way; now bend  your neck, and say\\'quack.\\'\"  The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, andsaid, \"Look, here  comes another brood, as if there were not enoughof us already!\"\\nand what a queer looking  object one of them is; wedon\\'t want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in  the neck.\"\\n \"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\\n  \"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"andtherefore he must be  turned out.\"\\n  \"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with therag on her leg,  \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve hima little.\"\\n  \"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is notpretty; but he has  a very good disposition, and swims as well oreven better than the others.\"\\nI think  he will grow up pretty, andperhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg,  and thereforehis figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neckand  smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore notof so much consequence.\"\\n I think he will grow up strong, and able totake care of himself.\"\\n  \"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck.\"\\n\"Nowmake yourself at  home, and if you can find an eel\\'s head, you canbring it to me.\"\\n  And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling,who had crept out of  his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, wasbitten and pushed and made fun of, not  only by the ducks, but by allthe poultry.\"\\n\"He is too big,\" they all said, and the  turkey cock,who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himselfreally  an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail,and flew at the duckling,  and became quite red in the head withpassion, so that the poor little thing did not  know where to go, andwas quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by  the wholefarmyard.\"\\nSo it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse.The poor  duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers andsisters were unkind to  him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, Iwish the cat would get you,\" and his  mother said she wished he hadnever been born.\"\\nThe ducks pecked him, the chickens beat  him, andthe girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet.\"\\nSo at last heran away,  frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew overthe palings.\"\\n \"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said.\"\\nSo he closedhis eyes, and flew  still farther, until he came out on a large moor,inhabited by wild ducks.\"\\nHere he  remained the whole night, feelingvery tired and sorrowful.\"\\n In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they staredat their new comrade.\"\\n \"What sort of a duck are you?\"\\n they all said,coming round him.\"\\n He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did notreply to their question.\"\\n \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wildducks, \"but that will not matter if you do  not want to marry one ofour family.\"\\n  Poor thing!\"\\nhe had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted waspermission to lie among  the rushes, and drink some of the water on themoor.\"\\nAfter he had been on the moor  two days, there came two wildgeese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out  of the egglong, and were very saucy.\"\\n\"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to theduckling,  \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well.\"\\nWill you gowith us, and become a bird  of passage?\"\\nNot far from here is anothermoor, in which there are some pretty wild  geese, all unmarried.\"\\nItis a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly  as you are.\"\\n  \"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell deadamong the rushes,  and the water was tinged with blood.\"\\n\"Pop, pop,\"echoed far and wide in the distance,  and whole flocks of wild geeserose up from the rushes.\"\\nThe sound continued from every  direction, forthe sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated onbranches  of trees, overlooking the rushes.\"\\nThe blue smoke from theguns rose like clouds over  the dark trees, and as it floated awayacross the water, a number of sporting dogs  bounded in among therushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went.\"\\nHow they  terrifiedthe poor duckling!\"\\nHe turned away his head to hide it under hiswing, and  at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite nearhim.\"\\nHis jaws were open,  his tongue hung from his mouth, and hiseyes glared fearfully.\"\\nHe thrust his nose close  to the duckling,showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went intothe  water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"howthankful I am for being  so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\"\\n Andso he lay quite still, while the shot rattled  through the rushes,and gun after gun was fired over him.\"\\nIt was late in the day  beforeall became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare tomove.\"\\nHe  waited quietly for several hours, and then, after lookingcarefully around him,  hastened away from the moor as fast as he could.He ran over field and meadow till  a storm arose, and he could hardlystruggle against it.\"\\nTowards evening, he reached  a poor little cottagethat seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because  it couldnot decide on which side to fall first.\"\\nThe storm continued soviolent, that  the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by thecottage, and then he noticed that  the door was not quite closed inconsequence of one of the hinges having given way.\"\\n There was thereforea narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip  through,which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night.\"\\nA woman, atom  cat, and a hen lived in this cottage.\"\\nThe tom cat, whom themistress called, \"My little  son,\" was a great favorite; he could raisehis back, and purr, and could even throw  out sparks from his fur if itwere stroked the wrong way.\"\\nThe hen had very short legs,  so she wascalled \"Chickie short legs.\"\\n She laid good eggs, and her mistressloved her  as if she had been her own child.\"\\nIn the morning, thestrange visitor was discovered,  and the tom cat began to purr, and thehen to cluck.\"\\n \"What is that noise about?\"\\n said the old woman, looking roundthe room, but her sight  was not very good; therefore, when she saw theduckling she thought it must be a fat  duck, that had strayed fromhome.\"\\n\"Oh what a prize!\"\\n she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not  a drake, forthen I shall have some duck\\'s eggs.\"\\nI must wait and see.\"\\n So theduckling  was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but therewere no eggs.\"\\nNow the tom  cat was the master of the house, and the henwas mistress, and they always said, \"We  and the world,\" for theybelieved themselves to be half the world, and the better half  too.\"\\nTheduckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on thesubject,  but the hen would not listen to such doubts.\"\\n\"Can you layeggs?\"\\n she asked.\"\\n\"No.\"\\n \"Then  have the goodness to hold yourtongue.\"\\n \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw  out sparks?\"\\n saidthe tom cat.\"\\n\"No.\"\\n \"Then you have no right to express an opinionwhen  sensible people are speaking.\"\\n So the duckling sat in a corner,feeling very low  spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air cameinto the room through the open door,  and then he began to feel sucha great longing for a swim on the water, that he could  not helptelling the hen.\"\\n \"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen.\"\\n\"You have nothing else to do,therefore you have  foolish fancies.\"\\nIf you could purr or lay eggs,they would pass away.\"\\n  \"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said theduckling, \"and so  refreshing to feel it close over your head, whileyou dive down to the bottom.\"\\n  \"Delightful, indeed!\"\\n said the hen, \"why you must be crazy!\"\\nAskthe cat, he is the  cleverest animal I know, ask him how he wouldlike to swim about on the water, or to  dive under it, for I will notspeak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman\\ufffethere isno one in the world more clever than she is.\"\\nDo you think she wouldlike to  swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\\n  \"You don\\'t understand me,\" said the duckling.\"\\n \"We don\\'t understand you?\"\\nWho can understand you, I wonder?\"\\nDo youconsider yourself  more clever than the cat, or the old woman?\"\\nI willsay nothing of myself.\"\\nDon\\'t imagine  such nonsense, child, and thankyour good fortune that you have been received here.\"\\n Are you not in awarm room, and in society from which you may learn something.\"\\nButyou  are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable.\"\\nBelieveme, I speak only for  your own good.\"\\nI may tell you unpleasanttruths, but that is a proof of my friendship.\"\\n I advise you, therefore,to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\\n  \"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\"\\n \"Yes, do,\" said the hen.\"\\nSo the duckling left the cottage, andsoon found water on  which it could swim and dive, but was avoided byall other animals, because of its  ugly appearance.\"\\nAutumn came, andthe leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold.\"\\n then, as winterapproached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them inthe  cold air.\"\\nThe clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low inthe sky, and the  raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\"\\n Itmade one shiver with cold to look  at him.\"\\nAll this was very sad forthe poor little duckling.\"\\nOne evening, just as the  sun set amidradiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of  thebushes.\"\\nThe duckling had never seen any like them before.\"\\nThey wereswans, and they  curved their graceful necks, while their softplumage shown with dazzling whiteness.\"\\n They uttered a singular cry, asthey spread their glorious wings and flew away from  those cold regionsto warmer countries across the sea.\"\\nAs they mounted higher andhigher  in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strangesensation as he watched them.\"\\n He whirled himself in the water like awheel, stretched out his neck towards them,  and uttered a cry sostrange that it frightened himself.\"\\nCould he ever forget  thosebeautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight,he dived  under the water, and rose again almost beside himself withexcitement.\"\\nHe knew not  the names of these birds, nor where they hadflown, but he felt towards them as he  had never felt for any otherbird in the world.\"\\nHe was not envious of these beautiful  creatures,but wished to be as lovely as they.\"\\nPoor ugly creature, how gladlyhe would  have lived even with the ducks had they only given himencouragement.\"\\nThe winter grew  colder and colder; he was obliged toswim about on the water to keep it from freezing,  but every nightthe space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.\"\\nAt length itfroze  so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, andthe duckling had to paddle  with his legs as well as he could, tokeep the space from closing up.\"\\nHe became exhausted  at last, and laystill and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\"\\n Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw whathad happened.\"\\nHe broke  the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, andcarried the duckling home to his wife.\"\\n The warmth revived the poorlittle creature; but when the children wanted to play with  him, theduckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up interror,  fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about theroom.\"\\nThen the woman  clapped her hands, which frightened him stillmore.\"\\nHe flew first into the butter-cask,  then into the meal-tub,and out again.\"\\nWhat a condition he was in!\"\\nThe woman screamed,  andstruck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, andtumbled over  each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily heescaped.\"\\nThe door stood open;  the poor creature could just manage toslip out among the bushes, and lie down quite  exhausted in the newlyfallen snow.\"\\n It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery andprivations which the poor  little duckling endured during the hardwinter; but when it had passed, he found  himself lying one morningin a moor, amongst the rushes.\"\\nHe felt the warm sun shining,  and heardthe lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring.\"\\nThenthe young  bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped themagainst his sides, and rose  high into the air.\"\\nThey bore himonwards, until he found himself in a large garden,  before he well knewhow it had happened.\"\\nThe apple-trees were in full blossom, and  thefragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the streamwhich wound round  a smooth lawn.\"\\nEverything looked beautiful, in thefreshness of early spring.\"\\nFrom  a thicket close by came threebeautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and  swimming lightlyover the smooth water.\"\\nThe duckling remembered the lovely birds,  andfelt more strangely unhappy than ever.\"\\n \"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they willkill me, because I  am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but itdoes not matter: better be killed by  them than pecked by the ducks,beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds  thepoultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\\n  Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans.The moment they espied  the stranger, they rushed to meet him withoutstretched wings.\"\\n \"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to thesurface of the water,  and awaited death.\"\\n But what did he see in the clear stream below?\"\\nHis own image; nolonger a dark, gray  bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but agraceful and beautiful swan.\"\\nTo be born  in a duck\\'s nest, in afarmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from  aswan\\'s egg.\"\\nHe now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble,because it enabled  him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure andhappiness around him; for the great  swans swam round the new-comer,and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\"\\n Into the garden presently came some little children, and threwbread and cake into  the water.\"\\n \"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest weredelighted, and ran  to their father and mother, dancing and clappingtheir hands, and shouting joyously,  \"There is another swan come; a newone has arrived.\"\\n  Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"Thenew one is the most  beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\"\\nAnd the old swans bowed their heads before  him.\"\\n Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; forhe did not know what  to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.He had been persecuted and despised  for his ugliness, and now he heardthem say he was the most beautiful of all the birds.\"\\n Even theelder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sunshone  warm and bright.\"\\nThen he rustled his feathers, curved hisslender neck, and cried  joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"Inever dreamed of such happiness as this,  while I was an uglyduckling.\"\\n  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE WICKED PRINCE  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart andmind were set upon  conquering all the countries of the world, and onfrightening the people; he devastated  their countries with fire andsword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields  anddestroyed the peasants\\' huts by fire, so that the flames licked thegreen leaves  off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on thesinged black trees.\"\\nMany a poor  mother fled, her naked baby in herarms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage;  but also therethe soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served asnew  nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could notpossibly have done worse  things than these soldiers!\"\\nThe prince was ofopinion that all this was right, and  that it was only the naturalcourse which things ought to take.\"\\nHis power increased  day by day, hisname was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds.\"\\n He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, andgradually accumulated  in his residence riches which could nowhere beequalled.\"\\nHe erected magnificent  palaces, churches, and halls, and allwho saw these splendid buildings and great  treasures exclaimedadmiringly: \"What a mighty prince!\"\\n But they did not know what  endlessmisery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear thesighs and  lamentations which rose up from the debris of thedestroyed cities.\"\\n The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and hismagnificent edifices, and  thought, like the crowd: \"What a mightyprince!\"\\nBut I must have more- much more.\"\\nNo  power on earth mustequal mine, far less exceed it.\"\\n  He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them.\"\\nTheconquered kings were  chained up with golden fetters to his chariotwhen he drove through the streets of  his city.\"\\nThese kings had tokneel at his and his courtiers\\' feet when they sat at  table, andlive on the morsels which they left.\"\\nAt last the prince had his ownstatue  erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces;nay, he even wished it  to be placed in the churches, on the altars,but in this the priests opposed him, saying:  \"Prince, you are mightyindeed, but God\\'s power is much greater than yours; we dare  not obeyyour orders.\"\\n  \"Well,\" said the prince.\"\\n\"Then I will conquer God too.\"\\n And in hishaughtiness and  foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship tobe constructed, with which he  could sail through the air; it wasgorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like  the tail of a peacock,it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the  barrelof a gun.\"\\nThe prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only totouch a spring  in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in alldirections, while the guns were  at once loaded again.\"\\nHundreds ofeagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with  the swiftness ofan arrow up towards the sun.\"\\nThe earth was soon left far below,  andlooked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where theplough had made  furrows which separated green meadows; soon itlooked only like a map with indistinct  lines upon it; and at last itentirely disappeared in mist and clouds.\"\\nHigher and higher  rose theeagles up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angelsagainst  the ship.\"\\nThe wicked prince showered thousands of bullets uponhim, but they rebounded  from his shining wings and fell down likeordinary hailstones.\"\\nOne drop of blood, one  single drop, came out ofthe white feathers of the angel\\'s wings and fell upon the  ship inwhich the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it likethousands of  hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earthagain; the strong wings of the  eagles gave way, the wind roaredround the prince\\'s head, and the clouds around- were  they formed bythe smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes,like  crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws outafter him, and rose up  like enormous rocks, from which rollingmasses dashed down, and became fire-spitting  dragons.\"\\n The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at lastwith a terrible shock  into the branches of a large tree in the wood.\"\\n \"I will conquer God!\"\\n said the prince.\"\\n\"I have sworn it: my willmust be done!\"\\n  And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships tosail through the  air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel tobreak the walls of heaven with.\"\\nHe  gathered warriors from allcountries, so many that when they were placed side by side  theycovered the space of several miles.\"\\nThey entered the ships and theprince was  approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats- oneswarm of little gnats.\"\\nThey  buzzed round the prince and stung his faceand hands; angrily he drew his sword and  brandished it, but he onlytouched the air and did not hit the gnats.\"\\nThen he ordered  hisservants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that thegnats might no  longer be able to reach him.\"\\nThe servants carried outhis orders, but one single gnat  had placed itself inside one of thecoverings, crept into the prince\\'s ear and stung  him.\"\\nThe placeburnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood.\"\\nMad with pain,he  tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away,and danced about  before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who nowmocked at him, the mad prince, who  wished to make war with God, andwas overcome by a single little gnat.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE WILD SWANS  by Hans Christian Andersen  FAR away in the land to which the swallows fly when it iswinter, dwelt a king who  had eleven sons, and one daughter, namedEliza.\"\\nThe eleven brothers were princes, and  each went to schoolwith a star on his breast, and a sword by his side.\"\\nThey wrote  withdiamond pencils on gold slates, and learnt their lessons so quicklyand read so  easily that every one might know they were princes.Their sister Eliza sat on a little  stool of plate-glass, and had abook full of pictures, which had cost as much as half  a kingdom.\"\\nOh,these children were indeed happy, but it was not to remain soalways.\"\\n Their father, who was king of the country, married a verywicked queen, who did not  love the poor children at all.\"\\nThey knewthis from the very first day after the wedding.\"\\n In the palace therewere great festivities, and the children played at  receivingcompany; but instead of having, as usual, all the cakes and applesthat were  left, she gave them some sand in a tea-cup, and told them topretend it was cake.\"\\nThe  week after, she sent little Eliza into thecountry to a peasant and his wife, and then  she told the king somany untrue things about the young princes, that he gave himself  nomore trouble respecting them.\"\\n \"Go out into the world and get your own living,\" said the queen.\"\\nFly like great birds,  who have no voice.\"\\n But she could not make themugly as she wished, for they were turned  into eleven beautiful wildswans.\"\\nThen, with a strange cry, they flew through the  windows ofthe palace, over the park, to the forest beyond.\"\\nIt was earlymorning when  they passed the peasant\\'s cottage, where their sisterEliza lay asleep in her room.\"\\n They hovered over the roof, twistedtheir long necks and flapped their wings, but no  one heard them or sawthem, so they were at last obliged to fly away, high up in the  clouds;and over the wide world they flew till they came to a thick, darkwood, which  stretched far away to the seashore.\"\\nPoor little Elizawas alone in her room playing  with a green leaf, for she had noother playthings, and she pierced a hole through  the leaf, andlooked through it at the sun, and it was as if she saw her brothers\\'clear  eyes, and when the warm sun shone on her cheeks, she thoughtof all the kisses they  had given her.\"\\nOne day passed just likeanother; sometimes the winds rustled through  the leaves of therose-bush, and would whisper to the roses, \"Who can be morebeautiful  than you!\"\\n But the roses would shake their heads, and say,\"Eliza is.\"\\n And when the  old woman sat at the cottage door onSunday, and read her hymn-book, the wind would  flutter the leaves, andsay to the book, \"Who can be more pious than you?\"\\n and then  thehymn-book would answer \"Eliza.\"\\n And the roses and the hymn-book toldthe real truth.\"\\n At fifteen she returned home, but when the queen sawhow beautiful she was, she became  full of spite and hatred towardsher.\"\\nWillingly would she have turned her into a swan,  like herbrothers, but she did not dare to do so yet, because the king wishedto see  his daughter.\"\\nEarly one morning the queen went into thebath-room; it was built of  marble, and had soft cushions, trimmed withthe most beautiful tapestry.\"\\nShe took three  toads with her, and kissedthem, and said to one, \"When Eliza comes to the bath, seat  yourselfupon her head, that she may become as stupid as you are.\"\\n Then shesaid to  another, \"Place yourself on her forehead, that she maybecome as ugly as you are, and  that her father may not know her.\"\\n\"Rest on her heart,\" she whispered to the third,  \"then she will haveevil inclinations, and suffer in consequence.\"\\n So she put the  toadsinto the clear water, and they turned green immediately.\"\\nShe nextcalled Eliza,  and helped her to undress and get into the bath.\"\\nAsEliza dipped her head under the  water, one of the toads sat on herhair, a second on her forehead, and a third on her  breast, but she didnot seem to notice them, and when she rose out of the water,  therewere three red poppies floating upon it.\"\\nHad not the creatures beenvenomous or  been kissed by the witch, they would have been changedinto red roses.\"\\nAt all events  they became flowers, because they hadrested on Eliza\\'s head, and on her heart.\"\\nShe  was too good and tooinnocent for witchcraft to have any power over her.\"\\nWhen the  wickedqueen saw this, she rubbed her face with walnut-juice, so that she wasquite  brown; then she tangled her beautiful hair and smeared it withdisgusting ointment,  till it was quite impossible to recognize thebeautiful Eliza.\"\\n When her father saw her, he was much shocked, and declared she wasnot his daughter.\"\\n No one but the watch-dog and the swallows knewher; and they were only poor animals,  and could say nothing.\"\\nThen poorEliza wept, and thought of her eleven brothers, who  were all away.Sorrowfully, she stole away from the palace, and walked, the wholeday,  over fields and moors, till she came to the great forest.\"\\nSheknew not in what direction  to go; but she was so unhappy, and longedso for her brothers, who had been, like herself,  driven out into theworld, that she was determined to seek them.\"\\nShe had been but ashort  time in the wood when night came on, and she quite lost thepath; so she laid herself  down on the soft moss, offered up herevening prayer, and leaned her head against the  stump of a tree.\"\\nAllnature was still, and the soft, mild air fanned her forehead.\"\\n Thelight of hundreds of glow-worms shone amidst the grass and the moss,like green  fire; and if she touched a twig with her hand, ever solightly, the brilliant insects  fell down around her, likeshooting-stars.\"\\n All night long she dreamt of her brothers.\"\\nShe and they werechildren again, playing  together.\"\\nShe saw them writing with theirdiamond pencils on golden slates, while she  looked at the beautifulpicture-book which had cost half a kingdom.\"\\nThey were not  writinglines and letters, as they used to do; but descriptions of the nobledeeds they  had performed, and of all they had discovered and seen.In the picture-book, too,  everything was living.\"\\nThe birds sang, andthe people came out of the book, and spoke  to Eliza and herbrothers; but, as the leaves turned over, they darted back again  totheir places, that all might be in order.\"\\n When she awoke, the sun was high in the heavens; yet she could notsee him, for the  lofty trees spread their branches thickly over herhead; but his beams were glancing  through the leaves here and there,like a golden mist.\"\\nThere was a sweet fragrance  from the fresh greenverdure, and the birds almost perched upon her shoulders.\"\\nShe  heardwater rippling from a number of springs, all flowing in a lake withgolden sands.\"\\n Bushes grew thickly round the lake, and at one spot anopening had been made by a deer,  through which Eliza went down tothe water.\"\\nThe lake was so clear that, had not the  wind rustled thebranches of the trees and the bushes, so that they moved, they  wouldhave appeared as if painted in the depths of the lake; for everyleaf was reflected  in the water, whether it stood in the shade orthe sunshine.\"\\nAs soon as Eliza saw her  own face, she was quiteterrified at finding it so brown and ugly; but when she wetted  herlittle hand, and rubbed her eyes and forehead, the white skingleamed forth once  more; and, after she had undressed, and dippedherself in the fresh water, a more  beautiful king\\'s daughter could notbe found in the wide world.\"\\nAs soon as she had  dressed herselfagain, and braided her long hair, she went to the bubbling spring,  anddrank some water out of the hollow of her hand.\"\\nThen she wanderedfar into the forest,  not knowing whither she went.\"\\nShe thought ofher brothers, and felt sure that God would  not forsake her.\"\\nIt isGod who makes the wild apples grow in the wood, to satisfy the  hungry,and He now led her to one of these trees, which was so loaded withfruit, that  the boughs bent beneath the weight.\"\\nHere she held hernoonday repast, placed props  under the boughs, and then went intothe gloomiest depths of the forest.\"\\nIt was so  still that she couldhear the sound of her own footsteps, as well as the rustling  ofevery withered leaf which she crushed under her feet.\"\\nNot a bird wasto be seen,  not a sunbeam could penetrate through the large, darkboughs of the trees.\"\\nTheir lofty  trunks stood so close together, that,when she looked before her, it seemed as if she  were enclosed withintrellis-work.\"\\nSuch solitude she had never known before.\"\\nThe  nightwas very dark.\"\\nNot a single glow-worm glittered in the moss.\"\\n Sorrowfully she laid herself down to sleep; and, after a while, itseemed to her as  if the branches of the trees parted over her head,and that the mild eyes of angels  looked down upon her from heaven.When she awoke in the morning, she knew not whether  she had dreamtthis, or if it had really been so.\"\\nThen she continued her wandering;but  she had not gone many steps forward, when she met an old womanwith berries in her  basket, and she gave her a few to eat.\"\\nThenEliza asked her if she had not seen eleven  princes riding throughthe forest.\"\\n \"No,\" replied the old woman, \"But I saw yesterday eleven swans,with gold crowns on  their heads, swimming on the river close by.\"\\n Thenshe led Eliza a little distance  farther to a sloping bank, and atthe foot of it wound a little river.\"\\nThe trees on  its banksstretched their long leafy branches across the water towards eachother, and  where the growth prevented them from meeting naturally, theroots had torn themselves  away from the ground, so that the branchesmight mingle their foliage as they hung  over the water.\"\\nEliza bade theold woman farewell, and walked by the flowing river,  till shereached the shore of the open sea.\"\\nAnd there, before the youngmaiden\\'s eyes,  lay the glorious ocean, but not a sail appeared onits surface, not even a boat could  be seen.\"\\nHow was she to go farther?She noticed how the countless pebbles on the  sea-shore had beensmoothed and rounded by the action of the water.\"\\nGlass, iron,stones,  everything that lay there mingled together, had taken itsshape from the same power,  and felt as smooth, or even smoother thanher own delicate hand.\"\\n\"The water rolls on  without weariness,\" shesaid, till all that is hard becomes smooth; so will I be  unweariedin my task.\"\\nThanks for your lessons, bright rolling waves; my hearttells  me you will lead me to my dear brothers.\"\\n On the foam-coveredsea-weeds, lay eleven  white swan feathers, which she gathered up andplaced together.\"\\nDrops of water lay  upon them; whether they weredew-drops or tears no one could say.\"\\nLonely as it was  on thesea-shore, she did not observe it, for the ever-moving sea showed morechanges  in a few hours than the most varying lake could produce duringa whole year.\"\\nIf a black  heavy cloud arose, it was as if the sea said,\"I can look dark and angry too;\" and  then the wind blew, and the wavesturned to white foam as they rolled.\"\\nWhen the wind  slept, and theclouds glowed with the red sunlight, then the sea looked like a roseleaf.\"\\n But however quietly its white glassy surface rested, there wasstill a motion on the  shore, as its waves rose and fell like thebreast of a sleeping child.\"\\nWhen the sun  was about to set, Eliza saweleven white swans with golden crowns on their heads, flying  towardsthe land, one behind the other, like a long white ribbon.\"\\nThen Elizawent down  the slope from the shore, and hid herself behind the bushes.The swans alighted quite  close to her and flapped their great whitewings.\"\\nAs soon as the sun had disappeared  under the water, thefeathers of the swans fell off, and eleven beautiful  princes,Eliza\\'s brothers, stood near her.\"\\nShe uttered a loud cry, for,although they  were very much changed, she knew them immediately.\"\\nShesprang into their arms, and  called them each by name.\"\\nThen, howhappy the princes were at meeting their little  sister again, forthey recognized her, although she had grown so tall and  beautiful.They laughed, and they wept, and very soon understood how wickedlytheir  mother had acted to them all.\"\\n\"We brothers,\" said the eldest,\"fly about as wild swans,  so long as the sun is in the sky; but assoon as it sinks behind the hills, we recover  our human shape.Therefore must we always be near a resting place for our feet  beforesunset; for if we should be flying towards the clouds at the time werecovered  our natural shape as men, we should sink deep into thesea.\"\\nWe do not dwell here, but  in a land just as fair, that liesbeyond the ocean, which we have to cross for a long  distance; there isno island in our passage upon which we could pass, the night;nothing  but a little rock rising out of the sea, upon which we canscarcely stand with safety,  even closely crowded together.\"\\nIf thesea is rough, the foam dashes over us, yet we  thank God even forthis rock; we have passed whole nights upon it, or we should  neverhave reached our beloved fatherland, for our flight across the seaoccupies two  of the longest days in the year.\"\\nWe have permission tovisit out home once in every  year, and to remain eleven days, duringwhich we fly across the forest to look once  more at the palace whereour father dwells, and where we were born, and at the church,  whereour mother lies buried.\"\\nHere it seems as if the very trees andbushes were related  to us.\"\\nThe wild horses leap over the plains aswe have seen them in our childhood.\"\\n The charcoal burners sing theold songs, to which we have danced as children.\"\\nThis  is ourfatherland, to which we are drawn by loving ties; and here we havefound you,  our dear little sister., Two days longer we can remainhere, and then must we fly away  to a beautiful land which is not ourhome; and how can we take you with us?\"\\nWe have  neither ship nor boat.\"\\n  \"How can I break this spell?\"\\n said their sister.\"\\nAnd then shetalked about it nearly  the whole night, only slumbering for a fewhours.\"\\nEliza was awakened by the rustling  of the swans\\' wings asthey soared above.\"\\nHer brothers were again changed to swans,  andthey flew in circles wider and wider, till they were far away; but oneof them,  the youngest swan, remained behind, and laid his head inhis sister\\'s lap, while she  stroked his wings; and they remainedtogether the whole day.\"\\nTowards evening, the rest  came back, and asthe sun went down they resumed their natural forms.\"\\n\"To-morrow,\"said  one, \"we shall fly away, not to return again till a whole yearhas passed.\"\\nBut we cannot  leave you here.\"\\nHave you courage to gowith us?\"\\nMy arm is strong enough to carry you  through the wood; andwill not all our wings be strong enough to fly with you over  the sea?\"\\n  \"Yes, take me with you,\" said Eliza.\"\\nThen they spent the wholenight in weaving a net  with the pliant willow and rushes.\"\\nIt wasvery large and strong.\"\\nEliza laid herself  down on the net, and whenthe sun rose, and her brothers again became wild swans, they  took upthe net with their beaks, and flew up to the clouds with their dearsister,  who still slept.\"\\nThe sunbeams fell on her face, thereforeone of the swans soared over  her head, so that his broad wings mightshade her.\"\\nThey were far from the land when  Eliza woke.\"\\nShe thoughtshe must still be dreaming, it seemed so strange to her to  feelherself being carried so high in the air over the sea.\"\\nBy her side laya branch  full of beautiful ripe berries, and a bundle of sweetroots; the youngest of her  brothers had gathered them for her, andplaced them by her side.\"\\nShe smiled her thanks  to him; she knew it wasthe same who had hovered over her to shade her with his wings.\"\\n Theywere now so high, that a large ship beneath them looked like a whitesea-gull  skimming the waves.\"\\nA great cloud floating behind themappeared like a vast mountain,  and upon it Eliza saw her own shadowand those of the eleven swans, looking gigantic  in size.\"\\nAltogether itformed a more beautiful picture than she had ever seen; but  as the sunrose higher, and the clouds were left behind, the shadowy picturevanished  away.\"\\nOnward the whole day they flew through the air like awinged arrow, yet more  slowly than usual, for they had their sister tocarry.\"\\nThe weather seemed inclined  to be stormy, and Eliza watched thesinking sun with great anxiety, for the little  rock in the ocean wasnot yet in sight.\"\\nIt appeared to her as if the swans were making  greatefforts with their wings.\"\\nAlas!\"\\nshe was the cause of their notadvancing more  quickly.\"\\nWhen the sun set, they would change to men,fall into the sea and be drowned.\"\\n Then she offered a prayer from herinmost heart, but still no appearance of the rock.\"\\n Dark clouds camenearer, the gusts of wind told of a coming storm, while from athick,  heavy mass of clouds the lightning burst forth flash afterflash.\"\\nThe sun had reached  the edge of the sea, when the swansdarted down so swiftly, that Eliza\\'s head trembled;  she believedthey were falling, but they again soared onward.\"\\nPresently shecaught  sight of the rock just below them, and by this time the sun washalf hidden by the  waves.\"\\nThe rock did not appear larger than a seal\\'shead thrust out of the water.\"\\nThey  sunk so rapidly, that at the momenttheir feet touched the rock, it shone only like  a star, and at lastdisappeared like the last spark in a piece of burnt paper.\"\\nThen  shesaw her brothers standing closely round her with their arms linkedtogether.\"\\nThere  was but just room enough for them, and not thesmallest space to spare.\"\\nThe sea dashed  against the rock, andcovered them with spray.\"\\nThe heavens were lighted up with  continualflashes, and peal after peal of thunder rolled.\"\\nBut the sister andbrothers  sat holding each other\\'s hands, and singing hymns, from whichthey gained hope and  courage.\"\\nIn the early dawn the air became calmand still, and at sunrise the swans  flew away from the rock withEliza.\"\\nThe sea was still rough, and from their high  position in theair, the white foam on the dark green waves looked like millions ofswans  swimming on the water.\"\\nAs the sun rose higher, Eliza sawbefore her, floating on the  air, a range of mountains, with shiningmasses of ice on their summits.\"\\nIn the centre,  rose a castleapparently a mile long, with rows of columns, rising one aboveanother,  while, around it, palm-trees waved and flowers bloomed aslarge as mill wheels.\"\\nShe  asked if this was the land to which theywere hastening.\"\\nThe swans shook their heads,  for what she beheldwere the beautiful ever-changing cloud palaces of the  \"FataMorgana,\" into which no mortal can enter.\"\\nEliza was still gazing atthe scene,  when mountains, forests, and castles melted away, andtwenty stately churches rose  in their stead, with high towers andpointed gothic windows.\"\\nEliza even fancied she  could hear the tones ofthe organ, but it was the music of the murmuring sea which  sheheard.\"\\nAs they drew nearer to the churches, they also changed into afleet of ships,  which seemed to be sailing beneath her; but as shelooked again, she found it was only  a sea mist gliding over the ocean.So there continued to pass before her eyes a constant  change of scene,till at last she saw the real land to which they were bound, withits  blue mountains, its cedar forests, and its cities and palaces.Long before the sun  went down, she sat on a rock, in front of alarge cave, on the floor of which the  over-grown yet delicate greencreeping plants looked like an embroidered carpet.\"\\n\"Now  we shallexpect to hear what you dream of to-night,\" said the youngest brother,as he  showed his sister her bedroom.\"\\n \"Heaven grant that I may dream how to save you,\" she replied.And this thought took  such hold upon her mind that she prayedearnestly to God for help, and even in her  sleep she continued topray.\"\\nThen it appeared to her as if she were flying high in  the air,towards the cloudy palace of the \"Fata Morgana,\" and a fairy cameout to meet  her, radiant and beautiful in appearance, and yet verymuch like the old woman who  had given her berries in the wood, and whohad told her of the swans with golden crowns  on their heads.\"\\n\"Yourbrothers can be released,\" said she, \"if you have only courage  andperseverance.\"\\nTrue, water is softer than your own delicate hands,and yet it  polishes stones into shapes; it feels no pain as yourfingers would feel, it has no  soul, and cannot suffer such agony andtorment as you will have to endure.\"\\nDo you see  the stinging nettlewhich I hold in my hand?\"\\nQuantities of the same sort grow round  thecave in which you sleep, but none will be of any use to you unlessthey grow upon  the graves in a churchyard.\"\\nThese you must gathereven while they burn blisters on  your hands.\"\\nBreak them to pieces withyour hands and feet, and they will become flax,  from which you mustspin and weave eleven coats with long sleeves; if these are  thenthrown over the eleven swans, the spell will be broken.\"\\nButremember, that from  the moment you commence your task until it isfinished, even should it occupy years  of your life, you must notspeak.\"\\nThe first word you utter will pierce through the  hearts of yourbrothers like a deadly dagger.\"\\nTheir lives hang upon your  tongue.Remember all I have told you.\"\\n And as she finished speaking, shetouched her  hand lightly with the nettle, and a pain, as of burningfire, awoke Eliza.\"\\n It was broad daylight, and close by where she had been sleepinglay a nettle like the  one she had seen in her dream.\"\\nShe fell on herknees and offered her thanks to God.\"\\n Then she went forth from the caveto begin her work with her delicate hands.\"\\nShe groped  in amongst theugly nettles, which burnt great blisters on her hands and arms, butshe  determined to bear it gladly if she could only release her dearbrothers.\"\\nSo she bruised  the nettles with her bare feet and spun theflax.\"\\nAt sunset her brothers returned and  were very much frightenedwhen they found her dumb.\"\\nThey believed it to be some new  sorcery oftheir wicked step-mother.\"\\nBut when they saw her hands theyunderstood what  she was doing on their behalf, and the youngestbrother wept, and where his tears fell  the pain ceased, and theburning blisters vanished.\"\\nShe kept to her work all night,  for shecould not rest till she had released her dear brothers.\"\\nDuring thewhole of  the following day, while her brothers were absent, she sat insolitude, but never  before had the time flown so quickly.\"\\nOne coat wasalready finished and she had begun  the second, when she heard thehuntsman\\'s horn, and was struck with fear.\"\\nThe sound  came nearer andnearer, she heard the dogs barking, and fled with terror into thecave.\"\\n She hastily bound together the nettles she had gathered into abundle and sat upon  them.\"\\nImmediately a great dog came boundingtowards her out of the ravine, and then  another and another; theybarked loudly, ran back, and then came again.\"\\nIn a very few  minutesall the huntsmen stood before the cave, and the handsomest of them wasthe king  of the country.\"\\nHe advanced towards her, for he had neverseen a more beautiful maiden.\"\\n \"How did you come here, my sweet child?\"\\n he asked.\"\\nBut Eliza shookher head.\"\\nShe dared  not speak, at the cost of her brothers\\' lives.\"\\nAndshe hid her hands under her apron,  so that the king might not seehow she must be suffering.\"\\n \"Come with me,\" he said; \"here you cannot remain.\"\\nIf you are asgood as you are beautiful,  I will dress you in silk and velvet, I willplace a golden crown upon your head, and  you shall dwell, and rule,and make your home in my richest castle.\"\\n And then he lifted  her onhis horse.\"\\nShe wept and wrung her hands, but the king said, \"I wishonly for  your happiness.\"\\nA time will come when you will thank me forthis.\"\\n And then he galloped  away over the mountains, holding herbefore him on this horse, and the hunters followed  behind them.\"\\nAs thesun went down, they approached a fair royal city, with churches,  andcupolas.\"\\nOn arriving at the castle the king led her into marble halls,where large  fountains played, and where the walls and the ceilingswere covered with rich paintings.\"\\n But she had no eyes for all theseglorious sights, she could only mourn and weep.\"\\n Patiently sheallowed the women to array her in royal robes, to weave pearls inher  hair, and draw soft gloves over her blistered fingers.\"\\nAs shestood before them in  all her rich dress, she looked so dazzinglybeautiful that the court bowed low in her  presence.\"\\nThen the kingdeclared his intention of making her his bride, but the  archbishopshook his head, and whispered that the fair young maiden was only awitch  who had blinded the king\\'s eyes and bewitched his heart.\"\\nBut theking would not listen  to this; he ordered the music to sound, thedaintiest dishes to be served, and the  loveliest maidens to dance.After-wards he led her through fragrant gardens and lofty  halls, butnot a smile appeared on her lips or sparkled in her eyes.\"\\nShe lookedthe  very picture of grief.\"\\nThen the king opened the door of a littlechamber in which she.\"\\n was to sleep; it was adorned with rich greentapestry, and resembled the cave in which  he had found her.\"\\nOn thefloor lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from the  nettles,and under the ceiling hung the coat she had made.\"\\nThese things hadbeen brought  away from the cave as curiosities by one of the huntsmen.\"\\n \"Here you can dream yourself back again in the old home in thecave,\" said the king;  \"here is the work with which you employedyourself.\"\\nIt will amuse you now in the midst  of all this splendor tothink of that time.\"\\n  When Eliza saw all these things which lay so near her heart, asmile played around  her mouth, and the crimson blood rushed to hercheeks.\"\\nShe thought of her brothers,  and their release made her sojoyful that she kissed the king\\'s hand.\"\\nThen he pressed  her to hisheart.\"\\nVery soon the joyous church bells announced the marriage feast,and  that the beautiful dumb girl out of the wood was to be made thequeen of the country.\"\\n Then the archbishop whispered wicked words inthe king\\'s ear, but they did not sink  into his heart.\"\\nThe marriage wasstill to take place, and the archbishop himself had  to place the crownon the bride\\'s head; in his wicked spite, he pressed the  narrowcirclet so tightly on her forehead that it caused her pain.\"\\nBut aheavier weight  encircled her heart- sorrow for her brothers.\"\\nShefelt not bodily pain.\"\\nHer mouth was  closed; a single word would costthe lives of her brothers.\"\\nBut she loved the kind,  handsome king,who did everything to make her happy more and more each day; she lovedhim  with all her heart, and her eyes beamed with the love she darednot speak.\"\\nOh!\"\\nif she  had only been able to confide in him and tellhim of her grief.\"\\nBut dumb she must remain  till her task was finished.Therefore at night she crept away into her little chamber,  which hadbeen decked out to look like the cave, and quickly wove one coat afteranother.\"\\n But when she began the seventh she found she had no moreflax.\"\\nShe knew that the nettles  she wanted to use grew in thechurchyard, and that she must pluck them herself.\"\\nHow  should she getout there?\"\\n\"Oh, what is the pain in my fingers to the torment which  myheart endures?\"\\n said she.\"\\n\"I must venture, I shall not be deniedhelp from heaven.\"\\n  Then with a trembling heart, as if she were aboutto perform a wicked deed, she crept  into the garden in the broadmoonlight, and passed through the narrow walks and the  desertedstreets, till she reached the churchyard.\"\\nThen she saw on one of thebroad  tombstones a group of ghouls.\"\\nThese hideous creatures took offtheir rags, as if they  intended to bathe, and then clawing open thefresh graves with their long, skinny  fingers, pulled out the deadbodies and ate the flesh!\"\\nEliza had to pass close by them,  and theyfixed their wicked glances upon her, but she prayed silently, gatheredthe  burning nettles, and carried them home with her to the castle.\"\\nOneperson only had  seen her, and that was the archbishop- he was awakewhile everybody was asleep.\"\\nNow  he thought his opinion was evidentlycorrect.\"\\nAll was not right with the queen.\"\\nShe  was a witch, and hadbewitched the king and all the people.\"\\nSecretly he told the  kingwhat he had seen and what he feared, and as the hard words came fromhis tongue,  the carved images of the saints shook their heads as ifthey would say.\"\\n\"It is not  so.\"\\nEliza is innocent.\"\\n  But the archbishop interpreted it in another way; he believed thatthey witnessed  against her, and were shaking their heads at herwickedness.\"\\nTwo large tears rolled  down the king\\'s cheeks, and he wenthome with doubt in his heart, and at night he  pretended to sleep,but there came no real sleep to his eyes, for he saw Eliza get  upevery night and disappear in her own chamber.\"\\nFrom day to day his browbecame darker,  and Eliza saw it and did not understand the reason, butit alarmed her and made her  heart tremble for her brothers.\"\\nHer hottears glittered like pearls on the regal velvet  and diamonds, whileall who saw her were wishing they could be queens.\"\\nIn the mean  timeshe had almost finished her task; only one coat of mail was wanting,but she had  no flax left, and not a single nettle.\"\\nOnce more only, andfor the last time, must  she venture to the churchyard and pluck afew handfuls.\"\\nShe thought with terror of  the solitary walk, and of thehorrible ghouls, but her will was firm, as well as her  trust inProvidence.\"\\nEliza went, and the king and the archbishop followedher.\"\\nThey  saw her vanish through the wicket gate into thechurchyard, and when they came nearer  they saw the ghouls sitting onthe tombstone, as Eliza had seen them, and the king  turned away hishead, for he thought she was with them- she whose head had rested onhis  breast that very evening.\"\\n\"The people must condemn her,\" saidhe, and she was very  quickly condemned by every one to suffer death byfire.\"\\nAway from the gorgeous regal  halls was she led to a dark, drearycell, where the wind whistled through the iron  bars.\"\\nInstead of thevelvet and silk dresses, they gave her the coats of mail which  she hadwoven to cover her, and the bundle of nettles for a pillow; butnothing they  could give her would have pleased her more.\"\\nShe continuedher task with joy, and prayed  for help, while the street-boys sangjeering songs about her, and not a soul comforted  her with a kindword.\"\\nTowards evening, she heard at the grating the flutter of aswan\\'s  wing, it was her youngest brother- he had found his sister, andshe sobbed for joy,  although she knew that very likely this would bethe last night she would have to live.\"\\n But still she could hope, forher task was almost finished, and her brothers were come.\"\\n Then thearchbishop arrived, to be with her during her last hours, as he hadpromised  the king.\"\\nBut she shook her head, and begged him, by looksand gestures, not to stay;  for in this night she knew she mustfinish her task, otherwise all her pain and tears  and sleepless nightswould have been suffered in vain.\"\\nThe archbishop withdrew,  utteringbitter words against her; but poor Eliza knew that she was innocent,and  diligently continued her work.\"\\n The little mice ran about the floor, they dragged the nettles toher feet, to help  as well as they could; and the thrush sat outsidethe grating of the window, and sang  to her the whole night long, assweetly as possible, to keep up her spirits.\"\\n It was still twilight, and at least an hour before sunrise, whenthe eleven brothers  stood at the castle gate, and demanded to bebrought before the king.\"\\nThey were told  it could not be, it was yetalmost night, and as the king slept they dared not disturb  him.\"\\nTheythreatened, they entreated.\"\\nThen the guard appeared, and even the  kinghimself, inquiring what all the noise meant.\"\\nAt this moment the sunrose.\"\\nThe  eleven brothers were seen no more, but eleven wild swansflew away over the castle.\"\\n And now all the people came streaming forth from the gates ofthe city, to see the  witch burnt.\"\\nAn old horse drew the cart onwhich she sat.\"\\nThey had dressed her in a  garment of coarsesackcloth.\"\\nHer lovely hair hung loose on her shoulders, her  cheekswere deadly pale, her lips moved silently, while her fingers stillworked at  the green flax.\"\\nEven on the way to death, she would not giveup her task.\"\\nThe ten coats  of mail lay at her feet, she was workinghard at the eleventh, while the mob jeered  her and said, \"See thewitch, how she mutters!\"\\nShe has no hymn-book in her hand.\"\\nShe  sitsthere with her ugly sorcery.\"\\nLet us tear it in a thousand pieces.\"\\n  And then they pressed towards her, and would have destroyed thecoats of mail, but  at the same moment eleven wild swans flew over her,and alighted on the cart.\"\\nThen  they flapped their large wings, and thecrowd drew on one side in alarm.\"\\n \"It is a sign from heaven that she is innocent,\" whispered many ofthem; but they  ventured not to say it aloud.\"\\n As the executioner seized her by the hand, to lift her out ofthe cart, she hastily  threw the eleven coats of mail over the swans,and they immediately became eleven  handsome princes; but theyoungest had a swan\\'s wing, instead of an arm; for she had  not beenable to finish the last sleeve of the coat.\"\\n \"Now I may speak,\" she exclaimed.\"\\n\"I am innocent.\"\\n  Then the people, who saw what happened, bowed to her, as beforea saint; but she sank  lifeless in her brothers\\' arms, overcome withsuspense, anguish, and pain.\"\\n \"Yes, she is innocent,\" said the eldest brother; and then herelated all that had taken  place; and while he spoke there rose in theair a fragrance as from millions of roses.\"\\n Every piece of faggot inthe pile had taken root, and threw out branches, and appeared  athick hedge, large and high, covered with roses; while above allbloomed a white and  shining flower, that glittered like a star.\"\\nThisflower the king plucked, and placed  in Eliza\\'s bosom, when she awokefrom her swoon, with peace and happiness in her heart.\"\\n And all thechurch bells rang of themselves, and the birds came in great troops.And  a marriage procession returned to the castle, such as no kinghad ever before seen.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  THE WILL-O-THE WISP IS IN THE TOWN,  SAYS THE MOOR WOMAN  by Hans Christian Andersen  THERE was a man who once knew many stories, but they had slippedaway from him- so  he said.\"\\nThe Story that used to visit him of its ownaccord no longer came and knocked  at his door.\"\\nAnd why did it comeno longer?\"\\nIt is true enough that for days and years  the man had notthought of it, had not expected it to come and knock; and if he  hadexpected it, it would certainly not have come; for without there waswar, and within  was the care and sorrow that war brings with it.\"\\n The stork and the swallows came back from their long journey,for they thought of no  danger; and, behold, when they arrived, thenest was burnt, the habitations of men  were burnt, the hedges were allin disorder, and everything seemed gone, and the  enemy\\'s horses werestamping in the old graves.\"\\nThose were hard, gloomy times, but  theycame to an end.\"\\n And now they were past and gone- so people said; yet no Story cameand knocked at the  door, or gave any tidings of its presence.\"\\n \"I suppose it must be dead, or gone away with many otherthings,\" said the man.\"\\n But the story never dies.\"\\nAnd more than a whole year went by,and he longed- oh, so  very much!- for the Story.\"\\n \"I wonder if the Story will ever come back again and knock?\"\\n  And he remembered it so well in all the various forms in whichit had come to him,  sometimes young and charming, like springitself, sometimes as a beautiful maiden,  with a wreath of thyme in herhair, and a beechen branch in her hand, and with eyes  that gleamedlike deep woodland lakes in the bright sunshine.\"\\n Sometimes it had come to him in the guise of a peddler, and hadopened its box and  let silver ribbon come fluttering out, withverses and inscriptions of old  remembrances.\"\\n But it was most charming of all when it came as an oldgrandmother, with silvery hair,  and such large, sensible eyes.\"\\nSheknew so well how to tell about the oldest times,  long before theprincesses spun with the golden spindles, and the dragons layoutside  the castles, guarding them.\"\\nShe told with such an air oftruth, that black spots danced  before the eyes of all who heard her,and the floor became black with human blood;  terrible to see and tohear, and yet so entertaining, because such a long time had  passedsince it all happened.\"\\n \"Will it ever knock at my door again?\"\\n said the man, and hegazed at the door, so that  black spots came before his eyes and uponthe floor; he did not know if it was blood,  or mourning crape from thedark heavy days.\"\\n And as he sat thus, the thought came upon him whether the Storymight not have hidden  itself, like the princess in the old tale.\"\\nAndhe would now go in search of it; if  he found it, it would beam innew splendor, lovelier than ever.\"\\n \"Who knows?\"\\nPerhaps it has hidden itself in the straw thatbalances on the margin of  the well.\"\\nCarefully, carefully!\"\\nPerhaps itlies hidden in a certain flower- that flower  in one of the great bookson the book-shelf.\"\\n  And the man went and opened one of the newest books, to gaininformation on this point;  but there was no flower to be found.There he read about Holger Danske; and the man  read that the talehad been invented and put together by a monk in France, that it  wasa romance, \"translated into Danish and printed in that language;\" thatHolger  Danske had never really lived, and consequently could nevercome again, as we have  sung, and have been so glad to believe.\"\\nAndWilliam Tell was treated just like Holger  Danske.\"\\nThese were allonly myths- nothing on which we could depend; and yet it is  allwritten in a very learned book.\"\\n \"Well, I shall believe what I believe!\"\\n said the man.\"\\n\"There growsno plantain where  no foot has trod.\"\\n  And he closed the book and put it back in its place, and went tothe fresh flowers  at the window.\"\\nPerhaps the Story might have hiddenitself in the red tulips, with the  golden yellow edges, or in thefresh rose, or in the beaming camellia.\"\\nThe sunshine  lay among theflowers, but no Story.\"\\n The flowers which had been here in the dark troublous time hadbeen much more beautiful;  but they had been cut off, one afteranother, to be woven into wreaths and placed in  coffins, and theflag had waved over them!\"\\nPerhaps the Story had been buried with  theflowers; but then the flowers would have known of it, and the coffinwould have  heard it, and every little blade of grass that shot forthwould have told of it.\"\\nThe  Story never dies.\"\\n Perhaps it has been here once, and has knocked; but who had eyesor ears for it in  those times?\"\\nPeople looked darkly, gloomily, andalmost angrily at the sunshine of  spring, at the twittering birds, andall the cheerful green; the tongue could not even  bear the oldmerry, popular songs, and they were laid in the coffin with so muchthat  our heart held dear.\"\\nThe Story may have knocked without obtaininga hearing; there  was none to bid it welcome, and so it may have goneaway.\"\\n \"I will go forth and seek it.\"\\nOut in the country!\"\\nout in the wood!and on the open  sea beach!\"\\n  Out in the country lies an old manor house, with red walls,pointed gables, and a red  flag that floats on the tower.\"\\nThenightingale sings among the finely-fringed  beech-leaves, looking atthe blooming apple trees of the garden, and thinking that  they bearroses.\"\\nHere the bees are mightily busy in the summer-time, and hoverround  their queen with their humming song.\"\\nThe autumn has much to tellof the wild chase,  of the leaves of the trees, and of the races of menthat are passing away together.\"\\n The wild swans sing atChristmas-time on the open water, while in the old hall the  guestsby the fireside gladly listen to songs and to old legends.\"\\n Down into the old part of the garden, where the great avenue ofwild chestnut trees  lures the wanderer to tread its shades, went theman who was in search of the Story;  for here the wind had oncemurmured something to him of \"Waldemar Daa and his  Daughters.\"\\n TheDryad in the tree, who was the Story-mother herself, had here told  himthe \"Dream of the Old Oak Tree.\"\\n Here, in the time of the ancestralmother, had  stood clipped hedges, but now only ferns and stingingnettles grew there, hiding the  scattered fragments of old sculpturedfigures; the moss is growing in their eyes, but  they can see as wellas ever, which was more than the man could do who was in search  of theStory, for he could not find that.\"\\nWhere could it be?\"\\n The crows flew past him by hundreds across the old trees, andscreamed, \"Krah!\"\\nda!-  Krah!\"\\nda!\"\\n  And he went out of the garden and over the grass-plot of the yard,into the alder grove;  there stood a little six-sided house, with apoultry-yard and a duck-yard.\"\\nIn the  middle of the room sat the oldwoman who had the management of the whole, and who knew  accuratelyabout every egg that was laid, and about every chicken that couldcreep out  of an egg.\"\\nBut she was not the Story of which the man was insearch; that she could  attest with a Christian certificate ofbaptism and of vaccination that lay in her  drawer.\"\\n Without, not far from the house, is a hill covered withred-thorn and broom.\"\\nHere lies  an old grave-stone, which was broughthere many years ago from the churchyard of the  provincial town, aremembrance of one of the most honored councillors of the place;  hiswife and his five daughters, all with folded hands and stiff ruffs,stand round  him.\"\\nOne could look at them so long, that it had an effectupon the thoughts, and these  reacted upon the stones, as if theywere telling of old times; at least it had been  so with the man whowas in search of the Story.\"\\n As he came nearer, he noticed a living butterfly sitting on theforehead of the  sculptured councillor.\"\\nThe butterfly flapped itswings, and flew a little bit farther,  and then returned fatigued tosit upon the grave-stone, as if to point out what grew  there.Four-leaved shamrocks grew there; there were seven specimens closeto each other.\"\\n When fortune comes, it comes in a heap.\"\\nHe pluckedthe shamrocks and put them in his  pocket.\"\\n \"Fortune is as good as red gold, but a new charming story would bebetter still,\"  thought the man; but he could not find it here.\"\\n And the sun went down, round and large; the meadow was coveredwith vapor.\"\\nThe  moor-woman was at her brewing.\"\\n It was evening.\"\\nHe stood alone in his room, and looked out uponthe sea, over the meadow,  over moor and coast.\"\\nThe moon shonebright, a mist was over the meadow, making it look  like a greatlake; and, indeed, it was once so, as the legend tells- and in themoonlight  the eye realizes these myths.\"\\n Then the man thought of what he had been reading in the town, thatWilliam Tell and  Holger Danske never really lived, but yet live inpopular story, like the lake yonder,  a living evidence for such myths.Yes, Holger Danske will return again!\"\\n As he stood thus and thought, something beat quite stronglyagainst the window.\"\\nWas  it a bird, a bat or an owl?\"\\nThose are notlet in, even when they knock.\"\\nThe window  flew open of itself, and anold woman looked in at the man.\"\\n \"What\\'s your pleasure?\"\\n said he.\"\\n\"Who are you?\"\\nYou\\'re looking inat the first floor  window.\"\\nAre you standing on a ladder?\"\\n  \"You have a four-leaved shamrock in your pocket,\" she replied.\"\\nIndeed, you have seven,  and one of them is a six-leaved one.\"\\n  \"Who are you?\"\\n asked the man again.\"\\n \"The Moor-woman,\" she replied.\"\\n\"The Moor-woman who brews.\"\\nI was atit.\"\\nThe bung was  in the cask, but one of the little moor-imps pulledit out in his mischief, and flung  it up into the yard, where it beatagainst the window; and now the beer\\'s running out  of the cask, andthat won\\'t do good to anybody.\"\\n  \"Pray tell me some more!\"\\n said the man.\"\\n \"Yes, wait a little,\" answered the Moor-woman.\"\\n\"I\\'ve somethingelse to do just now.\"\\n  And she was gone.\"\\n The man was going to shut the window, when the woman already stoodbefore him again.\"\\n \"Now it\\'s done,\" she said; \"but I shall have half the beer to brewover again to-morrow,  if the weather is suitable.\"\\nWell, what haveyou to ask me?\"\\nI\\'ve come back, for I always  keep my word, and you haveseven four-leaved shamrocks in your pocket, and one of them  is asix-leaved one.\"\\nThat inspires respect, for that\\'s an order thatgrows beside the  sandy way;

sometimes she would slipinto the church,  and wrap herself in the mourning crape that hung downfrom the candles on the altar.\"\\n  \"You are capitally well-informed,\" said the man.\"\\n \"I ought at least to know as much as you,\" answered theMoor-woman.\"\\n\"Stories and poetry\\ufffeyes, they\\'re like two yards of thesame piece of stuff;

the spirit  of them had beenextracted, refined, criticised and renovated, and then stored up  inbottles.\"\\nWith what may be called great aptitude, if it was notgenius the grandmother  had taken as it were the flavor of this andof that poet, and had added a little devilry,  and then corked up thebottles for use during all future times.\"\\n \"Pray let me see,\" said the man.\"\\n \"Yes, but there are more important things to hear,\" replied theMoor-woman.\"\\n \"But now we are at the cupboard!\"\\n said the man.\"\\nAnd he lookedin.\"\\n\"Here are bottles  of all sizes.\"\\nWhat is in this one?\"\\nand what inthat one yonder?\"\\n  \"Here is what they call may-balm,\" replied the woman.\"\\n\"I havenot tried it myself.\"\\n But I have not yet told you the \\'moreimportant\\' thing you were to hear.\"\\nTHE  WILL-O\\'-THE-WISP\\'S IN THE TOWN!That\\'s of much more consequence than poetry and  stories.\"\\nI ought,indeed, to hold my tongue;

and they havepermission, if they choose to use it, to go abroad among men,  and tomove about and command among them, just as if they were bornmortals.\"\\nThat was  a great event in the marsh, and accordingly allthe Will-o\\'-the-Wisps, male and female,  went dancing like littlelights across the moor.\"\\nThere are some of them of the dog  species, butthose are not worth mentioning.\"\\nI sat there on the cupboard, and hadall  the twelve little new-born Will-o\\'-the-Wisps upon my lap.\"\\nTheyshone like glow-worms;  they already began to hop, and increased insize every moment, so that before a quarter  of an hour had elapsed,each of them looked just as large as his father or his uncle.\"\\n Now,it\\'s an old-established regulation and favor, that when the moonstands just as  it did yesterday, and the wind blows just as it blewthen, it is allowed and accorded  to all Will-o\\'-the-Wisps- that is, toall those who are born at that minute of time\\ufffeto become mortals,and individually to exert their power for the space of one year.\"\\n \"The Will-o\\'-the-Wisp may run about in the country and through theworld, if it is  not afraid of falling into the sea, or of beingblown out by a heavy storm.\"\\nIt can  enter into a person and speak forhim, and make all the movements it pleases.\"\\nThe  Will-o\\'-the-Wisp maytake whatever form he likes, of man or woman, and can act in  theirspirit and in their disguise in such a way that he can effect whateverhe wishes  to do.\"\\nBut he must manage, in the course of the year, tolead three hundred and  sixty-five people into a bad way, and in agrand style, too.\"\\nTo lead them away from  the right and the truth;and then he reaches the highest point.\"\\nSuch a Will-o\\'-the-Wisp  canattain to the honor of being a runner before the devil\\'s statecoach; and then he\\'ll  wear clothes of fiery yellow, and breatheforth flames out of his throat.\"\\nThat\\'s enough  to make a simpleWill-o\\'-the-Wisp smack his lips.\"\\nBut there\\'s some danger in this,and  a great deal of work for a Will-o\\'-the-Wisp who aspires to play sodistinguished a  part.\"\\nIf the eyes of the man are opened to what he is,and if the man can then blow  him away, it\\'s all over with him, andhe must come back into the marsh; or if, before  the year is up, theWill-o\\'-the-Wisp is seized with a longing to see his family, and  soreturns to it and gives the matter up, it is over with him likewise,and he can no  longer burn clear, and soon becomes extinguished, andcannot be lit up again; and when  the year has elapsed, and he hasnot led three hundred and sixty-five people away from  the truth andfrom all that is grand and noble, he is condemned to be imprisonedin  decayed wood, and to lie glimmering there, without being able tomove; and that\\'s the  most terrible punishment that can be inflicted ona lively Will-o\\'-the-Wisp.\"\\n \"Now, all this I know, and all this I told to the twelve littleWill-o\\'-the-Wisps whom  I had on my lap, and who seemed quite crazywith joy.\"\\n \"I told them that the safest and most convenient course was togive up the honor, and  do nothing at all; but the little flameswould not agree to this, and already fancied  themselves clad infiery yellow clothes, breathing flames from their throats.\"\\n \"\\'Stay with us,\\' said some of the older ones.\"\\n \"\\'Carry on your sport with mortals,\\' said the others.\"\\n \"\\'The mortals are drying up our meadows;

and toall this company the news had  come that the Maidens were no longerto be called \"maidens,\" but \"hand-rammers,\" which  word was thenewest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thingwe  all know from the old times by the name of \"the maiden.\"\\n  Now, there are among us human creatures certain individuals whoare known as  \"emancipated women,\" as, for instance, principals ofinstitutions, dancers who stand  professionally on one leg,milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of  emancipated womenthe two Maidens in the shed associated themselves.\"\\nThey were  \"maidens\"among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this  honorableappellation, and let themselves be miscalled \"rammers.\"\\n \"Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and wewon\\'t be called things\\ufffethat\\'s insulting us.\"\\n  \"My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,\" said theyoungest, who was  betrothed to a paver\\'s hammer; and the hammer is thething which drives great piles  into the earth, like a machine, andtherefore does on a large scale what ten maidens  effect in a similarway.\"\\n\"He wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would have  mewere I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won\\'t have my name changed.\"\\n  \"And I,\" said the elder one, \"would rather have both my armsbroken off.\"\\n  But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and theWheelbarrow was looked upon  as of some consequence, for heconsidered himself a quarter of a coach, because he  went about uponone wheel.\"\\n \"I must submit to your notice,\" he said, \"that the name \\'maiden\\'is common enough,  and not nearly so refined as \\'hand-rammer,\\' or\\'stamper,\\' which latter has also been  proposed, and through whichyou would be introduced into the category of seals; and  only thinkof the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that giveseffect  to the laws!\"\\nNo, in your case I would surrender my maidenname.\"\\n  \"No, certainly not!\"\\n exclaimed the elder.\"\\n\"I am too old for that.\"\\n  \"I presume you have never heard of what is called \\'Europeannecessity?\\'\" observed the  honest Measuring Tape.\"\\n\"One must be ableto adapt one\\'s self to time and circumstances,  and if there is a lawthat the \\'maiden\\' is to be called \\'hand-rammer,\\' why, she must  becalled \\'hand-rammer,\\' and no pouting will avail, for everything hasits measure.\"\\n  \"No; if there must be a change,\" said the younger, \"I shouldprefer to be called  \\'Missy,\\' for that reminds one a little ofmaidens.\"\\n  \"But I would rather be chopped to chips,\" said the elder.\"\\n At last they all went to work.\"\\nThe Maidens rode- that is, theywere put in a wheelbarrow,  and that was a distinction; but stillthey were called \"hand-rammers.\"\\n  \"Mai-!\"\\n they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement.\"\\nMai-!\"\\n and they were very  nearly pronouncing the whole word \"maiden;\"but they broke off short, and swallowed  the last syllable; for aftermature deliberation they considered it beneath their  dignity toprotest.\"\\nBut they always called each other \"maiden,\" and praised thegood  old days in which everything had been called by its right name,and those who were  maidens were called maidens.\"\\nAnd they remained asthey were; for the hammer really  broke off his engagement with theyounger one, for nothing would suit him but he must  have a maidenfor his bride.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  UNDER THE WILLOW-TREE  by Hans Christian Andersen  THE region round the little town of Kjoge is very bleak andcold.\"\\nThe town lies on  the sea shore, which is always beautiful; buthere it might be more beautiful than  it is, for on every side thefields are flat, and it is a long way to the forest.\"\\nBut  whenpersons reside in a place and get used to it, they can always findsomething  beautiful in it,- something for which they long, even in themost charming spot in  the world which is not home.\"\\nIt must be ownedthat there are in the outskirts of the  town some humble gardens on thebanks of a little stream that runs on towards the sea,  and in summerthese gardens look very pretty.\"\\nSuch indeed was the opinion of twolittle  children, whose parents were neighbors, and who played in thesegardens, and forced  their way from one garden to the other through thegooseberry-bushes that divided them.\"\\n In one of the gardens grew anelder-tree, and in the other an old willow, under which  the childrenwere very fond of playing.\"\\nThey had permission to do so, althoughthe tree  stood close by the stream, and they might easily havefallen into the water; but the  eye of God watches over the littleones, otherwise they would never be safe.\"\\nAt the  same time, thesechildren were very careful not to go too near the water; indeed, theboy  was so afraid of it, that in the summer, while the otherchildren were splashing about  in the sea, nothing could entice himto join them.\"\\nThey jeered and laughed at him,  and he was obliged tobear it all as patiently as he could.\"\\nOnce the neighbor\\'s little  girl,Joanna, dreamed that she was sailing in a boat, and the boy- Knudwas his name\\ufffewaded out in the water to join her, and the water cameup to his neck, and at last  closed over his head, and in a moment hehad disappeared.\"\\nWhen little Knud heard this  dream, it seemed as if hecould not bear the mocking and jeering again; how could he  dare togo into the water now, after Joanna\\'s dream!\"\\nHe never would do it, forthis  dream always satisfied him.\"\\nThe parents of these children, whowere poor, often sat  together while Knud and Joanna played in thegardens or in the road.\"\\nAlong this road\\ufffea row of willow-trees hadbeen planted to separate it from a ditch on one side of it.\"\\n Theywere not very handsome trees, for the tops had been cut off;however, they were  intended for use, and not for show.\"\\nThe oldwillow-tree in the garden was much handsomer,  and therefore thechildren were very fond of sitting under it.\"\\nThe town had a  largemarket-place; and at the fair-time there would be whole rows, likestreets, of  tents and booths containing silks and ribbons, and toysand cakes, and everything that  could be wished for.\"\\nThere werecrowds of people, and sometimes the weather would be  rainy, and splashwith moisture the woollen jackets of the peasants; but it did  notdestroy the beautiful fragrance of the honey-cakes and gingerbreadwith which one  booth was filled; and the best of it was, that theman who sold these cakes always  lodged during the fair-time withlittle Knud\\'s parents.\"\\nSo every now and then he had  a present ofgingerbread, and of course Joanna always had a share.\"\\nAnd, moredelightful  still, the gingerbread seller knew all sorts of things totell and could even relate  stories about his own gingerbread.\"\\nSo oneevening he told them a story that made such  a deep impression on thechildren that they never forgot it; and therefore I think  we may aswell hear it too, for it is not very long.\"\\n \"Once upon a time,\" said he, \"there lay on my counter twogingerbread cakes, one in  the shape of a man wearing a hat, theother of a maiden without a bonnet.\"\\nTheir faces  were on the sidethat was uppermost, for on the other side they looked verydifferent.\"\\n Most people have a best side to their characters, whichthey take care to show to the  world.\"\\nOn the left, just where the heartis, the gingerbread man had an almond stuck  in to represent it, butthe maiden was honey cake all over.\"\\nThey were placed on the  counter assamples, and after lying there a long time they at last fell in lovewith  each other; but neither of them spoke of it to the other, as theyshould have done  if they expected anything to follow.\"\\n\\'He is a man, heought to speak the first word,\\'  thought the gingerbread maiden; butshe felt quite happy- she was sure that her love  was returned.\"\\nBut histhoughts were far more ambitious, as the thoughts of a man  oftenare.\"\\nHe dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he possessedfour real pennies,  and that he had bought the gingerbread lady, andate her up.\"\\nAnd so they lay on the  counter for days and weeks, tillthey grew hard and dry; but the thoughts of the maiden  became evermore tender and womanly.\"\\n\\'Ah well, it is enough for me that I havebeen  able to live on the same counter with him,\\' said she one day;when suddenly, \\'crack,\\'  and she broke in two.\"\\n\\'Ah,\\' said thegingerbread man to himself, \\'if she had only known  of my love, shewould have kept together a little longer.\\' And here they both are,  andthat is their history,\" said the cake man.\"\\n\"You think the history oftheir lives  and their silent love, which never came to anything,very remarkable; and there they  are for you.\"\\n So saying, he gaveJoanna the gingerbread man, who was still quite whole\\ufffeand to Knud thebroken maiden; but the children had been so much impressed by thestory,  that they had not the heart to eat the lovers up.\"\\n The next day they went into the churchyard, and took the twocake figures with them,  and sat down under the church wall, whichwas covered with luxuriant ivy in summer  and winter, and looked asif hung with rich tapestry.\"\\nThey stuck up the two  gingerbreadfigures in the sunshine among the green leaves, and then told thestory,  and all about the silent love which came to nothing, to a groupof children.\"\\nThey called  it, \"love,\" because the story was solovely, and the other children had the same opinion.\"\\n But when theyturned to look at the gingerbread pair, the broken maiden was gone!A  great boy, out of wickedness, had eaten her up.\"\\nAt first thechildren cried about it;  but afterwards, thinking very probably thatthe poor lover ought not to be left alone  in the world, they ate himup too: but they never forgot the story.\"\\n The two children still continued to play together by theelder-tree, and under the  willow; and the little maiden sang beautifulsongs, with a voice that was as clear  as a bell.\"\\nKnud, on thecontrary, had not a note of music in him, but knew the words  of thesongs, and that of course is something.\"\\nThe people of Kjoge, andeven the rich  wife of the man who kept the fancy shop, would stand andlisten while Joanna was singing,  and say, \"She has really a very sweetvoice.\"\\n  Those were happy days; but they could not last forever.\"\\nTheneighbors were separated,  the mother of the little girl was dead,and her father had thoughts of marrying again  and of residing in thecapital, where he had been promised a very lucrative appointment  asmessenger.\"\\nThe neighbors parted with tears, the children wept sadly;but their  parents promised that they should write to each other atleast once a year.\"\\n After this, Knud was bound apprentice to a shoemaker; he wasgrowing a great boy, and  could not be allowed to run wild anylonger.\"\\nBesides, he was going to be confirmed.\"\\n Ah, how happy hewould have been on that festal day in Copenhagen with little Joanna;but  he still remained at Kjoge, and had never seen the great city,though the town is not  five miles from it.\"\\nBut far across the bay,when the sky was clear, the towers of  Copenhagen could be seen; and onthe day of his confirmation he saw distinctly the  golden cross onthe principal church glittering in the sun.\"\\nHow often his thoughtswere  with Joanna!\"\\nbut did she think of him?\"\\nYes.\"\\nAbout Christmascame a letter from her  father to Knud\\'s parents, which stated thatthey were going on very well in Copenhagen,  and mentioningparticularly that Joanna\\'s beautiful voice was likely to bring her  abrilliant fortune in the future.\"\\nShe was engaged to sing at a concert,and she had  already earned money by singing, out of which she sent herdear neighbors at Kjoge  a whole dollar, for them to make merry onChristmas eve, and they were to drink her  health.\"\\nShe had herselfadded this in a postscript, and in the same postscript she  wrote,\"Kind regards to Knud.\"\\n  The good neighbors wept, although the news was so pleasant; butthey wept tears of  joy.\"\\nKnud\\'s thoughts had been daily with Joanna,and now he knew that she also had  thought of him; and the nearer thetime came for his apprenticeship to end, the clearer  did it appearto him that he loved Joanna, and that she must be his wife; and asmile  came on his lips at the thought, and at one time he drew thethread so fast as he worked,  and pressed his foot so hard againstthe knee strap, that he ran the awl into his finger;  but what did hecare for that?\"\\nHe was determined not to play the dumb lover as boththe  gingerbread cakes had done; the story was a good lesson to him.\"\\n At length he become a journeyman; and then, for the first time, heprepared for a  journey to Copenhagen, with his knapsack packed andready.\"\\nA master was expecting him  there, and he thought of Joanna, andhow glad she would be to see him.\"\\nShe was now  seventeen, and henineteen years old.\"\\nHe wanted to buy a gold ring for her in Kjoge,  butthen he recollected how far more beautiful such things would be inCopenhagen.\"\\nSo  he took leave of his parents, and on a rainy day,late in the autumn, wandered forth  on foot from the town of his birth.The leaves were falling from the trees; and, by  the time he arrived athis new master\\'s in the great metropolis, he was wet through.\"\\n On thefollowing Sunday he intended to pay his first visit to Joanna\\'sfather.\"\\nWhen  the day came, the new journeyman\\'s clothes were broughtout, and a new hat, which he  had brought in Kjoge.\"\\nThe hat becamehim very well, for hitherto he had only worn a  cap.\"\\nHe found the housethat he sought easily, but had to mount so many stairs that  hebecame quite giddy; it surprised him to find how people lived over oneanother in  this dreadful town.\"\\n On entering a room in which everything denoted prosperity,Joanna\\'s father received  him very kindly.\"\\nThe new wife was astranger to him, but she shook hands with him,  and offered him coffee.\"\\n \"Joanna will be very glad to see you,\" said her father.\"\\n\"Youhave grown quite a nice  young man, you shall see her presently; she isa good child, and is the joy of my heart,  and, please God, she willcontinue to be so; she has her own room now, and pays us  rent for it.\"\\nAnd the father knocked quite politely at a door, as if he were astranger,  and then they both went in.\"\\nHow pretty everything was inthat room!\"\\na more beautiful  apartment could not be found in thewhole town of Kjoge; the queen herself could  scarcely be betteraccommodated.\"\\nThere were carpets, and rugs, and window  curtainshanging to the ground.\"\\nPictures and flowers were scattered about.There was  a velvet chair, and a looking-glass against the wall, intowhich a person might be  in danger of stepping, for it was as largeas a door.\"\\nAll this Knud saw at a glance,  and yet, in truth, he sawnothing but Joanna.\"\\nShe was quite grown up, and very different  fromwhat Knud had fancied her, and a great deal more beautiful.\"\\nIn allKjoge there  was not a girl like her; and how graceful she looked,although her glance at first  was odd, and not familiar; but for amoment only, then she rushed towards him as if  she would have kissedhim; she did not, however, although she was very near it.\"\\nYes,  shereally was joyful at seeing the friend of her childhood once more, andthe tears  even stood in her eyes.\"\\nThen she asked so many questionsabout Knud\\'s parents, and  everything, even to the elder-tree and thewillow, which she called \"elder-mother and  willow-father,\" as ifthey had been human beings; and so, indeed, they might be, quite  asmuch as the gingerbread cakes.\"\\nThen she talked about them, and thestory of their  silent love, and how they lay on the counter togetherand split in two; and then she  laughed heartily; but the bloodrushed into Knud\\'s cheeks, and his heart beat quickly.\"\\n Joanna wasnot proud at all; he noticed that through her he was invited by herparents  to remain the whole evening with them, and she poured outthe tea and gave him a cup  herself; and afterwards she took a book andread aloud to them, and it seemed to Knud  as if the story was allabout himself and his love, for it agreed so well with his  ownthoughts.\"\\nAnd then she sang a simple song, which, through her singing,became a  true story, and as if she poured forth the feelings of herown heart.\"\\n \"Oh,\" he thought, \"she knows I am fond of her.\"\\n The tears he couldnot restrain rolled  down his cheeks, and he was unable to utter asingle word; it seemed as if he had been  struck dumb.\"\\n When he left, she pressed his hand, and said, \"You have a kindheart, Knud: remain  always as you are now.\"\\n What an evening ofhappiness this had been; to sleep after  it was impossible, and Knuddid not sleep.\"\\n At parting, Joanna\\'s father had said, \"Now, you won\\'t quite forgetus; you must not  let the whole winter go by without paying usanother visit;\" so that Knud felt himself  free to go again thefollowing Sunday evening, and so he did.\"\\nBut every evening  afterworking hours- and they worked by candle-light then- he walked outinto the town,  and through the street in which Joanna lived, to lookup at her window.\"\\nIt was almost  always lighted up; and one eveninghe saw the shadow of her face quite plainly on the  window blind;that was a glorious evening for him.\"\\nHis master\\'s wife did not likehis  always going out in the evening, idling, wasting time, as shecalled it, and she shook  her head.\"\\n But his master only smiled, and said, \"He is a young man, my dear,you know.\"\\n  \"On Sunday I shall see her,\" said Knud to himself, \"and I willtell her that I love  her with my whole heart and soul, and that shemust be my little wife.\"\\nI know I am  now only a poor journeymanshoemaker, but I will work and strive, and become a master  in time.Yes, I will speak to her; nothing comes from silent love.\"\\nI learntthat from  the gingerbread-cake story.\"\\n  Sunday came, but when Knud arrived, they were all unfortunatelyinvited out to spend  the evening, and were obliged to tell him so.\"\\n Joanna pressed his hand, and said, \"Have you ever been to thetheatre?\"\\nyou must go  once; I sing there on Wednesday, and if youhave time on that day, I will send you  a ticket; my father knows whereyour master lives.\"\\n How kind this was of her!\"\\nAnd on  Wednesday,about noon, Knud received a sealed packet with no address, but theticket  was inside; and in the evening Knud went, for the first time inhis life, to a theatre.\"\\n And what did he see?\"\\nHe saw Joanna, and howbeautiful and charming she looked!\"\\nHe  certainly saw her beingmarried to a stranger, but that was all in the play, and only  apretence; Knud well knew that.\"\\nShe could never have the heart, hethought, to send  him a ticket to go and see it, if it had been real.So he looked on, and when all the  people applauded and clapped theirhands, he shouted \"hurrah.\"\\n He could see that even  the king smiledat Joanna, and seemed delighted with her singing.\"\\nHow small Knud  felt;but then he loved her so dearly, and thought she loved him, and theman must speak  the first word, as the gingerbread maiden hadthought.\"\\nAh, how much there was for him  in that childish story.\"\\nAssoon as Sunday arrived, he went again, and felt as if he  were about toenter on holy ground.\"\\nJoanna was alone to welcome him, nothing couldbe  more fortunate.\"\\n \"I am so glad you are come,\" she said.\"\\nI was thinking of sendingmy father for you,  but I had a presentiment that you would be herethis evening.\"\\nThe fact is, I wanted  to tell you that I am going toFrance.\"\\nI shall start on Friday.\"\\nIt is necessary for  me to go there,if I wish to become a first-rate performer.\"\\n  Poor Knud!\"\\nit seemed to him as if the whole room was whirlinground with him.\"\\nHis courage  failed, and he felt as if his heartwould burst.\"\\nHe kept down the tears, but it was  easy to see howsorrowful he was.\"\\n \"You honest, faithful soul,\" she exclaimed; and the words loosenedKnud\\'s tongue, and  he told her how truly he had loved her, and thatshe must be his wife; and as he said  this, he saw Joanna change color,and turn pale.\"\\nShe let his hand fall, and said,  earnestly andmournfully, \"Knud, do not make yourself and me unhappy.\"\\nI willalways  be a good sister to you, one in whom you can trust; but I cannever be anything more.\"\\n  And she drew her white hand over hisburning forehead, and said, \"God gives strength  to bear a greatdeal, if we only strive ourselves to endure.\"\\n  At this moment her stepmother came into the room, and Joannasaid quickly, \"Knud is  so unhappy, because I am going away;\" and itappeared as if they had only been talking  of her journey.\"\\n\"Come, bea man\" she added, placing her hand on his shoulder; \"you  are still achild, and you must be good and reasonable, as you were when we wereboth  children, and played together under the willow-tree.\"\\n  Knud listened, but he felt as if the world had slid out of itscourse.\"\\nHis thoughts  were like a loose thread fluttering to and fro inthe wind.\"\\nHe stayed, although he  could not tell whether she hadasked him to do so.\"\\nBut she was kind and gentle to him;  she poured outhis tea, and sang to him; but the song had not the old tone in it,although  it was wonderfully beautiful, and made his heart feel readyto burst.\"\\nAnd then he rose  to go.\"\\nHe did not offer his hand, but sheseized it, and said-  \"Will you not shake hands with your sister at parting, my oldplayfellow?\"\\n and she  smiled through the tears that were rolling downher cheeks.\"\\nAgain she repeated the  word \"brother,\" which was a greatconsolation certainly; and thus they parted.\"\\n She sailed to France, and Knud wandered about the muddy streets ofCopenhagen.\"\\nThe  other journeymen in the shop asked him why he lookedso gloomy, and wanted him to go  and amuse himself with them, as he wasstill a young man.\"\\nSo he went with them to a  dancing-room.\"\\nHe saw manyhandsome girls there, but none like Joanna; and here, where  he thoughtto forget her, she was more life-like before his mind than ever.\"\\nGod gives  us strength to bear much, if we try to do our best,\" shehad said; and as he thought  of this, a devout feeling came into hismind, and he folded his hands.\"\\nThen, as the  violins played and thegirls danced round the room, he started; for it seemed to him  as if hewere in a place where he ought not to have brought Joanna, for she washere  with him in his heart; and so he went out at once.\"\\nAs he wentthrough the streets at  a quick pace, he passed the house where sheused to live; it was all dark, empty, and  lonely.\"\\nBut the world wenton its course, and Knud was obliged to go on too.\"\\n Winter came; the water was frozen, and everything seemed buried ina cold grave.\"\\nBut  when spring returned, and the first steamer preparedto sail, Knud was seized with  a longing to wander forth into theworld, but not to France.\"\\nSo he packed his knapsack,  and travelledthrough Germany, going from town to town, but finding neither restor  peace.\"\\nIt was not till he arrived at the glorious old town ofNuremberg that he gained  the mastery over himself, and rested hisweary feet; and here he remained.\"\\n Nuremberg is a wonderful old city, and looks as if it had been cutout of an old  picture-book.\"\\nThe streets seem to have arrangedthemselves according to their own  fancy, and as if the houses objectedto stand in rows or rank and file.\"\\nGables, with  little towers,ornamented columns, and statues, can be seen even to the city gate;and  from the singular-shaped roofs, waterspouts, formed likedragons, or long lean dogs,  extend far across to the middle of thestreet.\"\\nHere, in the market-place, stood Knud,  with his knapsack onhis back, close to one of the old fountains which are so  beautifullyadorned with figures, scriptural and historical, and which spring  upbetween the sparkling jets of water.\"\\nA pretty servant-maid was justfilling her pails,  and she gave Knud a refreshing draught; she had ahandful of roses, and she gave him  one, which appeared to him like agood omen for the future.\"\\nFrom a neighboring church  came the sounds ofmusic, and the familiar tones reminded him of the organ at home  atKjoge; so he passed into the great cathedral.\"\\nThe sunshine streamedthrough the  painted glass windows, and between two lofty slenderpillars.\"\\nHis thoughts became  prayerful, and calm peace rested on hissoul.\"\\nHe next sought and found a good master  in Nuremberg, with whomhe stayed and learnt the German language.\"\\n The old moat round the town had been converted into a number oflittle kitchen gardens;  but the high walls, with their heavy-lookingtowers, are still standing.\"\\nInside these  walls the ropemaker twistedhis ropes along a walk built like a gallery, and in the  cracks andcrevices of the walls elderbushes grow and stretch their greenboughs over  the small houses which stand below.\"\\nIn one of these houseslived the master for whom  Knud worked; and over the little garretwindow where he sat, the elder-tree waved its  branches.\"\\nHere hedwelt through one summer and winter, but when spring came again,  hecould endure it no longer.\"\\nThe elder was in blossom, and its fragrancewas so homelike,  that he fancied himself back again in the gardensof Kjoge.\"\\nSo Knud left his master,  and went to work for another wholived farther in the town, where no elder grew.\"\\nHis  workshop was quiteclose to one of the old stone bridges, near to a water-mill,  roundwhich the roaring stream rushed and foamed always, yet restrained bythe  neighboring houses, whose old, decayed balconies hung over, andseemed ready to fall  into the water.\"\\nHere grew no elder; here wasnot even a flower-pot, with its little  green plant; but justopposite the workshop stood a great willow-tree, which seemed  tohold fast to the house for fear of being carried away by the water.\"\\nItstretched  its branches over the stream just as those of thewillow-tree in the garden at Kjoge  had spread over the river.\"\\nYes,he had indeed gone from elder-mother to willow-father.\"\\n There was asomething about the tree here, especially in the moonlight nights,that  went direct to his heart; yet it was not in reality themoonlight, but the old tree  itself.\"\\nHowever, he could not endure it:and why?\"\\nAsk the willow, ask the blossoming  elder!\"\\nAt all events, hebade farewell to Nuremberg and journeyed onwards.\"\\nHe never  spoke ofJoanna to any one; his sorrow was hidden in his heart.\"\\nThe oldchildish story  of the two cakes had a deep meaning for him.\"\\nHeunderstood now why the gingerbread  man had a bitter almond in his leftside; his was the feeling of bitterness, and Joanna,  so mild andfriendly, was represented by the honeycake maiden.\"\\nAs he thoughtupon all  this, the strap of his knapsack pressed across his chest sothat he could hardly breathe;  he loosened it, but gained no relief.\"\\nHesaw but half the world around him; the other  half he carried withhim in his inward thoughts; and this is the condition in which  he leftNuremberg.\"\\nNot till he caught sight of the lofty mountains did theworld appear  more free to him; his thoughts were attracted to outerobjects, and tears came into  his eyes.\"\\nThe Alps appeared to him likethe wings of earth folded together; unfolded,  they would display thevariegated pictures of dark woods, foaming waters, spreading  clouds,and masses of snow.\"\\n\"At the last day,\" thought he, \"the earth willunfold its  great wings, and soar upwards to the skies, there toburst like a soap-bubble in the  radiant glance of the Deity.\"\\nOh,\"sighed he, \"that the last day were come!\"\\n  Silently he wandered on through the country of the Alps, whichseemed to him like a  fruit garden, covered with soft turf.\"\\nFrom thewooden balconies of the houses the young  lacemakers nodded as hepassed.\"\\nThe summits of the mountains glowed in the red evening  sunset,and the green lakes beneath the dark trees reflected the glow.\"\\nThen hethought  of the sea coast by the bay Kjoge, with a longing in his heartthat was, however, without  pain.\"\\nThere, where the Rhine rolls onwardlike a great billow, and dissolves itself  into snowflakes, whereglistening clouds are ever changing as if here was the place  oftheir creation, while the rainbow flutters about them like amany-colored ribbon,  there did Knud think of the water-mill atKjoge, with its rushing, foaming waters.\"\\n Gladly would he have remainedin the quiet Rhenish town, but there were too many elders  andwillow-trees.\"\\n So he travelled onwards, over a grand, lofty chain of mountains,over rugged,- rocky  precipices, and along roads that hung on themountain\\'s side like a swallow\\'s nest.\"\\n The waters foamed in the depthsbelow him.\"\\nThe clouds lay beneath him.\"\\nHe wandered  on, treading uponAlpine roses, thistles, and snow, with the summer sun shining uponhim,  till at length he bid farewell to the lands of the north.\"\\nThen hepassed on under the  shade of blooming chestnut-trees, throughvineyards, and fields of Indian corn, till  conscious that themountains were as a wall between him and his early recollections;and  he wished it to be so.\"\\n Before him lay a large and splendid city, called Milan, and herehe found a German  master who engaged him as a workman.\"\\nThe masterand his wife, in whose workshop he  was employed, were an old, piouscouple; and the two old people became quite fond of  the quietjourneyman, who spoke but little, but worked more, and led a pious,Christian  life; and even to himself it seemed as if God had removedthe heavy burden from his  heart.\"\\nHis greatest pleasure was to climb,now and then, to the roof of the noble church,  which was built ofwhite marble.\"\\nThe pointed towers, the decorated and open  cloisters,the stately columns, the white statues which smiled upon him fromevery  corner and porch and arch,- all, even the church itself,seemed to him to have been  formed from the snow of his native land.Above him was the blue sky; below him, the  city and the wide-spreadingplains of Lombardy; and towards the north, the lofty  mountains,covered with perpetual snow.\"\\nAnd then he thought of the church ofKjoge,  with its red, ivy-clad walls, but he had no longing to gothere; here, beyond the  mountains, he would die and be buried.\"\\n Three years had passed away since he left his home; one year ofthat time he had dwelt  at Milan.\"\\n One day his master took him into the town; not to the circus inwhich riders performed,  but to the opera, a large building, itself asight well worth seeing.\"\\nThe seven tiers  of boxes, which reachedfrom the ground to a dizzy height, near the ceiling, were hung  withrich, silken curtains; and in them were seated elegantly-dressedladies, with  bouquets of flowers in their hands.\"\\nThe gentlemen werealso in full dress, and many  of them wore decorations of gold andsilver.\"\\nThe place was so brilliantly lighted that  it seemed likesunshine, and glorious music rolled through the building.\"\\n Everythinglooked more beautiful than in the theatre at Copenhagen, but thenJoanna  had been there, and- could it be?\"\\nYes- it was like magic,-she was here also: for,  when the curtain rose, there stood Joanna,dressed in silk and gold, and with a golden  crown upon her head.\"\\nShesang, he thought, as only an angel could sing; and then she  steppedforward to the front and smiled, as only Joanna could smile, andlooked directly  at Knud.\"\\nPoor Knud!\"\\nhe seized his master\\'s hand, andcried out loud, \"Joanna,\" but  no one heard him, excepting hismaster, for the music sounded above everything.\"\\n \"Yes, yes, it is Joanna,\" said his master; and he drew forth aprinted bill, and pointed  to her name, which was there in full.\"\\nThenit was not a dream.\"\\nAll the audience applauded  her, and threwwreaths of flowers at her; and every time she went away they calledfor  her again, so that she was always coming and going.\"\\nIn thestreet the people crowded  round her carriage, and drew it awaythemselves without the horses.\"\\nKnud was in the  foremost row, andshouted as joyously as the rest; and when the carriage stoppedbefore  a brilliantly lighted house, Knud placed himself close to thedoor of her carriage.\"\\n It flew open, and she stepped out; the lightfell upon her dear face, and he could  see that she smiled as shethanked them, and appeared quite overcome.\"\\nKnud looked  straight in herface, and she looked at him, but she did not recognize him.\"\\nA man,with  a glittering star on his breast, gave her his arm, and peoplesaid the two were engaged  to be married.\"\\nThen Knud went home andpacked up his knapsack; he felt he must return  to the home of hischildhood, to the elder-tree and the willow.\"\\n\"Ah, under  thatwillow-tree!\"\\n A man may live a whole life in one single hour.\"\\n The old couple begged him to remain, but words were useless.\"\\nInvain they reminded  him that winter was coming, and that the snow hadalready fallen on the mountains.\"\\n He said he could easily follow thetrack of the closely-moving carriages, for which  a path must be keptclear, and with nothing but his knapsack on his back, and leaning  onhis stick, he could step along briskly.\"\\nSo he turned his steps tothe mountains,  ascended one side and descended the other, stillgoing northward till his strength  began to fail, and not a house orvillage could be seen.\"\\nThe stars shone in the sky  above him, anddown in the valley lights glittered like stars, as if another sky  werebeneath him; but his head was dizzy and his feet stumbled, and he feltill.\"\\nThe  lights in the valley grew brighter and brighter, and morenumerous, and he could see  them moving to and fro, and then heunderstood that there must be a village in the  distance; so he exertedhis failing strength to reach it, and at length obtained  shelter ina humble lodging.\"\\nHe remained there that night and the whole of thefollowing  day, for his body required rest and refreshment, and inthe valley there was rain and  a thaw.\"\\nBut early in the morning ofthe third day, a man came with an organ and played  one of the melodiesof home; and after that Knud could remain there no longer, so  hestarted again on his journey toward the north.\"\\nHe travelled for manydays with hasty  steps, as if he were trying to reach home before allwhom he remembered should die;  but he spoke to no one of this longing.No one would have believed or understood this  sorrow of his heart, thedeepest that can be felt by human nature.\"\\nSuch grief is not  for theworld; it is not entertaining even to friends, and poor Knud had nofriends;  he was a stranger, wandering through strange lands to hishome in the north.\"\\n He was walking one evening through the public roads, the countryaround him was flatter,  with fields and meadows, the air had afrosty feeling.\"\\nA willow-tree grew by the  roadside, everythingreminded him of home.\"\\nHe felt very tired; so he sat down under  thetree, and very soon began to nod, then his eyes closed in sleep.\"\\nYetstill he seemed  conscious that the willow-tree was stretching itsbranches over him; in his dreaming  state the tree appeared like astrong, old man- the \"willow-father\" himself, who had  taken histired son up in his arms to carry him back to the land of home, to thegarden  of his childhood, on the bleak open shores of Kjoge.\"\\nAnd thenhe dreamed that it was  really the willow-tree itself from Kjoge, whichhad travelled out in the world to seek  him, and now had found himand carried him back into the little garden on the banks  of thestreamlet; and there stood Joanna, in all her splendor, with thegolden crown  on her head, as he had last seen her, to welcome himback.\"\\nAnd then there appeared  before him two remarkable shapes,which looked much more like human beings than when  he had seen them inhis childhood; they were changed, but he remembered that they were  thetwo gingerbread cakes, the man and the woman, who had shown their bestsides to  the world and looked so good.\"\\n \"We thank you,\" they said to Knud, \"for you have loosened ourtongues; we have learnt  from you that thoughts should be spokenfreely, or nothing will come of them; and now  something has come ofour thoughts, for we are engaged to be married.\"\\n Then they  walkedaway, hand-in-hand, through the streets of Kjoge, looking veryrespectable on  the best side, which they were quite right to show.They turned their steps to the  church, and Knud and Joanna followedthem, also walking hand-in-hand; there stood the  church, as of old,with its red walls, on which the green ivy grew.\"\\n The great church door flew open wide, and as they walked up thebroad aisle, soft tones  of music sounded from the organ.\"\\n\"Our masterfirst,\" said the gingerbread pair, making  room for Knud and Joanna.\"\\nAsthey knelt at the altar, Joanna bent her head over him,  and cold,icy tears fell on his face from her eyes.\"\\nThey were indeed tears ofice, for  her heart was melting towards him through his strong love,and as her tears fell on  his burning cheeks he awoke.\"\\nHe was stillsitting under the willow-tree in a strange  land, on a cold winterevening, with snow and hail falling from the clouds, and  beatingupon his face.\"\\n \"That was the most delightful hour of my life,\" said he, \"althoughit was only a dream.\"\\n Oh, let me dream again.\"\\n Then he closed hiseyes once more, and slept and dreamed.\"\\n Towards morning there was a great fall of snow; the wind driftedit over him, but he  still slept on.\"\\nThe villagers came forth to goto church; by the roadside they found  a workman seated, but he wasdead!\"\\nfrozen to death under a willow-tree.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  WHAT ONE CAN INVENT  by Hans Christian Andersen  There was once a young man who was studying to be a poet.\"\\nHewanted to become one by  Easter, and to marry, and to live by poetry.To write poems, he knew, only consists  in being able to inventsomething; but he could not invent anything.\"\\nHe had been born  toolate- everything had been taken up before he came into the world,and everything  had been written and told about.\"\\n \"Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!\"\\n said he.\"\\n\"Itwas an easy matter  for them to become immortal.\"\\nHappy even was hewho was born a hundred years ago, for  then there was still somethingabout which a poem could be written.\"\\nNow the world is  written out, andwhat can I write poetry about?\"\\n  Then he studied till he became ill and wretched, the wretched man!No doctor could  help him, but perhaps the wise woman could.\"\\nShelived in the little house by the wayside,  where the gate is that sheopened for those who rode and drove.\"\\nBut she could do more  than unlockthe gate.\"\\nShe was wiser than the doctor who drives in his own carriageand  pays tax for his rank.\"\\n \"I must go to her,\" said the young man.\"\\n The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but dreary tobehold, for there were  no flowers near it- no trees.\"\\nBy the door stooda bee-hive, which was very useful.\"\\n There was also a littlepotato-field, very useful, and an earth bank, with sloe bushes  uponit, which had done blossoming, and now bore fruit, sloes, that drawone\\'s mouth  together if one tastes them before the frost has touchedthem.\"\\n \"That\\'s a true picture of our poetryless time, that I see beforeme now,\" thought the  young man; and that was at least a thought, agrain of gold that he found by the door  of the wise woman.\"\\n \"Write that down!\"\\n said she.\"\\n\"Even crumbs are bread.\"\\nI know whyyou come hither.\"\\nYou  cannot invent anything, and yet you want to bea poet by Easter.\"\\n  \"Everything has been written down,\" said he.\"\\n\"Our time is notthe old time.\"\\n  \"No,\" said the woman.\"\\n\"In the old time wise women were burnt,and poets went about  with empty stomachs, and very much out at elbows.The present time is good, it is the  best of times; but you have notthe right way of looking at it.\"\\nYour ear is not sharpened  to hear, andI fancy you do not say the Lord\\'s Prayer in the evening.\"\\nThere isplenty  here to write poems about, and to tell of, for any one whoknows the way.\"\\nYou can read  it in the fruits of the earth, you candraw it from the flowing and the standing water;  but you mustunderstand how- you must understand how to catch a sunbeam.\"\\nNow justyou  try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet to your ear, and thenpray to God, and  leave off thinking of yourself\"  The last was a very difficult thing to do- more than a wisewoman ought to ask.\"\\n He received the spectacles and the ear-trumpet, and was postedin the middle of the  potato-field.\"\\nShe put a great potato into hishand.\"\\nSounds came from within it; there  came a song with words, thehistory of the potato, an every-day story in ten parts,  an interestingstory.\"\\nAnd ten lines were enough to tell it in.\"\\n And what did the potato sing?\"\\n She sang of herself and of her family, of the arrival of thepotato in Europe, of the  misrepresentation to which she had beenexposed before she was acknowledged, as she  is now, to be a greatertreasure than a lump of gold.\"\\n \"We were distributed, by the King\\'s command, from thecouncil-houses through the  various towns, and proclamation was made ofour great value; but no one believed in  it, or even understood howto plant us.\"\\nOne man dug a hole in the earth and threw in  his wholebushel of potatoes; another put one potato here and another there inthe  ground, and expected that each was to come up a perfect tree, fromwhich he might shake  down potatoes.\"\\nAnd they certainly grew, andproduced flowers and green watery fruit,  but it all withered away.Nobody thought of what was in the ground- the blessing- the  potato.Yes, we have endured and suffered, that is to say, our forefathershave; they  and we, it is all one.\"\\n  What a story it was!\"\\n \"Well, and that will do,\" said the woman.\"\\n\"Now look at the sloebush.\"\\n  \"We have also some near relations in the home of the potatoes, buthigher towards the  north than they grew,\" said the Sloes.\"\\n\"Therewere Northmen, from Norway, who steered  westward through mist andstorm to an unknown land, where, behind ice and snow, they  foundplants and green meadows, and bushes with blue-black grapes- sloebushes.\"\\nThe  grapes were ripened by the frost just as we are.\"\\nAndthey called the land \\'wine-land,\\'  that is, \\'Groenland,\\' or\\'Sloeland.\\'\"  \"That is quite a romantic story,\" said the young man.\"\\n \"Yes, certainly.\"\\nBut now come with me,\" said the wise woman, andshe led him to the  bee-hive.\"\\n He looked into it.\"\\nWhat life and labor!\"\\nThere were bees standingin all the passages,  waving their wings, so that a wholesome draughtof air might blow through the great  manufactory; that was theirbusiness.\"\\nThen there came in bees from without, who had  been born withlittle baskets on their feet; they brought flower-dust, which waspoured  out, sorted, and manufactured into honey and wax.\"\\nThey flewin and out.\"\\nThe queen-bee  wanted to fly out, but then all the otherbees must have gone with her.\"\\nIt was not  yet the time for that, butstill she wanted to fly out; so the others bit off her  majesty\\'swings, and she had to stay where she was.\"\\n \"Now get upon the earth bank,\" said the wise woman.\"\\n\"Come and lookout over the highway,  where you can see the people.\"\\n  \"What a crowd it is!\"\\n said the young man.\"\\n\"One story afteranother.\"\\nIt whirls and whirls!\"\\n It\\'s quite a confusion before myeyes.\"\\nI shall go out at the back.\"\\n  \"No, go straight forward,\" said the woman.\"\\n\"Go straight into thecrowd of people; look  at them in the right way.\"\\nHave an ear to hearand the right heart to feel, and you  will soon invent something.But, before you go away, you must give me my spectacles  and myear-trumpet again.\"\\n  And so saying, she took both from him.\"\\n \"Now I do not see the smallest thing,\" said the young man, \"andnow I don\\'t hear anything  more.\"\\n  \"Why, then, you can\\'t be a poet by Easter,\" said the wise woman.\"\\n \"But, by what time can I be one?\"\\n asked he.\"\\n \"Neither by Easter nor by Whitsuntide!\"\\nYou will not learn how toinvent anything.\"\\n  \"What must I do to earn my bread by poetry?\"\\n  \"You can do that before Shrove Tuesday.\"\\nHunt the poets!\"\\nKill theirwritings and thus  you will kill them.\"\\nDon\\'t be put out of countenance.Strike at them boldly, and you\\'ll  have carnival cake, on which you cansupport yourself and your wife too.\"\\n  \"What one can invent!\"\\n cried the young man.\"\\nAnd so he hit outboldly at every second  poet, because he could not be a poet himself.\"\\n We have it from the wise woman.\"\\nShe knows WHAT ONE CAN INVENT.\"\\n THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  WHAT THE MOON SAW  by Hans Christian AndersenINTRODUCTION  INTRODUCTION  IT is a strange thing, when I feel most fervently and most deeply,my hands and my  tongue seem alike tied, so that I cannot rightlydescribe or accurately portray the  thoughts that are rising within me;and yet I am a painter; my eye tells me as much  as that, and all myfriends who have seen my sketches and fancies say the same.\"\\n I am a poor lad, and live in one of the narrowest of lanes; butI do not want for light,  as my room is high up in the house, with anextensive prospect over the neighbouring  roofs.\"\\nDuring the first fewdays I went to live in the town, I felt low-spirited and  solitaryenough.\"\\nInstead of the forest and the green hills of former days, Ihad here  only a forest of chimney-pots to look out upon.\"\\nAnd then Ihad not a single friend;  not one familiar face greeted me.\"\\n So one evening I sat at the window, in a desponding mood; andpresently I opened the  casement and looked out.\"\\nOh, how my heartleaped up with joy!\"\\nHere was a well-known  face at last- a round,friendly countenance, the face of a good friend I had known  at home.In, fact, it was the MOON that looked in upon me.\"\\nHe was quiteunchanged, the  dear old Moon, and had the same face exactly that heused to show when he peered down  upon me through the willow trees onthe moor.\"\\nI kissed my hand to him over and over  again, as he shone farinto my little room; and he, for his part, promised me that  everyevening, when he came abroad, he would look in upon me for a fewmoments.\"\\nThis  promise he has faithfully kept.\"\\nIt is a pity that he canonly stay such a short time  when he comes.\"\\nWhenever he appears, hetells me of one thing or another that he has  seen on the previousnight, or on that same evening.\"\\n\"Just paint the scenes I describe  toyou\"- this is what he said to me- \"and you will have a very prettypicture-book.\"\\n  I have followed his injunction for many evenings.\"\\nIcould make up a new \"Thousand and  One Nights,\" in my own way, out ofthese pictures, but the number might be too great,  after all.\"\\nThepictures I have here given have not been chosen at random, butfollow  in their proper order, just as they were described to me.Some great gifted painter,  or some poet or musician, may makesomething more of them if he likes; what I have  given here are onlyhasty sketches, hurriedly put upon the paper, with some of my  ownthoughts, interspersed; for the Moon did not come to me every evening-a cloud  sometimes hid his face from me.\"\\n FIRST EVENING  \"Last night\"- I am quoting the Moon\\'s own words- \"last night I wasgliding through  the cloudless Indian sky.\"\\nMy face was mirrored inthe waters of the Ganges, and my  beams strove to pierce through thethick intertwining boughs of the bananas, arching  beneath me likethe tortoise\\'s shell.\"\\nForth from the thicket tripped a Hindoo  maid,light as a gazelle, beautiful as Eve.\"\\nAiry and etherial as a vision,and yet  sharply defined amid the surrounding shadows, stood thisdaughter of Hindostan: I  could read on her delicate brow the thoughtthat had brought her hither.\"\\nThe thorny  creeping plants tore hersandals, but for all that she came rapidly forward.\"\\nThe deer  thathad come down to the river to quench her thirst, sprang by with astartled bound,  for in her hand the maiden bore a lighted lamp.\"\\nIcould see the blood in her delicate  finger tips, as she spread themfor a screen before the dancing flame.\"\\nShe came down  to the stream,and set the lamp upon the water, and let it float away.\"\\nThe  flameflickered to and fro, and seemed ready to expire; but still the lampburned on,  and the girl\\'s black sparkling eyes, half veiled behindtheir long silken lashes,  followed it with a gaze of earnestintensity.\"\\nShe knew that if the lamp continued to  burn so long asshe could keep it in sight, her betrothed was still alive; but ifthe  lamp was suddenly extinguished, he was dead.\"\\nAnd the lamp burnedbravely on, and she  fell on her knees, and prayed.\"\\nNear her in thegrass lay a speckled snake, but she  heeded it not- she thought only ofBramah and of her betrothed.\"\\n\\'He lives!\\' she shouted  joyfully, \\'helives!\\' And from the mountains the echo came back upon her, \\'helives!\"\\n  SECOND EVENING  \"Yesterday,\" said the Moon to me, \"I looked down upon a smallcourtyard surrounded  on all sides by houses.\"\\nIn the courtyard sat aclucking hen with eleven chickens; and  a pretty little girl wasrunning and jumping around them.\"\\nThe hen was frightened, and  screamed,and spread out her wings over the little brood.\"\\nThen the girl\\'s fathercame  out and scolded her; and I glided away and thought no more of thematter.\"\\n \"But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked down intothe same courtyard.\"\\n Everything was quiet.\"\\nBut presently the littlegirl came forth again, crept quietly  to the hen-house, pushed back thebolt, and slipped into the apartment of the hen and  chickens.\"\\nTheycried out loudly, and came fluttering down from their perches, and  ranabout in dismay, and the little girl ran after them.\"\\nI saw it quiteplainly, for  I looked through a hole in the hen-house wall.\"\\nI wasangry with the willful child,  and felt glad when her father came outand scolded her more violently than yesterday,  holding her roughlyby the arm; she held down her head, and her blue eyes were full  oflarge tears.\"\\n\\'What are you about here?\\' he asked.\"\\nShe wept and said,\\'I wanted to  kiss the hen and beg her pardon for frightening heryesterday; but I was afraid to  tell you.\\'  \"And the father kissed the innocent child\\'s forehead, and I kissedher on the mouth  and eyes.\"\\n  THIRD EVENING  \"In the narrow street round the corner yonder- it is so narrowthat my beams can only  glide for a minute along the walls of thehouse, but in that minute I see enough to  learn what the world is madeof- in that narrow street I saw a woman.\"\\nSixteen years  ago thatwoman was a child, playing in the garden of the old parsonage, inthe country.\"\\n The hedges of rose-bush were old, and the flowers werefaded.\"\\nThey straggled wild over  the paths, and the ragged branchesgrew up among the boughs of the apple trees; here  and there were a fewroses still in bloom- not so fair as the queen of flowers  generallyappears, but still they had colour and scent too.\"\\nThe clergyman\\'slittle  daughter appeared to me a far lovelier rose, as she sat onher stool under the  straggling hedge, hugging and caressing her dollwith the battered pasteboard cheeks.\"\\n \"Ten years afterwards I saw her again.\"\\nI beheld her in asplendid ballroom: she was  the beautiful bride of a rich merchant.\"\\nIrejoiced at her happiness, and sought her  on calm quiet evenings-ah, nobody thinks of my clear eye and my silent glance!\"\\nAlas!\"\\n myrose ran wild, like the rose bushes in the garden of the parsonage.There are  tragedies in every-day life, and tonight I saw the lastact of one.\"\\n \"She was lying in bed in a house in that narrow street: she wassick unto death, and  the cruel landlord came up, and tore away thethin coverlet, her only protection  against the cold.\"\\n\\'Get up!\\' saidhe; \\'your face is enough to frighten one.\"\\nGet up and  dress yourself,give me money, or I\\'ll turn you out into the street!\"\\nQuick- get up!\\'She  answered, \\'Alas!\"\\ndeath is gnawing at my heart.\"\\nLet me rest.\\' Buthe forced her to get  up and bathe her face, and put a wreath ofroses in her hair; and he placed her in  a chair at the window, witha candle burning beside her, and went away.\"\\n \"I looked at her, and she was sitting motionless, with her handsin her lap.\"\\nThe wind  caught the open window and shut it with acrash, so that a pane came clattering down  in fragments; but still shenever moved.\"\\nThe curtain caught fire, and the flames played  abouther face; and I saw that she was dead.\"\\nThere at the open window satthe dead woman,  preaching a sermon against sin- my poor faded rose outof the parsonage garden!\"\\n  FOURTH EVENING  \"This evening I saw a German play acted,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"It wasin a little town.\"\\n A stable had been turned into a theatre; that isto say, the stable had been left  standing, and had been turned intoprivate boxes, and all the timber work had been  covered withcoloured paper.\"\\nA little iron chandelier hung beneath the ceiling,  andthat it might be made to disappear into the ceiling, as it does ingreat theatres,  when the ting-ting of the prompter\\'s bell is heard,a great inverted tub has been placed  just above it.\"\\n \"\\'Ting-ting!\\' and the little iron chandelier suddenly rose atleast half a yard and  disappeared in the tub; and that was the signthat the play was going to begin.\"\\nA young  nobleman and his lady, whohappened to be passing through the little town, were present  at theperformance, and consequently the house was crowded.\"\\nBut under thechandelier  was a vacant space like a little crater: not a singlesoul sat there, for the tallow  was dropping, drip, drip!\"\\nI saweverything, for it was so warm in there that every  loophole had beenopened.\"\\nThe male and female servants stood outside, peeping  throughthe chinks, although a real policeman was inside, threatening themwith a stick.\"\\n Close by the orchestra could be seen the noble youngcouple in two old arm-chairs,  which were usually occupied by hisworship the mayor and his lady; but these latter  were to-day obligedto content themselves with wooden forms, just as if they had  beenordinary citizens; and the lady observed quietly to herself, \\'Onesees, now, that  there is rank above rank;\\' and this incident gave anair of extra festivity to the  whole proceedings.\"\\nThe chandelier gavelittle leaps, the crowd got their knuckles  rapped, and I, the Moon,was present at the performance from beginning to end.\"\\n  FIFTH EVENING  \"Yesterday,\" began the Moon, \"I looked down upon the turmoil ofParis.\"\\nMy eye  penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre.\"\\nAn oldgrandmother, poorly clad- she  belonged to the working class- wasfollowing one of the under-servants into the great  emptythrone-room, for this was the apartment she wanted to see- that shewas resolved  to see; it had cost her many a little sacrifice, and manya coaxing word, to penetrate  thus far.\"\\nShe folded her thin hands,and looked round with an air of reverence, as  if she had been in achurch.\"\\n \"\\'Here it was!\\' she said, \\'here!\\' and she approached the throne,from which hung the  rich velvet fringed with gold lace.\"\\n\\'There,\\' sheexclaimed, \\'there!\\' and she knelt  and kissed the purple carpet.\"\\nIthink she was actually weeping.\"\\n \"\\'But it was not this very velvet!\\' observed the footman, and asmile played about  his mouth.\"\\n\\'True, but it was this very place,\\'replied the woman, \\'and it must have  looked just like this.\"\\n\\'It lookedso, and yet it did not,\\' observed the man: \\'the  windows were beatenin, and the doors were off their hinges, and there was blood uponthe  floor.\\' \\'But for all that you can say, my grandson died upon thethrone of France.\"\\n Died!\\' mournfully repeated the old woman.\"\\nI do notthink another word was spoken, and  they soon quitted the hall.\"\\nTheevening twilight faded and my light shone doubly vivid  upon the richvelvet that covered the throne of France.\"\\n \"Now who do you think this poor woman was?\"\\nListen, I will tell youa story.\"\\n \"It happened, in the Revolution of July, on the evening of themost brilliantly  victorious day, when every house was a fortress,every window a breastwork.\"\\nThe people  stormed the Tuileries.\"\\nEvenwomen and children were to be found among the combatants.\"\\n Theypenetrated into the apartments and halls of the palace.\"\\nA poorhalf-grown boy in  a ragged blouse fought among the older insurgents.Mortally wounded with several  bayonet thrusts, he sank down.\"\\nThishappened in the throne-room.\"\\nThey laid the bleeding  youth upon thethrone of France, wrapped the velvet around his wounds, and hisblood  streamed forth upon the imperial purple.\"\\nThere was a picture!The splendid hall, the  fighting groups!\"\\nA torn flag upon the ground,the tricolor was waving above the  bayonets, and on the throne laythe poor lad with the pale glorified countenance, his  eyes turnedtowards the sky, his limbs writhing in the death agony, his breastbare,  and his poor tattered clothing half hidden by the rich velvetembroidered with silver  lilies.\"\\nAt the boy\\'s cradle a prophecy hadbeen spoken: \\'He will die on the throne  of France!\\' The mother\\'s heartdreamt of a second Napoleon.\"\\n \"My beams have kissed the wreath of immortelles on his grave,and this night they kissed  the forehead of the old grandame, whilein a dream the picture floated before her which  thou mayest draw-the poor boy on the throne of France.\"\\n  SIXTH EVENING  \"I\\'ve been in Upsala,\" said the Moon: \"I looked down upon thegreat plain covered with  coarse grass, and upon the barren fields.\"\\nImirrored my face in the Tyris river, while  the steamboat drove thefish into the rushes.\"\\nBeneath me floated the waves, throwing  longshadows on the so-called graves of Odin, Thor, and Friga.\"\\nIn thescanty turf that  covers the hill-side names have been cut.\"\\nThere is nomonument here, no memorial on  which the traveller can have his namecarved, no rocky wall on whose surface he can  get it painted; sovisitors have the turf cut away for that purpose.\"\\nThe naked  earthpeers through in the form of great letters and names; these form anetwork over  the whole hill.\"\\nHere is an immortality, which laststill the fresh turf grows!\"\\n \"Up on the hill stood a man, a poet.\"\\nHe emptied the mead horn withthe broad silver  rim, and murmured a name.\"\\nHe begged the winds notto betray him, but I heard the name.\"\\n I knew it.\"\\nA count\\'s coronetsparkles above it, and therefore he did not speak it out.\"\\n I smiled,for I knew that a poet\\'s crown adorns his own name.\"\\nThe nobility ofEleanora  d\\'Este is attached to the name of Tasso.\"\\nAnd I also knowwhere the Rose of Beauty  blooms!\"\\n  Thus spake the Moon, and a cloud came between us.\"\\nMay no cloudseparate the poet from  the rose!\"\\n SEVENTH EVENING  \"Along the margin of the shore stretches a forest of firs andbeeches, and fresh and  fragrant is this wood; hundreds of nightingalesvisit it every spring.\"\\nClose beside  it is the sea, the ever-changingsea, and between the two is placed the broad high-road.\"\\n One carriageafter another rolls over it; but I did not follow them, for my eyeloves  best to rest upon one point.\"\\nA Hun\\'s Grave lies there, and thesloe and blackthorn  grow luxuriantly among the stones.\"\\nHere is truepoetry in nature.\"\\n \"And how do you think men appreciate this poetry?\"\\nI will tellyou what I heard there  last evening and during the night.\"\\n \"First, two rich landed proprietors came driving by.\"\\n\\'Those areglorious trees!\\' said  the first.\"\\n\\'Certainly; there are ten loads offirewood in each,\\' observed the other:  \\'it will be a hard winter,and last year we got fourteen dollars a load\\'- and they  were gone.\\'The road here is wretched,\\' observed another man who drove past.\\'That\\'s  the fault of those horrible trees,\\' replied his neighbour;\\'there is no free current  of air; the wind can only come from thesea\\'- and they were gone.\"\\nThe stage coach went  rattling past.\"\\nAllthe passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot.\"\\nThe postillion  blewhis horn, but he only thought, \\'I can play capitally.\"\\nIt sounds wellhere.\"\\nI wonder  if those in there like it?\\'- and the stage coachvanished.\"\\nThen two young fellows came  gallopping up on horseback.There\\'s youth and spirit in the blood here!\"\\nthought I;  and, indeed,they looked with a smile at the moss-grown hill and thick forest.\"\\n\\'Ishould  not dislike a walk here with the miller\\'s Christine,\\' said one-and they flew past.\"\\n \"The flowers scented the air; every breath of air was hushed; itseemed as if the sea  were a part of the sky that stretched above thedeep valley.\"\\nA carriage rolled by.\"\\n Six people were sitting in it.\"\\nFourof them were asleep; the fifth was thinking of  his new summer coat,which would suit him admirably; the sixth turned to the coachman  andasked him if there were anything remarkable connected with yonder heapof stones.\"\\n \\'No,\\' replied the coachman, \\'it\\'s only a heap of stones;but the trees are remarkable.\\'  \\'How so?\\' \\'Why I\\'ll tell you how theyare very remarkable.\"\\nYou see, in winter, when  the snow lies very deep,and has hidden the whole road so that nothing is to be seen,  thosetrees serve me for a landmark.\"\\nI steer by them, so as not to driveinto the sea;  and you see that is why the trees are remarkable.\\'  \"Now came a painter.\"\\nHe spoke not a word, but his eyes sparkled.He began to whistle.\"\\n At this the nightingales sang louder than ever.\\'Hold your tongues!\\' he cried testily;  and he made accurate notes ofall the colours and transitions- blue, and lilac, and  dark brown.\\'That will make a beautiful picture,\\' he said.\"\\nHe took it in just as amirror  takes in a view; and as he worked he whistled a march ofRossini.\"\\nAnd last of all came  a poor girl.\"\\nShe laid aside the burdenshe carried, and sat down to rest upon the Hun\\'s  Grave.\"\\nHer palehandsome face was bent in a listening attitude towards the forest.\"\\n Hereyes brightened, she gazed earnestly at the sea and the sky, her handswere folded,  and I think she prayed, \\'Our Father.\\' She herself couldnot understand the feeling  that swept through her, but I know thatthis minute, and the beautiful natural scene,  will live within hermemory for years, far more vividly and more truly than the  paintercould portray it with his colours on paper.\"\\nMy rays followed hertill the  morning dawn kissed her brow.\"\\n  EIGHTH EVENING  Heavy clouds obscured the sky, and the Moon did not make hisappearance at all.\"\\nI stood  in my little room, more lonely than ever,and looked up at the sky where he ought to  have shown himself.\"\\nMythoughts flew far away, up to my great friend, who every  eveningtold me such pretty tales, and showed me pictures.\"\\nYes, he has hadan experience  indeed.\"\\nHe glided over the waters of the Deluge, andsmiled on Noah\\'s ark just as he  lately glanced down upon me, andbrought comfort and promise of a new world that was  to spring forthfrom the old.\"\\nWhen the Children of Israel sat weeping by the waters  ofBabylon, he glanced mournfully upon the willows where hung thesilent harps.\"\\nWhen  Romeo climbed the balcony, and the promise oftrue love fluttered like a cherub toward  heaven, the round Moonhung, half hidden among the dark cypresses, in the lucid air.\"\\n He sawthe captive giant at St.\"\\nHelena, looking from the lonely rock acrossthe wide  ocean, while great thoughts swept through his soul.\"\\nAh!what tales the Moon can tell.\"\\n Human life is like a story to him.To-night I shall not see thee again, old friend.\"\\n Tonight I can draw nopicture of the memories of thy visit.\"\\nAnd, as I looked  dreamilytowards the clouds, the sky became bright.\"\\nThere was a glancing light,and  a beam from the Moon fell upon me.\"\\nIt vanished again, and darkclouds flew past: but  still it was a greeting, a friendly good-nightoffered to me by the Moon.\"\\n NINTH EVENING  The air was clear again.\"\\nSeveral evenings had passed, and the Moonwas in the first  quarter.\"\\nAgain he gave me an outline for a sketch.Listen to what he told me.\"\\n \"I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to theeastern coast of Greenland.\"\\n Gaunt ice-covered rocks and dark cloudshung over a valley, where dwarf willows and  barberry bushes stoodclothed in green.\"\\nThe blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours.\"\\n Mylight was faint, my face pale as the water lily that, torn from itsstem, has been  drifting for weeks with the tide.\"\\nThe crown-shapedNorthern Light burned fiercely in  the sky.\"\\nIts ring was broad, andfrom its circumference the rays shot like whirling  shafts of fireacross the whole sky, flashing in changing radiance from green to  red.The inhabitants of that icy region were assembling for dance andfestivity; but,  accustomed to this glorious spectacle, they scarcelydeigned to glance at it.\"\\n\\'Let  us leave the soul of the dead to theirball-play with the heads of the walruses,\\' they  thought in theirsuperstition, and they turned their whole attention to the song  anddance.\"\\nIn the midst of the circle, and divested of his furry cloak,stood a  Greenlander, with a small pipe, and he played and sang asong about catching the seal,  and the chorus around chimed in with,\\'Eia, Eia, Ah.\\' And in their white furs they  danced about in thecircle, till you might fancy it was a polar bear\\'s ball.\"\\n \"And now a Court of Judgment was opened.\"\\nThose Greenlanders whohad quarrelled stepped  forward, and the offended person chantedforth the faults of his adversary in an  extempore song, turning themsharply into ridicule, to the sound of the pipe and the  measure of thedance.\"\\nThe defendant replied with satire as keen, while the  audiencelaughed, and gave their verdict.\"\\nThe rocks heaved, the glaciersmelted, and  great masses of ice and snow came crashing down, shiveringto fragments as they fall;  it was a glorious Greenland summer night.\"\\nAhundred paces away, under the open tent  of hides, lay a sick man.\"\\nLifestill flowed through his warm blood, but still he was  to die- hehimself felt it, and all who stood round him knew it also; thereforehis  wife was already sewing round him the shroud of furs, that shemight not afterwards  be obliged to touch the dead body.\"\\nAnd she asked,\\'Wilt thou be buried on the rock,  in the firm snow?\"\\nI will deck thespot with thy kayak, and thy arrows, and the angekokk  shall dance overit.\"\\nOr wouldst thou rather be buried in the sea?\\' \\'In the sea,\\'  hewhispered, and nodded with a mournful smile.\"\\n\\'Yes, it is a pleasantsummer tent,  the sea,\\' observed the wife.\"\\n\\'Thousands of seals sportthere, the walrus shall lie  at thy feet, and the hunt will be safe andmerry!\\' And the yelling children tore the  outspread hide from thewindow-hole, that the dead man might be carried to the ocean,  thebillowy ocean, that had given him food in life, and that now, indeath, was to afford  him a place of rest.\"\\nFor his monument, he had thefloating, ever-changing icebergs,  whereon the seal sleeps, while thestorm bird flies round their gleaming summits!\"\\n  TENTH EVENING  \"I knew an old maid,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"Every winter she wore awrapper of yellow satin,  and it always remained new, and was theonly fashion she followed.\"\\nIn summer she always  wore the same strawhat, and I verily believe the very same gray-blue dress.\"\\n \"She never went out, except across the street to an old femalefriend; and in later  years she did not even take this walk, for theold friend was dead.\"\\nIn her solitude  my old maid was always busy atthe window, which was adorned in summer with pretty  flowers, and inwinter with cress, grown upon felt.\"\\nDuring the last months I saw herno  more at the window, but she was still alive.\"\\nI knew that, for I hadnot yet seen her  begin the \\'long journey,\\' of which she often spokewith her friend.\"\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' she  was in the habit of saying, when Icome to die I shall take a longer journey than I  have made my wholelife long.\"\\nOur family vault is six miles from here.\"\\nI shall be  carriedthere, and shall sleep there among my family and relatives.\\' Lastnight a van  stopped at the house.\"\\nA coffin was carried out, and then Iknew that she was dead.\"\\n They placed straw round the coffin, and thevan drove away.\"\\nThere slept the quiet old  lady, who had not gone outof her house once for the last year.\"\\nThe van rolled out  through thetown-gate as briskly as if it were going for a pleasant excursion.On the  high-road the pace was quicker yet.\"\\nThe coachman lookednervously round every now and  then- I fancy he half expected to seeher sitting on the coffin, in her yellow satin  wrapper.\"\\nAnd because hewas startled, he foolishly lashed his horses, while he held  thereins so tightly that the poor beasts were in a foam: they wereyoung and fiery.\"\\n A hare jumped across the road and startled them,and they fairly ran away.\"\\nThe old  sober maiden, who had for yearsand years moved quietly round and round in a dull circle,  was now,in death, rattled over stock and stone on the public highway.\"\\nThecoffin in  its covering of straw tumbled out of the van, and was lefton the high-road, while  horses, coachman, and carriage flew past inwild career.\"\\nThe lark rose up carolling  from the field, twittering hermorning lay over the coffin, and presently perched upon  it, pickingwith her beak at the straw covering, as though she would tear it up.The  lark rose up again, singing gaily, and I withdrew behind the redmorning clouds.\"\\n  ELEVENTH EVENING  \"I will give you a picture of Pompeii,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"I was inthe suburb in the  Street of Tombs, as they call it, where the fairmonuments stand, in the spot where,  ages ago, the merry youths,their temples bound with rosy wreaths, danced with the  fair sisters ofLais.\"\\nNow, the stillness of death reigned around.\"\\nGermanmercenaries,  in the Neapolitan service, kept guard, played cards,and diced; and a troop of  strangers from beyond the mountains cameinto the town, accompanied by a sentry.\"\\nThey  wanted to see the citythat had risen from the grave illumined by my beams; and I showed  themthe wheel-ruts in the streets paved with broad lava slabs; I showedthem the names  on the doors, and the signs that hung there yet: theysaw in the little courtyard the  basins of the fountains, ornamentedwith shells; but no jet of water gushed upwards,  no songs soundedforth from the richly-painted chambers, where the bronze dog keptthe  door.\"\\n \"It was the City of the Dead; only Vesuvius thundered forth hiseverlasting hymn, each  separate verse of which is called by men aneruption.\"\\nWe went to the temple of Venus,  built of snow-whitemarble, with its high altar in front of the broad steps, and  theweeping willows sprouting freshly forth among the pillars.\"\\nThe air wastransparent  and blue, and black Vesuvius formed the background, withfire ever shooting forth from  it, like the stem of the pine tree.Above it stretched the smoky cloud in the silence  of the night, likethe crown of the pine, but in a blood-red illumination.\"\\nAmong  thecompany was a lady singer, a real and great singer.\"\\nI have witnessedthe homage  paid to her in the greatest cities of Europe.\"\\nWhen theycame to the tragic theatre,  they all sat down on the amphitheatresteps, and thus a small part of the house was  occupied by an audience,as it had been many centuries ago.\"\\nThe stage still stood  unchanged,with its walled side-scenes, and the two arches in the background,through  which the beholders saw the same scene that had been exhibitedin the old times- a  scene painted by nature herself, namely, themountains between Sorento and Amalfi.\"\\n The singer gaily mounted theancient stage, and sang.\"\\nThe place inspired her, and she  reminded meof a wild Arab horse, that rushes headlong on with snorting nostrilsand  flying mane- her song was so light and yet so firm.\"\\nAnon I thoughtof the mourning  mother beneath the cross at Golgotha, so deep wasthe expression of pain.\"\\nAnd, just  as it had done thousands of yearsago, the sound of applause and delight now filled  the theatre.\"\\n\\'Happy,gifted creature!\\' all the hearers exclaimed.\"\\nFive minutes more,  andthe stage was empty, the company had vanished, and not a sound morewas heard- all  were gone.\"\\nBut the ruins stood unchanged, as theywill stand when centuries shall have  gone by, and when none shall knowof the momentary applause and of the triumph of the  fair songstress;when all will be forgotten and gone, and even for me this hour will  bebut a dream of the past.\"\\n  TWELFTH EVENING  \"I looked through the windows of an editor\\'s house,\" said theMoon.\"\\n\"It was somewhere  in Germany.\"\\nI saw handsome furniture, manybooks, and a chaos of newspapers.\"\\nSeveral  young men were present:the editor himself stood at his desk, and two little books,  both byyoung authors, were to be noticed.\"\\n\\'This one has been sent to me,\\'said he.\"\\n \\'I have not read it yet; what think you of the contents?\\'\\'Oh,\\' said the person  addressed- he was a poet himself- \\'it is goodenough; a little broad, certainly; but,  you see, the author is stillyoung.\"\\nThe verses might be better, to be sure; the thoughts  are sound,though there is certainly a good deal of common-place among them.But what  will you have?\"\\nYou can\\'t be always getting something new.That he\\'ll turn out anything  great I don\\'t believe, but you may safelypraise him.\"\\nHe is well read, a remarkable  Oriental scholar, and hasa good judgment.\"\\nIt was he who wrote that nice review of  my\\'Reflections on Domestic Life.\\' We must be lenient towards the youngman.\"\\n  \"\\'But he is a complete hack!\\' objected another of the gentlemen.\\'Nothing worse in  poetry than mediocrity, and he certainly does not gobeyond this.\\'  \"\\'Poor fellow,\\' observed a third, \\'and his aunt is so happyabout him.\"\\nIt was she,  Mr.\"\\nEditor, who got together so manysubscribers for your last translation.\\'  \"\\'Ah, the good woman!\"\\nWell, I have noticed the book briefly.Undoubted talent- a  welcome offering- a flower in the garden ofpoetry- prettily brought out- and so on.\"\\n But this other book- Isuppose the author expects me to purchase it?\"\\nI hear it is praised.\"\\n Hehas genius, certainly: don\\'t you think so?\\'  \"\\'Yes, all the world declares as much,\\' replied the poet, \\'butit has turned out rather  wildly.\"\\nThe punctuation of the book, inparticular, is very eccentric.\\'  \"\\'It will be good for him if we pull him to pieces, and angerhim a little, otherwise  he will get too good an opinion of himself.\\'  \"\\'But that would be unfair,\\' objected the fourth.\"\\n\\'Let us not carpat little faults,  but rejoice over the real and abundant good thatwe find here: he surpasses all the  rest.\\'  \"\\'Not so.\"\\nIf he is a true genius, he can bear the sharp voice ofcensure.\"\\nThere are  people enough to praise him.\"\\nDon\\'t let us quiteturn his head.\\'  \"\\'Decided talent,\\' wrote the editor, \\'with the usual carelessness.that he can write  incorrect verses may be seen in page 25, where thereare two false quantities.\"\\nWe  recommend him to study the ancients,etc.\\'  \"I went away,\" continued the Moon, \"and looked through the windowsin the aunt\\'s house.\"\\n There sat the be-praised poet, the tame one;all the guests paid homage to him, and  he was happy.\"\\n \"I sought the other poet out, the wild one; him also I found ina great assembly at  his patron\\'s, where the tame poet\\'s book was beingdiscussed.\"\\n \"\\'I shall read yours also,\\' said Maecenas; \\'but to speak honestly-you know I never  hide my opinion from you- I don\\'t expect much fromit, for you are much too wild, too  fantastic.\"\\nBut it must be allowedthat, as a man, you are highly respectable.\\'  \"A young girl sat in a corner; and she read in a book these words:  \"\\'In the dust lies genius and glory,  But ev\\'ry-day talent will pay.\"\\n It\\'s only the old, old story,  But the piece is repeated each day.\\'\"  THIRTEENTH EVENING  The Moon said, \"Beside the woodland path there are two smallfarm-houses.\"\\nThe doors  are low, and some of the windows are placedquite high, and others close to the ground;  and whitethorn andbarberry bushes grow around them.\"\\nThe roof of each house isovergrown  with moss and with yellow flowers and houseleek.\"\\nCabbage andpotatoes are the only  plants cultivated in the gardens, but out of thehedge there grows a willow tree, and  under this willow tree sat alittle girl, and she sat with her eyes fixed upon the  old oak treebetween the two huts.\"\\n \"It was an old withered stem.\"\\nIt had been sawn off at the top, anda stork had built  his nest upon it; and he stood in this nest clappingwith his beak.\"\\nA little boy came  and stood by the girl\\'s side: theywere brother and sister.\"\\n \"\\'What are you looking at?\\' he asked.\"\\n \"\\'I\\'m watching the stork,\\' she replied: \\'our neighbors told methat he would bring  us a little brother or sister to-day; let us watchto see it come!\\'  \"\\'The stork brings no such things,\\' the boy declared, \\'you maybe sure of that.\"\\nOur  neighbor told me the same thing, but shelaughed when she said it, and so I asked her  if she could say \\'On myhonor,\\' and she could not; and I know by that the story about  thestorks is not true, and that they only tell it to us children forfun.\\'  \"\\'But where do babies come from, then?\\' asked the girl.\"\\n \"\\'Why, an angel from heaven brings them under his cloak, but noman can see him; and  that\\'s why we never know when he brings them.\\'  \"At that moment there was a rustling in the branches of the willowtree, and the  children folded their hands and looked at one another:it was certainly the angel  coming with the baby.\"\\nThey took eachother\\'s hand, and at that moment the door of one  of the houses opened,and the neighbour appeared.\"\\n \"\\'Come in, you two,\\' she said.\"\\n\\'See what the stork has brought.\"\\nItis a little brother.\\'  \"And the children nodded gravely at one another, for they had feltquite sure already  that the baby was come.\"\\n  FOURTEENTH EVENING  \"I was gliding over the Luneburg Heath,\" the Moon said.\"\\n\"Alonely hut stood by the  wayside, a few scanty bushes grew near it, anda nightingale who had lost his way sang  sweetly.\"\\nHe died in thecoldness of the night: it was his farewell song that I heard.\"\\n \"The morning dawn came glimmering red.\"\\nI saw a caravan of emigrantpeasant families  who were bound to Hamburgh, there to take ship forAmerica, where fancied prosperity  would bloom for them.\"\\nThe motherscarried their little children at their backs, the  elder onestottered by their sides, and a poor starved horse tugged at a cartthat bore  their scanty effects.\"\\nThe cold wind whistled, andtherefore the little girl nestled  closer to the mother, who, lookingup at my decreasing disc, thought of the bitter  want at home, andspoke of the heavy taxes they had not been able to raise.\"\\nThe  wholecaravan thought of the same thing; therefore, the rising dawn seemedto them a  message from the sun, of fortune that was to gleambrightly upon them.\"\\nThey heard the  dying nightingale sing; it was nofalse prophet, but a harbinger of fortune.\"\\nThe wind  whistled,therefore they did not understand that the nightingale sung, \\'Fareaway over  the sea!\"\\nThou hast paid the long passage with all that wasthine, and poor and helpless  shalt thou enter Canaan.\"\\nThou must sellthyself, thy wife, and thy children.\"\\nBut your  griefs shall not lastlong.\"\\nBehind the broad fragrant leaves lurks the goddess of Death,  andher welcome kiss shall breathe fever into thy blood.\"\\nFare away, fareaway, over  the heaving billows.\\' And the caravan listened well pleasedto the song of the  nightingale, which seemed to promise goodfortune.\"\\nDay broke through the light clouds;  country people wentacross the heath to church; the black-gowned women with their  whitehead-dresses looked like ghosts that had stepped forth from the churchpictures.\"\\n All around lay a wide dead plain, covered with faded brownheath, and black charred  spaces between the white sand hills.\"\\nThewomen carried hymn books, and walked into  the church.\"\\nOh, pray, prayfor those who are wandering to find graves beyond the  foamingbillows.\"\\n  FIFTEENTH EVENING  \"I know a Pulcinella,\" the Moon told me.\"\\n\"The public applaudvociferously directly  they see him.\"\\nEvery one of his movements iscomic, and is sure to throw the house into  convulsions of laughter;and yet there is no art in it all- it is complete nature.\"\\n When hewas yet a little boy, playing about with other boys, he was alreadyPunch.\"\\nNature  had intended him for it, and had provided him with ahump on his back, and another  on his breast; but his inward man, hismind, on the contrary, was richly furnished.\"\\n No one could surpasshim in depth of feeling or in readiness of intellect.\"\\nThe  theatrewas his ideal world.\"\\nIf he had possessed a slender well-shaped figure,he might  have been the first tragedian on any stage; the heroic, thegreat, filled his soul;  and yet he had to become a Pulcinella.\"\\nHisvery sorrow and melancholy did but increase  the comic dryness of hissharply-cut features, and increased the laughter of the  audience,who showered plaudits on their favourite.\"\\nThe lovely Columbine wasindeed  kind and cordial to him; but she preferred to marry theHarlequin.\"\\nIt would have been  too ridiculous if beauty and uglinesshad in reality paired together.\"\\n \"When Pulcinella was in very bad spirits, she was the only one whocould force a hearty  burst of laughter, or even a smile from him:first she would be melancholy with him,  then quieter, and at lastquite cheerful and happy.\"\\n\\'I know very well what is the matter  withyou,\\' she said; \\'yes, you\\'re in love!\\' And he could not help laughing.\\'I and Love,\"  he cried, \"that would have an absurd look.\"\\nHow thepublic would shout!\\' \\'Certainly,  you are in love,\\' she continued;and added with a comic pathos, \\'and I am the person  you are in lovewith.\\' You see, such a thing may be said when it is quite out of  thequestion- and, indeed, Pulcinella burst out laughing, and gave aleap into the air,  and his melancholy was forgotten.\"\\n \"And yet she had only spoken the truth.\"\\nHe did love her, loveher adoringly, as he  loved what was great and lofty in art.\"\\nAt herwedding he was the merriest among the  guests, but in the stillnessof night he wept: if the public had seen his distorted  face then, theywould have applauded rapturously.\"\\n \"And a few days ago, Columbine died.\"\\nOn the day of the funeral,Harlequin was not  required to show himself on the boards, for he was adisconsolate widower.\"\\nThe director  had to give a very merry piece,that the public might not too painfully miss the pretty  Columbineand the agile Harlequin.\"\\nTherefore Pulcinella had to be moreboisterous and  extravagant than ever; and he danced and capered,with despair in his heart; and the  audience yelled, and shouted\\'bravo, bravissimo!\\' Pulcinella was actually called  before thecurtain.\"\\nHe was pronounced inimitable.\"\\n \"But last night the hideous little fellow went out of the town,quite alone, to the  deserted churchyard.\"\\nThe wreath of flowers onColumbine\\'s grave was already faded,  and he sat down there.\"\\nIt was astudy for a painter.\"\\nAs he sat with his chin on his  hands, his eyesturned up towards me, he looked like a grotesque monument- a Punchon  a grave- peculiar and whimsical!\"\\nIf the people could have seentheir favourite, they  would have cried as usual, \\'Bravo, Pulcinella;bravo, bravissimo!\\'\"  SIXTEENTH EVENING  Hear what the Moon told me.\"\\n\"I have seen the cadet who had justbeen made an officer  put on his handsome uniform for the first time; Ihave seen the young bride in her  wedding dress, and the princessgirl-wife happy in her gorgeous robes; but never have  I seen afelicity equal to that of a little girl of four years old, whom Iwatched this  evening.\"\\nShe had received a new blue dress, and a newpink hat, the splendid attire  had just been put on, and all werecalling for a candle, for my rays, shining in through  the windows ofthe room, were not bright enough for the occasion, and  furtherillumination was required.\"\\nThere stood the little maid, stiff andupright as  a doll, her arms stretched painfully straight out away fromthe dress, and her fingers  apart; and oh, what happiness beamed fromher eyes, and from her whole countenance!\"\\n \\'To-morrow you shall goout in your new clothes,\\' said her mother; and the little one  lookedup at her hat, and down at her frock, and smiled brightly.\"\\n\\'Mother,\\'she cried,  \\'what will the little dogs think, when they see me in thesesplendid new things?\\'\"  SEVENTEENTH EVENING  \"I have spoken to you of Pompeii,\" said the Moon; \"that corpseof a city, exposed in  the view of living towns: I know another sightstill more strange, and this is not  the corpse, but the spectre of acity.\"\\nWhenever the jetty fountains splash into the  marble basins, theyseem to me to be telling the story of the floating city.\"\\nYes,  thespouting water may tell of her, the waves of the sea may sing of herfame!\"\\nOn the  surface of the ocean a mist often rests, and that isher widow\\'s veil.\"\\nThe bridegroom  of the sea is dead, his palace andhis city are his mausoleum!\"\\nDost thou know this  city?\"\\nShe has neverheard the rolling of wheels or the hoof-tread of horses in  herstreets, through which the fish swim, while the black gondola glidesspectrally  over the green water.\"\\nI will show you the place,\" continuedthe Moon, \"the largest  square in it, and you will fancy yourselftransported into the city of a fairy tale.\"\\n The grass grows rankamong the broad flagstones, and in the morning twilight thousands  oftame pigeons flutter around the solitary lofty tower.\"\\nOn three sidesyou find  yourself surrounded by cloistered walks.\"\\nIn these thesilent Turk sits smoking his  long pipe, the handsome Greek leansagainst the pillar and gazes at the upraised  trophies and lofty masts,memorials of power that is gone.\"\\nThe flags hang down like  mourningscarves.\"\\nA girl rests there: she has put down her heavy pails filledwith water,  the yoke with which she has carried them rests on one ofher shoulders, and she leans  against the mast of victory.\"\\nThat isnot a fairy palace you see before you yonder,  but a church: the gildeddomes and shining orbs flash back my beams; the glorious bronze  horsesup yonder have made journeys, like the bronze horse in the fairy tale:they have  come hither, and gone hence, and have returned again.\"\\nDo younotice the variegated  splendour of the walls and windows?\"\\nIt looksas if Genius had followed the caprices  of a child, in the adornment ofthese singular temples.\"\\nDo you see the winged lion  on the pillar?The gold glitters still, but his wings are tied- the lion is dead, forthe  king of the sea is dead; the great halls stand desolate, and wheregorgeous paintings  hung of yore, the naked wall now peers through.\"\\nThelazzarone sleeps under the arcade,  whose pavement in old times wasto be trodden only by the feet of high nobility.\"\\nFrom  the deepwells, and perhaps from the prisons by the Bridge of Sighs, rise theaccents  of woe, as at the time when the tambourine was heard in thegay gondolas, and the golden  ring was cast from the Bucentaur toAdria, the queen of the seas.\"\\nAdria!\"\\nshroud thyself  in mists; letthe veil of thy widowhood shroud thy form, and clothe in the weedsof  woe the mausoleum of thy bridegroom- the marble, spectral Venice.\"\\n  EIGHTEENTH EVENING  \"I looked down upon a great theatre,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"The housewas crowded, for a  new actor was to make his first appearance thatnight.\"\\nMy rays glided over a little  window in the wall, and I saw apainted face with the forehead pressed against the  panes.\"\\nIt was thehero of the evening.\"\\nThe knighly beard curled crisply about thechin;  but there were tears in the man\\'s eyes, for he had been hissedoff, and indeed with  reason.\"\\nThe poor Incapable!\"\\nBut Incapables cannotbe admitted into the empire of Art.\"\\n He had deep feeling, and loved hisart enthusiastically, but the art loved not him.\"\\n The prompter\\'s bellsounded; \\'the hero enters with a determined air,\\' so ran the  stagedirection in his part, and he had to appear before an audience whoturned him  into ridicule.\"\\nWhen the piece was over, I saw a formwrapped in a mantle, creeping  down the steps: it was the vanquishedknight of the evening.\"\\nThe scene-shifters  whispered to one another,and I followed the poor fellow home to his room.\"\\nTo hang  one\\'s self isto die a mean death, and poison is not always at hand, I know; buthe  thought of both.\"\\nI saw how he looked at his pale face in the glass,with eyes half  closed, to see if he should look well as a corpse.\"\\nAman may be very unhappy, and yet  exceedingly affected.\"\\nHe thought ofdeath, of suicide; I believe he pitied himself,  for he weptbitterly, and when a man has had his cry out he doesn\\'t kill himself.\"\\n \"Since that time a year had rolled by.\"\\nAgain a play was to beacted, but in a little  theatre, and by a poor strolling company.\"\\nAgainI saw the well-remembered face, with  the painted cheeks and thecrisp beard.\"\\nHe looked up at me and smiled; and yet he had  been hissedoff only a minute before- hissed off from a wretched theatre, by amiserable  audience.\"\\nAnd tonight a shabby hearse rolled out of thetown-gate.\"\\nIt was a suicide\\ufffeour painted, despised hero.\"\\nThe driver ofthe hearse was the only person present, for  no one followed exceptmy beams.\"\\nIn a corner of the churchyard the corpse of the  suicidewas shovelled into the earth, and nettles will soon be growingrankly over his  grave, and the sexton will throw thorns and weeds fromthe other graves upon it.\"\\n  NINETEENTH EVENING  \"I come from Rome,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"In the midst of the city, uponone of the seven  hills, lie the ruins of the imperial palace.\"\\nThe wildfig tree grows in the clefts  of the wall, and covers the nakednessthereof with its broad grey-green leaves;  trampling among heaps ofrubbish, the ass treads upon green laurels, and rejoices over  the rankthistles.\"\\nFrom this spot, whence the eagles of Rome once flewabroad, whence  they \\'came, saw, and conquered,\\' our door leads intoa little mean house, built of  clay between two pillars; the wildvine hangs like a mourning garland over the crooked  window.\"\\nAn oldwoman and her little granddaughter live there: they rule now in  thepalace of the Caesars, and show to strangers the remains of its pastglories.\"\\nOf  the splendid throne-hall only a naked wall yet stands, anda black cypress throws its  dark shadow on the spot where the throneonce stood.\"\\nThe dust lies several feet deep  on the broken pavement;and the little maiden, now the daughter of the imperial  palace,often sits there on her stool when the evening bells ring.\"\\nThe keyholeof the  door close by she calls her turret window; through this she cansee half Rome, as far  as the mighty cupola of St.\"\\nPeter\\'s.\"\\n \"On this evening, as usual, stillness reigned around; and in thefull beam of my light  came the little granddaughter.\"\\nOn her head shecarried an earthen pitcher of antique  shape filled with water.\"\\nHerfeet were bare, her short frock and her white sleeves  were torn.\"\\nIkissed her pretty round shoulders, her dark eyes, and black shininghair.\"\\n She mounted the stairs; they were steep, having been made upof rough blocks of broken  marble and the capital of a fallen pillar.The coloured lizards slipped away, startled,  from before her feet, butshe was not frightened at them.\"\\nAlready she lifted her hand  to pullthe door-bell- a hare\\'s foot fastened to a string formed thebell-handle of  the imperial palace.\"\\nShe paused for a moment- of whatmight she be thinking?\"\\nPerhaps  of the beautiful Christ-child,dressed in gold and silver, which was down below in  the chapel,where the silver candlesticks gleamed so bright, and where herlittle  friends sung the hymns in which she also could join?\"\\nI knownot.\"\\nPresently she moved  again- she stumbled: the earthen vesselfell from her head, and broke on the marble  steps.\"\\nShe burst intotears.\"\\nThe beautiful daughter of the imperial palace wept over  theworthless broken pitcher; with her bare feet she stood thereweeping; and dared  not pull the string, the bell-rope of theimperial palace!\"\\n  TWENTIETH EVENING  It was more than a fortnight since the Moon had shone.\"\\nNow hestood once more, round  and bright, above the clouds, moving slowlyonward.\"\\nHear what the Moon told me.\"\\n \"From a town in Fezzan I followed a caravan.\"\\nOn the margin ofthe sandy desert, in  a salt plain, that shone like a frozen lake,and was only covered in spots with light  drifting sand, a halt wasmade.\"\\nThe eldest of the company- the water gourd hung at  his girdle,and on his head was a little bag of unleavened bread- drew a square inthe  sand with his staff, and wrote in it a few words out of the Koran,and then the whole  caravan passed over the consecrated spot.\"\\nA youngmerchant, a child of the East, as  I could tell by his eye and hisfigure, rode pensively forward on his white snorting  steed.\"\\nWas hethinking, perchance, of his fair young wife?\"\\nIt was only two daysago  that the camel, adorned with furs and with costly shawls, hadcarried her, the  beauteous bride, round the walls of the city, whiledrums and cymbals had sounded,  the women sang, and festive shots, ofwhich the bridegroom fired the greatest number,  resounded round thecamel; and now he was journeying with the caravan across the  desert.\"\\n \"For many nights I followed the train.\"\\nI saw them rest by thewellside among the stunted  palms; they thrust the knife into thebreast of the camel that had fallen, and roasted  its flesh by thefire.\"\\nMy beams cooled the glowing sands, and showed them the blackrocks,  dead islands in the immense ocean of sand.\"\\nNo hostile tribesmet them in their pathless  route, no storms arose, no columns ofsand whirled destruction over the journeying  caravan.\"\\nAt home thebeautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father.\"\\n\\'Are they  dead?\\'she asked of my golden crescent; \\'Are they dead?\\' she cried to my fulldisc.\"\\n Now the desert lies behind them.\"\\nThis evening they sit beneaththe lofty palm trees,  where the crane flutters round them with itslong wings, and the pelican watches them  from the branches of themimosa.\"\\nThe luxuriant herbage is trampled down, crushed by  the feet ofelephants.\"\\nA troop of negroes are returning from a market in theinterior  of the land: the women, with copper buttons in their blackhair, and decked out in  clothes dyed with indigo, drive theheavily-laden oxen, on whose backs slumber the  naked black children.\"\\nAnegro leads a young lion which he has brought, by a string.\"\\n Theyapproach the caravan; the young merchant sits pensive andmotionless, thinking  of his beautiful wife, dreaming, in the land ofthe blacks, of his white lily beyond  the desert.\"\\nHe raises his head,and- \" But at this moment a cloud passed before the  Moon, and thenanother.\"\\nI heard nothing more from him this evening.\"\\n TWENTY-FIRST EVENING  \"I saw a little girl weeping,\" said the Moon; \"she was weepingover the depravity of  the world.\"\\nShe had received a most beautifuldoll as a present.\"\\nOh, that was a glorious  doll, so fair and delicate!She did not seem created for the sorrows of this world.\"\\n But thebrothers of the little girl, those great naughty boys, had set thedoll high  up in the branches of a tree and had run away.\"\\n \"The little girl could not reach up to the doll, and could nothelp her down, and that  is why she was crying.\"\\nThe doll must certainlyhave been crying too, for she stretched  out her arms among the greenbranches, and looked quite mournful.\"\\nYes, these are the  troubles oflife of which the little girl had often heard tell.\"\\nAlas, poor doll!it  began to grow dark already; and suppose night were to come oncompletely!\"\\nWas she to  be left sitting on the bough all night long?No, the little maid could not make up  her mind to that.\"\\n\\'I\\'ll staywith you,\\' she said, although she felt anything but happy  in her mind.She could almost fancy she distinctly saw little gnomes, with  theirhigh-crowned hats, sitting in the bushes; and further back in the longwalk, tall  spectres appeared to be dancing.\"\\nThey came nearer andnearer, and stretched out their  hands towards the tree on which thedoll sat; they laughed scornfully, and pointed  at her with theirfingers.\"\\nOh, how frightened the little maid was!\"\\n\\'But if one has  notdone anything wrong,\\' she thought, \\'nothing evil can harm one.\"\\nIwonder if I have  done anything wrong?\\' And she considered.\"\\n\\'Oh, yes!\"\\nIlaughed at the poor duck with  the red rag on her leg; she limped alongso funnily, I could not help laughing; but  it\\'s a sin to laugh atanimals.\\' And she looked up at the doll.\"\\n\\'Did you laugh at the  ducktoo?\\' she asked; and it seemed as if the doll shook her head.\"\\n  TWENTY-SECOND EVENING  \"I looked down upon Tyrol,\" said the Moon, \"and my beams causedthe dark pines to throw  long shadows upon the rocks.\"\\nI looked at thepictures of St.\"\\nChristopher carrying the  Infant Jesus that are paintedthere upon the walls of the houses, colossal figures  reaching from theground to the roof.\"\\nSt.\"\\nFlorian was represented pouring water on  theburning house, and the Lord hung bleeding on the great cross by thewayside.\"\\nTo  the present generation these are old pictures, but I sawwhen they were put up, and  marked how one followed the other.\"\\nOn thebrow of the mountain yonder is perched, like  a swallow\\'s nest, alonely convent of nuns.\"\\nTwo of the sisters stood up in the  towertolling the bell; they were both young, and therefore their glancesflew over  the mountain out into the world.\"\\nA travelling coach passedby below, the postillion  wound his horn, and the poor nuns lookedafter the carriage for a moment with a mournful  glance, and a teargleamed in the eyes of the younger one.\"\\nAnd the horn sounded faint  andmore faintly, and the convent bell drowned its expiring echoes.\"\\n  TWENTY-THIRD EVENING  Hear what the Moon told me.\"\\n\"Some years ago, here in Copenhagen, Ilooked through the  window of a mean little room.\"\\nThe father and motherslept, but the little son was not  asleep.\"\\nI saw the flowered cottoncurtains of the bed move, and the child peep forth.\"\\n At first I thoughthe was looking at the great clock, which was gaily painted in redand  green.\"\\nAt the top sat a cuckoo, below hung the heavy leadenweights, and the pendulum  with the polished disc of metal went toand fro, and said \\'tick, tick.\\' But no, he  was not looking at theclock, but at his mother\\'s spinning wheel, that stood  justunderneath it.\"\\nThat was the boy\\'s favourite piece of furniture, but hedared not  touch it, for if he meddled with it he got a rap on theknuckles.\"\\nFor hours together,  when his mother was spinning, he wouldsit quietly by her side, watching the murmuring  spindle and therevolving wheel, and as he sat he thought of many things.\"\\nOh, if hemight  only turn the wheel himself!\"\\nFather and mother were asleep; helooked at them, and  looked at the spinning wheel, and presently alittle naked foot peered out of the bed,  and then a second foot, andthen two little white legs.\"\\nThere he stood.\"\\nHe looked round  once more,to see if father and mother were still asleep- yes, they slept; andnow he  crept softly, softly, in his short little nightgown, to thespinning wheel, and began  to spin.\"\\nThe thread flew from the wheel, andthe wheel whirled faster and faster.\"\\nI  kissed his fair hair and hisblue eyes, it was such a pretty picture.\"\\n \"At that moment the mother awoke.\"\\nThe curtain shook, she lookedforth, and fancied  she saw a gnome or some other kind of littlespectre.\"\\n\\'In Heaven\\'s name!\\' she cried,  and aroused her husband in afrightened way.\"\\nHe opened his eyes, rubbed them with his  hands, andlooked at the brisk little lad.\"\\n\\'Why, that is Bertel,\\' said he.\"\\nAnd myeye  quitted the poor room, for I have so much to see.\"\\nAt the samemoment I looked at the  halls of the Vatican, where the marble gods areenthroned.\"\\nI shone upon the group of  the Laocoon; the stone seemedto sigh.\"\\nI pressed a silent kiss on the lips of the Muses,  and theyseemed to stir and move.\"\\nBut my rays lingered longest about the Nilegroup  with the colossal god.\"\\nLeaning against the Sphinx, he lies therethoughtful and  meditative, as if he were thinking on the rollingcenturies; and little love-gods sport  with him and with thecrocodiles.\"\\nIn the horn of plenty sat with folded arms a little  tinylove-god, contemplating the great solemn river-god, a true pictureof the boy at  the spinning wheel- the features were exactly thesame.\"\\nCharming and life-like stood  the little marble form, and yet thewheel of the year has turned more than a thousand  times since the timewhen it sprang forth from the stone.\"\\nJust as often as the boy  in thelittle room turned the spinning wheel had the great wheel murmured,before the  age could again call forth marble gods equal to those heafterwards formed.\"\\n \"Years have passed since all this happened,\" the Moon went on tosay.\"\\n\"Yesterday I  looked upon a bay on the eastern coast of Denmark.Glorious woods are there, and high  trees, an old knightly castlewith red walls, swans floating in the ponds, and in the  backgroundappears, among orchards, a little town with a church.\"\\nMany boats,the crews  all furnished with torches, glided over the silentexpanse- but these fires had not  been kindled for catching fish, foreverything had a festive look.\"\\nMusic sounded, a  song was sung, andin one of the boats the man stood erect to whom homage was paid  by therest, a tall sturdy man, wrapped in a cloak.\"\\nHe had blue eyes and longwhite  hair.\"\\nI knew him, and thought of the Vatican, and of the groupof the Nile, and the  old marble gods.\"\\nI thought of the simple littleroom where little Bertel sat in his  night-shirt by the spinning wheel.The wheel of time has turned, and new gods have  come forth from thestone.\"\\nFrom the boats there arose a shout: \\'Hurrah, hurrah  forBertel Thorwaldsen!\\'\"  TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING  \"I will now give you a picture from Frankfort,\" said the Moon.\"\\nI especially noticed  one building there.\"\\nIt was not the house inwhich Goethe was born, nor the old Council  House, through whose gratedwindows peered the horns of the oxen that were roasted  and given tothe people when the emperors were crowned.\"\\nNo, it was a private house,plain  in appearance, and painted green.\"\\nIt stood near the old Jews\\'Street.\"\\nIt was  Rothschild\\'s house.\"\\n \"I looked through the open door.\"\\nThe staircase was brilliantlylighted: servants  carrying wax candles in massive silvercandlesticks stood there, and bowed low before  an old woman, who wasbeing brought downstairs in a litter.\"\\nThe proprietor of the  housestood bare-headed, and respectfully imprinted a kiss on the hand ofthe old woman.\"\\n She was his mother.\"\\nShe nodded in a friendly mannerto him and to the servants, and  they carried her into the darknarrow street, into a little house, that was her dwelling.\"\\n Here herchildren had been born, from hence the fortune of the family hadarisen.\"\\nIf  she deserted the despised street and the little house,fortune would also desert her  children.\"\\nThat was her firm belief.\"\\n  The Moon told me no more; his visit this evening was far tooshort.\"\\nBut I thought of  the old woman in the narrow despised street.It would have cost her but a word, and  a brilliant house would havearisen for her on the banks of the Thames- a word, and  a villa wouldhave been prepared in the Bay of Naples.\"\\n \"If I deserted the lowly house, where the fortunes of my sonsfirst began to bloom,  fortune would desert them!\"\\n It was asuperstition, but a superstition of such a class,  that he who knowsthe story and has seen this picture, need have only two words  placedunder the picture to make him understand it; and these two wordsare: \"A mother.\"\\n  TWENTY-FIFTH EVENING  \"It was yesterday, in the morning twilight\"- these are the wordsthe Moon told me-  \"in the great city no chimney was yet smoking- andit was just at the chimneys that  I was looking.\"\\nSuddenly a little heademerged from one of them, and then half a body,  the arms resting onthe rim of the chimney-pot.\"\\n\\'Ya-hip!\"\\nya-hip!\\' cried a voice.\"\\nIt  wasthe little chimney-sweeper, who had for the first time in his lifecrept through  a chimney, and stuck out his head at the top.\"\\n\\'Ya-hip!ya-hip\\' Yes, certainly that  was a very different thing to creepingabout in the dark narrow chimneys!\"\\nthe air blew  so fresh, and he couldlook over the whole city towards the green wood.\"\\nThe sun was  justrising.\"\\nIt shone round and great, just in his face, that beamed withtriumph,  though it was very prettily blacked with soot.\"\\n \"\\'The whole town can see me now,\\' he exclaimed, \\'and the mooncan see me now, and the  sun too.\"\\nYa-hip!\"\\nya-hip!\\' And he flourishedhis broom in triumph.\"\\n  TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING  \"Last night I looked down upon a town in China,\" said the Moon.\"\\nMy beams irradiated  the naked walls that form the streets there.Now and then, certainly, a door is seen;  but it is locked, for whatdoes the Chinaman care about the outer world?\"\\nClose wooden  shutterscovered the windows behind the walls of the houses; but through thewindows  of the temple a faint light glimmered.\"\\nI looked in, and sawthe quaint decorations  within.\"\\nFrom the floor to the ceilingpictures are painted, in the most glaring colours,  and richly gilt-pictures representing the deeds of the gods here on earth.\"\\nIn  eachniche statues are placed, but they are almost entirely hidden by thecoloured  drapery and the banners that hang down.\"\\nBefore each idol (andthey are all made of  tin) stood a little altar of holy water, withflowers and burning wax lights on it.\"\\n Above all the rest stood Fo, thechief deity, clad in a garment of yellow silk, for  yellow is herethe sacred colour.\"\\nAt the foot of the altar sat a living being, ayoung  priest.\"\\nHe appeared to be praying, but in the midst of hisprayer he seemed to fall  into deep thought, and this must have beenwrong, for his cheeks glowed and he held  down his head.\"\\nPoorSoui-Hong!\"\\nWas he, perhaps, dreaming of working in the little  flowergarden behind the high street wall?\"\\nAnd did that occupation seemmore agreeable  to him than watching the wax lights in the temple?\"\\nOrdid he wish to sit at the rich  feast, wiping his mouth with silverpaper between each course?\"\\nOr was his sin so great  that, if he daredutter it, the Celestial Empire would punish it with death?\"\\nHad  histhoughts ventured to fly with the ships of the barbarians, to theirhomes in far  distant England?\"\\nNo, his thoughts did not fly so far, andyet they were sinful, sinful  as thoughts born of young hearts,sinful here in the temple, in the presence of Fo  and the other holygods.\"\\n \"I know whither his thoughts had strayed.\"\\nAt the farther end ofthe city, on the flat  roof paved with porcelain, on which stood thehandsome vases covered with painted  flowers, sat the beauteous Pu,of the little roguish eyes, of the full lips, and of  the tiny feet.The tight shoe pained her, but her heart pained her still more.\"\\nShelifted  her graceful round arm, and her satin dress rustled.\"\\nBefore herstood a glass bowl  containing four gold-fish.\"\\nShe stirred the bowlcarefully with a slender lacquered  stick, very slowly, for she, too,was lost in thought.\"\\nWas she thinking, perchance,  how the fisheswere richly clothed in gold, how they lived calmly and peacefully  intheir crystal world, how they were regularly fed, and yet how muchhappier they might  be if they were free?\"\\nYes, that she could wellunderstand, the beautiful Pu.\"\\nHer  thoughts wandered away from herhome, wandered to the temple, but not for the sake  of holy things.Poor Pu!\"\\nPoor Soui-hong!\"\\n \"Their earthly thoughts met, but my cold beam lay between the two,like the sword of  the cherub.\"\\n  TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING  \"The air was calm,\" said the Moon; \"the water was transparent asthe purest ether  through which I was gliding, and deep below thesurface I could see the strange plants  that stretched up their longarms towards me like the gigantic trees of the forest.\"\\n The fishes swamto and fro above their tops.\"\\nHigh in the air a flight of wild swanswere  winging their way, one of which sank lower and lower, withwearied pinions, his eyes  following the airy caravan, that meltedfarther and farther into the distance.\"\\nWith  outspread wings he sankslowly, as a soap bubble sinks in the still air, till he touched  thewater.\"\\nAt length his head lay back between his wings, and silentlyhe lay there,  like a white lotus flower upon the quiet lake.\"\\nAnd agentle wind arose, and crisped  the quiet surface, which gleamed likethe clouds that poured along in great broad waves;  and the swan raisedhis head, and the glowing water splashed like blue fire over  hisbreast and back.\"\\nThe morning dawn illuminated the red clouds, the swanrose  strengthened, and flew towards the rising sun, towards the bluishcoast whither the  caravan had gone; but he flew alone, with alonging in his breast.\"\\nLonely he flew over  the blue swelling billows.\"\\n  TWENTY-EIGHTH EVENING  \"I will give you another picture of Sweden,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"Amongdark pine woods,  near the melancholy banks of the Stoxen, lies the oldconvent church of Wreta.\"\\nMy rays  glided through the grating into theroomy vaults, where kings sleep tranquilly in great  stone coffins.On the wall, above the grave of each, is placed the emblem ofearthly  grandeur, a kingly crown; but it is made only of wood, paintedand gilt, and is hung  on a wooden peg driven into the wall.\"\\nTheworms have gnawed the gilded wood, the spider  has spun her web fromthe crown down to the sand, like a mourning banner, frail  andtransient as the grief of mortals.\"\\nHow quietly they sleep!\"\\nI canremember them quite  plainly.\"\\nI still see the bold smile on their lips,that so strongly and plainly  expressed joy or grief.\"\\nWhen thesteamboat winds along like a magic snail over the  lakes, a strangeroften comes to the church, and visits the burial vault; he asks  thenames of the kings, and they have a dead and forgotten sound.\"\\nHeglances with a  smile at the worm-eaten crowns, and if he happens to bea pious, thoughtful man,  something of melancholy mingles with thesmile.\"\\nSlumber on, ye dead ones!\"\\nThe Moon  thinks of you, the Moon atnight sends down his rays into your silent kingdom, over  which hangsthe crown of pine wood.\"\\n  TWENTY-NINTH EVENING  \"Close by the high-road,\" said the Moon, \"is an inn, andopposite to it is a great  waggon-shed, whose straw roof was just beingre-thatched.\"\\nI looked down between the  bare rafters and through theopen loft into the comfortless space below.\"\\nThe  turkey-cock slept onthe beam, and the saddle rested in the empty crib.\"\\nIn the middle  ofthe shed stood a travelling carriage; the proprietor was inside,fast asleep, while  the horses were being watered.\"\\nThe coachmanstretched himself, though I am very sure  that he had been mostcomfortably asleep half the last stage.\"\\nThe door of the servants\\'  roomstood open, and the bed looked as if it had been turned over and over;the candle  stood on the floor, and had burnt deep down into thesocket.\"\\nThe wind blew cold through  the shed: it was nearer to the dawnthan to midnight.\"\\nIn the wooden frame on the ground  slept a wanderingfamily of musicians.\"\\nThe father and mother seemed to be dreaming  ofthe burning liquor that remained in the bottle.\"\\nThe little paledaughter was dreaming  too, for her eyes were wet with tears.\"\\nThe harpstood at their heads, and the dog lay  stretched at their feet.\"\\n  THIRTIETH EVENING  \"It was in a little provincial town,\" the Moon said; \"it certainlyhappened last year,  but that has nothing to do with the matter.\"\\nIsaw it quite plainly.\"\\nTo-day I read about  it in the papers, butthere it was not half so clearly expressed.\"\\nIn the taproom of  thelittle inn sat the bear leader, eating his supper; the bear was tiedup outside,  behind the wood pile- poor Bruin, who did nobody any harm,though he looked grim enough.\"\\n Up in the garret three little childrenwere playing by the light of my beams; the eldest  was perhaps sixyears old, the youngest certainly not more than two.\"\\n\\'Tramp,  tramp\\'-somebody was coming upstairs: who might it be?\"\\nThe door was thrustopen- it  was Bruin, the great, shaggy Bruin!\"\\nHe had got tired ofwaiting down in the courtyard,  and had found his way to the stairs.I saw it all,\" said the Moon.\"\\n\"The children were  very muchfrightened at first at the great shaggy animal; each of them creptinto a  corner, but he found them all out, and smelt at them, but didthem no harm.\"\\n\\'This must  be a great dog,\\' they said, and began tostroke him.\"\\nHe lay down upon the ground, the  youngest boy clambered onhis back, and bending down a little head of golden curls,  played athiding in the beast\\'s shaggy skin.\"\\nPresently the eldest boy took hisdrum,  and beat upon it till it rattled again; the bear rose upon hishind legs, and began  to dance.\"\\nIt was a charming sight to behold.\"\\nEachboy now took his gun, and the bear  was obliged to have one too, and heheld it up quite properly.\"\\nHere was a capital  playmate they had found;and they began marching- one, two; one, two.\"\\n \"Suddenly some one came to the door, which opened, and themother of the children  appeared.\"\\nYou should have seen her in herdumb terror, with her face as white as chalk,  her mouth half open, andher eyes fixed in a horrified stare.\"\\nBut the youngest boy  nodded toher in great glee, and called out in his infantile prattle, \\'We\\'replaying  at soldiers.\\' And then the bear leader came running up.\"\\n  THIRTY-FIRST EVENING  The wind blew stormy and cold, the clouds flew hurriedly past;only for a moment now  and then did the Moon become visible.\"\\nHe said,\"I looked down from the silent sky upon  the driving clouds, and sawthe great shadows chasing each other across the earth.\"\\n I looked upon aprison.\"\\nA closed carriage stood before it; a prisoner was to becarried  away.\"\\nMy rays pierced through the grated window towards thewall; the prisoner was  scratching a few lines upon it, as a partingtoken; but he did not write words, but  a melody, the outpouring of hisheart.\"\\nThe door was opened, and he was led forth, and  fixed his eyesupon my round disc.\"\\nClouds passed between us, as if he were not to seehis  face, nor I his.\"\\nHe stepped into the carriage, the door wasclosed, the whip cracked,  and the horses gallopped off into thethick forest, whither my rays were not able to  follow him; but as Iglanced through the grated window, my rays glided over the  notes,his last farewell engraved on the prison wall- where words fail,sounds can often  speak.\"\\nMy rays could only light up isolated notes, sothe greater part of what was  written there will ever remain dark tome.\"\\nWas it the death-hymn he wrote there?\"\\nWere  these the glad notes ofjoy?\"\\nDid he drive away to meet death, or hasten to the embraces  of hisbeloved?\"\\nThe rays of the Moon do not read all that is written bymortals.\"\\n  THIRTY-SECOND EVENING  \"I love the children,\" said the Moon, \"especially the quite littleones- they are so  droll.\"\\nSometimes I peep into the room, between thecurtain and the window frame, when  they are not thinking of me.\"\\nItgives me pleasure to see them dressing and undressing.\"\\n First, thelittle round naked shoulder comes creeping out of the frock, thenthe arm;  or I see how the stocking is drawn off, and a plump littlewhite leg makes its appearance,  and a white little foot that is fit tobe kissed, and I kiss it too.\"\\n \"But about what I was going to tell you.\"\\nThis evening I lookedthrough a window, before  which no curtain was drawn, for nobodylives opposite.\"\\nI saw a whole troop of little  ones, all of one family,and among them was a little sister.\"\\nShe is only four years  old, butcan say her prayers as well as any of the rest.\"\\nThe mother sits by herbed  every evening, and hears her say her prayers; and then she has akiss, and the mother  sits by the bed till the little one has gone tosleep, which generally happens as soon  as ever she can close her eyes.\"\\n \"This evening the two elder children were a little boisterous.\"\\nOneof them hopped about  on one leg in his long white nightgown, and theother stood on a chair surrounded by  the clothes of all thechildren, and declared he was acting Grecian statues.\"\\nThe third  andfourth laid the clean linen carefully in the box, for that is athing that has to  be done; and the mother sat by the bed of theyoungest, and announced to all the rest  that they were to be quiet,for little sister was going to say her prayers.\"\\n \"I looked in, over the lamp, into the little maiden\\'s bed, whereshe lay under the  neat white coverlet, her hands folded demurely andher little face quite grave and  serious.\"\\nShe was praying the Lord\\'sprayer aloud.\"\\nBut her mother interrupted her in  the middle of herprayer.\"\\n\\'How is it,\\' she asked, \\'that when you have prayed for  dailybread, you always add something I cannot understand?\"\\nYou must tellme what that  is.\\' The little one lay silent, and looked at hermother in embarrassment.\"\\n\\'What is  it you say after our daily bread?\\'\\'Dear mother, don\\'t be angry: I only said, and plenty  of butter onit.\\'\"  THE END.\"\\n 1872  FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN  WHAT THE OLD MAN DOES IS ALWAYS RIGHT  by Hans Christian Andersen  I WILL tell you a story that was told me when I was a littleboy.\"\\nEvery time I thought  of this story, it seemed to me more and morecharming; for it is with stories as it  is with many people- theybecome better as they grow older.\"\\n I have no doubt that you have been in the country, and seen a veryold farmhouse, with  a thatched roof, and mosses and small plantsgrowing wild upon it.\"\\nThere is a stork\\'s  nest on the ridge of thegable, for we cannot do without the stork.\"\\nThe walls of the  houseare sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter ismade to open.\"\\n The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a greatknob.\"\\nAn elder-tree hangs over  the palings; and beneath itsbranches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water,  in which afew ducks are disporting themselves.\"\\nThere is a yard-dog too, whobarks at  all corners.\"\\nJust such a farmhouse as this stood in a countrylane; and in it dwelt  an old couple, a peasant and his wife.\"\\nSmallas their possessions were, they had one  article they could not dowithout, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon  thegrass which it found by the side of the high road.\"\\nThe old peasantrode into the  town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowedit of him, and paid for the  loan of it by rendering some service tothe old couple.\"\\nAfter a time they thought it  would be as well tosell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be  moreuseful to them.\"\\nBut what might this something be?\"\\n \"You\\'ll know best, old man,\" said the wife.\"\\n\"It is fair-dayto-day; so ride into town,  and get rid of the horse for money, or makea good exchange; whichever you do will  be right to me, so ride to thefair.\"\\n  And she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do thatbetter than he could,  and she could also tie it very prettily in adouble bow.\"\\nShe also smoothed his hat  round and round with the palm ofher hand, and gave him a kiss.\"\\nThen he rode away upon  the horse thatwas to be sold or bartered for something else.\"\\nYes, the old man knewwhat  he was about.\"\\nThe sun shone with great heat, and not a cloudwas to be seen in the  sky.\"\\nThe road was very dusty; for a number ofpeople, all going to the fair, were driving,  riding, or walking uponit.\"\\nThere was no shelter anywhere from the hot sunshine.\"\\nAmong  therest a man came trudging along, and driving a cow to the fair.\"\\nThe cowwas as  beautiful a creature as any cow could be.\"\\n \"She gives good milk, I am certain,\" said the peasant tohimself.\"\\n\"That would be a  very good exchange: the cow for the horse.Hallo there!\"\\nyou with the cow,\" he said.\"\\n \"I tell you what; I daresay a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don\\'t care  for that,- acow will be more useful to me; so, if you like, we\\'ll exchange.\"\\n  \"To be sure I will,\" said the man.\"\\n Accordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter wassettled, the peasant might  have turned back; for he had done thebusiness he came to do.\"\\nBut, having made up his  mind to go to thefair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so on  hewent to the town with his cow.\"\\nLeading the animal, he strode onsturdily, and, after  a short time, overtook a man who was driving asheep.\"\\nIt was a good fat sheep, with  a fine fleece on its back.\"\\n \"I should like to have that fellow,\" said the peasant tohimself.\"\\n\"There is plenty  of grass for him by our palings, and inthe winter we could keep him in the room with  us.\"\\nPerhaps it wouldbe more profitable to have a sheep than a cow.\"\\nShall I exchange?\"\\n  The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain wasquickly made.\"\\nAnd then  our peasant continued his way on thehigh-road with his sheep.\"\\nSoon after this, he  overtook another man,who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a  largegoose under his arm.\"\\n \"What a heavy creature you have there!\"\\n said the peasant; \"ithas plenty of feathers  and plenty of fat, and would look well tiedto a string, or paddling in the water at  our place.\"\\nThat would be veryuseful to my old woman; she could make all sorts of profits  out of it.How often she has said, \\'If now we only had a goose!\\' Now here is  anopportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for her.\"\\nShall weexchange?\"\\nI will give  you my sheep for your goose, and thanks into thebargain.\"\\n  The other had not the least objection, and accordingly theexchange was made, and our  peasant became possessor of the goose.\"\\nBythis time he had arrived very near the town.\"\\n The crowd on the highroad had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush  ofmen and cattle.\"\\nThe cattle walked on the path and by the palings,and at the  turnpike-gate they even walked into the toll-keeper\\'spotato-field, where one fowl  was strutting about with a string tied toits leg, for fear it should take fright at  the crowd, and run away andget lost.\"\\nThe tail-feathers of the fowl were very short,  and it winkedwith both its eyes, and looked very cunning, as it said \"Cluck,cluck.\"\\n  What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this I cannottell you; but directly  our good man saw it, he thought, \"Why that\\'sthe finest fowl I ever saw in my life;  it\\'s finer than our parson\\'sbrood hen, upon my word.\"\\nI should like to have that fowl.\"\\n Fowls canalways pick up a few grains that lie about, and almost keepthemselves.\"\\nI  think it would be a good exchange if I could get itfor my goose.\"\\nShall we exchange?\"\\n  he asked the toll-keeper.\"\\n \"Exchange,\" repeated the man; \"well, it would not be a bad thing.\"\\n  And so they made an exchange,- the toll-keeper at theturnpike-gate kept the goose,  and the peasant carried off the fowl.Now he had really done a great deal of business  on his way to thefair, and he was hot and tired.\"\\nHe wanted something to eat, and aglass  of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an inn.He was just about to enter  when the ostler came out, and they met atthe door.\"\\nThe ostler was carrying a sack.\"\\n \"What have you in thatsack?\"\\n asked the peasant.\"\\n \"Rotten apples,\" answered the ostler; \"a whole sackful of them.They will do to feed  the pigs with.\"\\n  \"Why that will be terrible waste,\" he replied; \"I should like totake them home to  my old woman.\"\\nLast year the old apple-tree by thegrass-plot only bore one apple, and  we kept it in the cupboard till itwas quite withered and rotten.\"\\nIt was always property,  my old womansaid; and here she would see a great deal of property- a wholesackful;  I should like to show them to her.\"\\n  \"What will you give me for the sackful?\"\\n asked the ostler.\"\\n \"What will I give?\"\\nWell, I will give you my fowl in exchange.\"\\n  So he gave up the fowl, and received the apples, which hecarried into the inn parlor.\"\\n He leaned the sack carefully againstthe stove, and then went to the table.\"\\nBut the  stove was hot, and hehad not thought of that.\"\\nMany guests were present- horse  dealers,cattle drovers, and two Englishmen.\"\\nThe Englishmen were so rich thattheir  pockets quite bulged out and seemed ready to burst; and theycould bet too, as you  shall hear.\"\\n\"Hiss-s-s, hiss-s-s.\"\\n What couldthat be by the stove?\"\\nThe apples were  beginning to roast.\"\\n\"What isthat?\"\\n asked one.\"\\n \"Why, do you know\"- said our peasant.\"\\nAnd then he told them thewhole story of the  horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and allthe rest of it, down to the apples.\"\\n \"Well, your old woman will give it you well when you get home,\"said one of the  Englishmen.\"\\n\"Won\\'t there be a noise?\"\\n  \"What!\"\\nGive me what?\"\\n said the peasant.\"\\n\"Why, she will kiss me,and say, \\'what the  old man does is always right.\\'\"  \"Let us lay a wager on it,\" said the Englishmen.\"\\n\"We\\'ll wageryou a ton of coined gold,  a hundred pounds to the hundred-weight.\"\\n  \"No; a bushel will be enough,\" replied the peasant.\"\\n\"I can onlyset a bushel of apples  against it, and I\\'ll throw myself and my oldwoman into the bargain; that will pile  up the measure, I fancy.\"\\n  \"Done!\"\\ntaken!\"\\n and so the bet was made.\"\\n Then the landlord\\'s coach came to the door, and the two Englishmenand the peasant  got in, and away they drove, and soon arrived andstopped at the peasant\\'s hut.\"\\n\"Good  evening, old woman.\"\\n \"Goodevening, old man.\"\\n \"I\\'ve made the exchange.\"\\n  \"Ah, well, you understand what you\\'re about,\" said the woman.\"\\nThenshe embraced him,  and paid no attention to the strangers, nor didshe notice the sack.\"\\n \"I got a cow in exchange for the horse.\"\\n  \"Thank Heaven,\" said she.\"\\n\"Now we shall have plenty of milk, andbutter, and cheese  on the table.\"\\nThat was a capital exchange.\"\\n  \"Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep.\"\\n  \"Ah, better still!\"\\n cried the wife.\"\\n\"You always think ofeverything; we have just  enough pasture for a sheep.\"\\nEwe\\'s milk andcheese, woollen jackets and stockings!\"\\nThe  cow could not give allthese, and her hair only falls off.\"\\nHow you think of everything!\"\\n  \"But I changed away the sheep for a goose.\"\\n  \"Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year.\"\\nYou dear oldman, you are always  thinking of something to please me.\"\\nThis isdelightful.\"\\nWe can let the goose walk about  with a string tied toher leg, so she will be fatter still before we roast her.\"\\n  \"But I gave away the goose for a fowl.\"\\n  \"A fowl!\"\\nWell, that was a good exchange,\" replied the woman.\"\\nThe fowl will lay eggs  and hatch them, and we shall have chickens; weshall soon have a poultry-yard.\"\\nOh,  this is just what I was wishingfor.\"\\n  \"Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples.\"\\n  \"What!\"\\nI really must give you a kiss for that!\"\\n exclaimed thewife.\"\\n\"My dear, good  husband, now I\\'ll tell you something.\"\\nDo youknow, almost as soon as you left me this  morning, I began to thinkof what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and  then Ithought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs; I had eggs andbacon, but  I wanted the herbs; so I went over to the schoolmaster\\'s: Iknew they had plenty of  herbs, but the schoolmistress is very mean,although she can smile so sweetly.\"\\nI begged  her to lend me a handfulof herbs.\"\\n\\'Lend!\\' she exclaimed, \\'I have nothing to lend;  nothing atall grows in our garden, not even a shrivelled apple; I could not evenlend  you a shrivelled apple, my dear woman.\"\\nBut now I can lend herten, or a whole sackful,  which I\\'m very glad of; it makes me laughto think about it;\" and then she gave him  a hearty kiss.\"\\n \"Well, I like all this,\" said both the Englishmen; \"always goingdown the hill, and  yet always merry; it\\'s worth the money to seeit.\"\\n So they paid a hundred-weight of  gold to the peasant, who,whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.\"\\n Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that herhusband knows best,  and whatever he does is right.\"\\n That is a story which I heard when I was a child; and now you haveheard it too, and  know that \"What the old man does is always right.\"\\n  THE END.'"
